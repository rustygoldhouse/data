Sir Thomas Browne said the \n"devils" of holy scripture were Fauns, Satyrs, and sons of Pan; but the \noriginal Hebrew word for them was "goats." 9 In Scotland, the devil \nwas known as Ould Hornie. His notorious lustfulness gave rise to the \nmodern slang term "horny." The so-called sign of the devil \nforefinger and little finger extended was originally a gesture-symbol of \na horned animal head, copied from a sacred mudra of the Great \nGoddess in India. 10 \n\n1.

Out of a Christian \nprejudice against queens, the Venerable Bede insisted that the \nStallion and Mare were really two brothers ruling jointly, but he never \nexplained how they managed to become joint parents. 4 \n\nSymbolic of the equine deities was a double-headed androgynous \nhorse still used to decorate the double projecting rafters of old houses \nin Jutland, the original home of the Jutes. Such figures are known as \nHengist and Horsa and are put up for "luck." 5 \n\nAnother relic of pre-Christian horse worship is the Morris dancer\'s \ntraditional horse-headed stick, or "hobby horse" otherwise the \ncock-horse ridden to Banbury Cross to see the Goddess make her ritual \nride as Lady Codiva. Similar horse-headed sticks were ridden by \ncentral Asian shamans. "The \'horse\' enables the shaman to fly through \nthe air, to reach the heavens. The dominant aspect of the mythology \nof the horse is not infernal but funerary; the horse is a mythical image of \ndeath and hence is incorporated into the ideologies and techniques of \necstasy." 6 Death symbolism figured in the dream of riding a black \nhorse, interpreted as a portent of "loss and sorrow." 7 \n\nNorthern Europeans considered horses essential to the funeral \nrites of great warriors. The riderless horse led in a pagan or Christian \nmilitary officer\'s funeral procession dated back to primitive belief that his \nghost needed to ride to heaven. His empty boots were often fixed \nbackward in the stirrups because it was thought ghosts wore their feet \nbackward. In ancient times, the horse was usually sacrificed at the \nfuneral and buried with the dead hero, just as boats were buried with \nEgyptian mummies to carry them over afterworld waters. 8 \n\nDeath was the significance of Father Odin\'s eight-legged gray \nhorse Sleipnir, symbol of the gallows tree, where human sacrifices \nwere hung in Odin\'s sacred groves. Skalds called the gallows "high- \nchested rope-Sleipnir," the horse on which men rode to the land of \ndeath, Heljar. Recounting Odin\'s own death-and-resurrectiop drama, \nthe original nine-day wonder, the Elder Edda said: "In the Norn\'s \n\n\n\n411 \n\n\n\nHorse seat nine days sat I, thence was I mounted on a horse; there the \n\ngiantess\'s sun shone grimly through the dripping clouds of heaven. \n^hh^^^^h^^h Without and within, I seemed to traverse all the seven nether worlds." 9 \n\nOld Norse drasil meant both "horse" and "gallows tree." 10 There \nfore the World Tree Yggdrasil, on which Odin hung and bled, was \nboth the Horse of Yggr and the Gallows of Yggr, as well as the axis \nmundial the earth\'s hub. Yggr was another name for Odin as Lord of \nDeath. When Christians diabolized him, he became the great devil- \nrider leading the hosts of the dead through the sky on their \ncloud-colored horses, and Yggr evolved into the English "ogre." " \n\nThe horse cult of Odin\'s Aesir was rooted in Vedic India. Hind \ndying gods often assumed horse shape. Hindu queens impersonated \nthe Goddess as Mare-mother, Saranyu, by inserting the dead horse\'s \npenis between their legs at the end of the sacrificial ceremony, calling \nupon "the vigorous male" to "lay seed" for the benefit of the land and \nits people. 12 \n\nThis ancient ceremony explains one of Odin\'s more puzzling \ntitles, Volsi, meaning both "Son of God" and "Horse\'s Penis." 13 \nThe penis was the "son" worshipped by Iron Age equestrian tribes \ncalling themselves Volsungs, descendants of Volsi. The cult was not \nconfined to Scandinavia. The Welsh had the same ancestral horse-goc \nWaelsi or Waels. Slavs also worshipped him as Volos, a sacrificed \nhorse whose entrails and blood were supposed to produce the water of \nlife. In a Russian folk tale, Volos directed the hero to use him for \nresurrection magic: "Open my body, take out my entrails, rub the dead \nman with my blood." H This was supposed to restore life to the dead. \n\nVolos was still incarnated in a ritually castrated and slaughtered \nstallion every spring, up to the 18th century a.d. 15 Since the people \ninsisted on worshipping him, he was converted into a Christian saint, \nVlas, who had no real existence except as a pagan horse-god. \n\nAncient Rome knew him as the October Horse, or curtus equus \n("cut horse"). By an elaborate ritual, the animal was divided into \nthree sections by sacred women known as the Three Queens. After \nslaughtering, the horse\'s amputated tail was carried hastily to the \ntemple of Vesta the earth\'s yoni, by Roman reckoning so its bloo \ncould drip on the altar. 16 In earlier times it probably was the horse\'s \npenis that donated its blood to the Goddess, as in the rites of Saranyu I \nand Volsi. Castrated stallions were offered to all equine forms of the \nGoddess. The Taurians sacrificed to Artemis horses from whom "the j \nmember was cut off." I7 \n\nThe blood-wedding of the Earth Mother and the Horse\'s Penis \nproduced the race of horse-gods known in the Aegean as centaurs, in \nIndia as Asvins or Gandharvas. 18 They were great wizards, skilled in \nmusic and dancing, expert healers, lusty lovers of women. They often \nstole brides from their bridegrooms, a legend reminiscent of the ancien \n\n\n\n412 \n\n\n\nDriental custom of having brides deflowered by priests or god-penises Horse \n\nnstead of by their husbands (see Firstborn). 19 \n\nWestern centaurs were similar, born of Mare-headed Demeter in ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nMycenae, or of Leukippe the White Mare in Crete. 20 Priests of this \ngoddess were castrated and wore female dress. 21 Sometimes they were \nailed Magnetes, "Great Ones." One of their leaders was the magic \nlorse Arion, born of Demeter\'s union as a mare with the sea god in the \n: orm of a stallion. 22 A sacred grove in Chios called Tripotamara \n"Three Streams) is said to be still haunted by ghostly centaur-wizards. 23 \n\nGreeks called Corinthian horse-priestesses "man-eating mares," \nilso known as the horse-masked Pegae guarding the sacred fountain \njf Pirene, home of Pegasus another name for Arion, the horse who \n:arried heroes to heaven. The Pegae-priestesses killed Bellerophon \nmd his father, a typical father-son combination of the reborn deity. \nDiodorus compared the orgies of the Pegae to those of the Egyptian \n>ull-god Apis, whose priestesses tore him apart and directed his spurting \nJood onto their genitals to fertilize themselves on behalf of their \nGoddess, the ea>th. 24 \n\nCustoms of the Cretan horse cult produced the myth of Hippoly- \ntus (He Who is Torn by Horses), dragged to death by his chariot \nporses after receiving a curse from his father Theseus. The myth \nconcealed a primitive sacrifice, though Hippolytus was eventually \ncanonized as a Christian saint. 25 In his Christian form, Hippolytus was \nBragged to death by horses on the Goddess\'s holy day in August. 26 \nborne said Demeter\'s Cretan lover Iasion was similarly torn to pieces by \nnorses. 27 \n\nAncient kings of Sweden were torn to pieces by horse- Valkyries or \nlorse-masked priestesses of Freya, known as volvas. 28 Medieval \nolklore redefined a volva as a witch able to transform herself into a \nnare. She embodied the spirit of the Scandinavian death-goddess \nvho rode a winged black horse known as the Valraven (Raven-ridden- \ny- Valkyries). 29 Slavs used to pray to her as the virgin battle-queen \nDiana, Athene, Bellona, etc.) before setting forth to war: "Unsheathe, \np Virgin, the sacred sword of thy father, take up the breastplate of \ntiy ancestors, thy doughty helmet, bring out thy black horse." 30 \n\nThe myth of King Midas and his ass-ears was dressed in Celtic \nhrb for transposition to an Irish horse cult centering on King Lavra \np. 3rd century a.d.). The king was said to have horse\'s ears, a fact \nmown only to his barber until the barber whispered the secret to a \nJ/illow tree. The willow was cut down and made into a harp, and the \nlarp sang the truth about the king\'s ears. 31 \n\nHorse sacrifices were performed in Norway in the 10th century \nLd. despite the efforts of newly converted Christian kings to discon- \n\nInue them. King Haakon\'s rebellious subjects not only continued the \nagan feasts of horsemeat but forced the king himself to take part in \n\n\n\n413 \n\n\n\nHorse! them and drink toasts to the old gods meanwhile. 32 \n\nHorseshoe Traces of the horse sacrifice persisted in England up to the 16th \n\n^^^^^^^^ m ^ m century, when it was still customary for all horses to be bled on St. \n\nStephen\'s Day, the day after Christmas, for "luck." " The New Year \nsacrifice of a white horse-image known as Old Hob was the same \n"hobby-horse" as Germany\'s Schimmel, made of a horse head animat- \ned by young men covered by white cloths. In Pomerania the New \nYear hobby-horse performer Schimmeheiter pantomimed ancient sacri- \nficial dances. 34 Christian opposition to pagan horse sacrifices probably \ngave rise to the strong prejudice against eating horsemeat. 35 \n\nI.

Her many lovers included Tannhauser in Germany and \nThomas Rhymer (Thomas of Ercel\'s Down) in England. Accord- \ning to the Thuringian Chronicle, she appeared as a fiery trinity in 1 398, \nas "three great fires in the air" descending to rest in the Horselberg. 1 \nEventually the Goddess Horsel was canonized as the apocryphal St. \nUrsula, with her "eleven thousand virgins" transformations of the \nMoon-mother and her daughter stars. \n1. Baring-Gould, C.M.M.A., 211. \n\n\n\nHorseshoe \n\nHindus, Arabs, and Celts regarded the yonic shape of the horseshoe \nas a symbol of the Goddess\'s "Great Gate," thus it was always esteemed \nas a prophylactic door charm. Druidic temples were constructed in \nthe shape of a horseshoe. 1 So were some Hindu temples, with the frank \nintention of representing the yoni. The horseshoe arch of Arabic \nsacred architecture developed from the same tradition. 2 \n\nGreeks assigned the yonic shape to the last letter of their sacred \nalphabet, Omega, literally, "Great Om," the Word of Creation \nbeginning the next cycle of becoming. The implication of the horseshoe \nsymbol was that, having entered the yonic Door at the end of life \n(Omega), man would be reborn as a new child (Alpha) through the \n\n\n\n414 \n\n\n\nsame Door. It was everywhere represented as "a horseshoe, the very Hortus Conclusus \n\nfigure that is nailed to so many doors in various parts of the world, as an Horus \n\nemblem of luck. Mighty few of those who live in such houses know ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthat the horseshoe is only a symbol of the yoni and that by nailing it to \ntheir doors, they follow out a custom older than the history of their \nrace." 3 \n\nThe Christian God who claimed to be the "Alpha and Omega" \n(Revelation 1:8) was only copying one version of this very ancient \nsymbolism, whose meaning seems not to have been understood by the \nbiblical writer. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 315-16. 2. de Lys, 113. 3. Goldberg, 102. \n\n\n\nHortus Conclusus \n\n"Enclosed Garden," a symbol of the Virgin, whose garden was called \nParadise and mythologically related to the womb. Virginity meant the \nfeminine "gate of paradise" was not yet opened. In the erotic \nmetaphors of Solomon\'s wedding song, the virgin bride as yet un- \ndeflowered is not only a hortus conclusus but "a spring shut up, a \nfountain sealed" (Song of Solomon 4:12). In medieval art, the virgin \nMary was mystically depicted inside a walled garden representing her \nvirginity. 1 \n\n1. Hughes, 55. \n\n\n\nHorus \n\nEgyptian Divine Child, or reborn sun; a son-reincarnation of either \nRa or Osiris, or both. Horus was depicted as a child with a long lock of \nnair curled to one side of his head and a finger in his mouth, signifying \n:hildlike dependence. 1 Yet he was also a warrior, avenging his \nfather" or elder-self Osiris by castrating and killing Set, the god of the \nbarren half of the year. \n\nSome said there was a Horus the Elder, born of Isis immediately \nifter her own birth, for he was conceived by the coupling of Isis and \nler twin-brother-spouse Osiris while they were still in the womb of their \nnother Mut. Other myths said Horus was the world\'s firstborn sun, \nvho arose from the primal Mother\'s lotus-yoni at the beginning of \nime. 2 \n\nHorus might be traced to the Far East, as the "Lotus-born" \nperuka, or hero; the original Egyptian form of his name was Hem. \nJreek Gnostics of the philosophical age called him Harpocrates. What- \nver his name, he was another variation on the usual theme of the \nying-and-reborn god, father-killing son and son-killing father. \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 1, 484. 2.

Bread \nplayed "host" to the visiting spirit of the deity, and became one with \nthe body of the worshipper upon being eaten. See Cannibalism; \nTransubstantiation. Another derivative of hostia was "hostage," a \nsurrogate; and if not ransomed, a victim. \n\n\n\nHouri \n\nPersian-Arabian heavenly nymph, sexual angel, or temple prostitute; \ncognate with the Greek hora, Babylonian harine, Semitic harlot, or \n"whore." Houris were dancing "Ladies of the Hour" who kept time \nin heaven and tended the star-souls. See Angel; Prostitution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHsi Wang Mu \n\n"Lady-Queen of the West," Chinese Great Mother who kept the \nfruit of immortality in a magic orchard in the Far West, as did Idun, \nPomona, Hera, Morgan, etc. Instead of apples, Hsi Wang Mu raised \npeaches, the Chinese symbol of the yoni. Once every 3000 years she \ngave the gods peaches from her Tree of Life. \' See Peach. \n\n1. Larousse, 382. \n\n\n\nHubris \n\nGreek "lechery," or "pride," both words associated with penile \nerection; said to be the sin of Lucifer. Patriarchal gods especially \npunished hubris, the sin of any upstart who became in both \nsenses "too big for his breeches." \' \n\nThe original Hubristika was an Argive "Feast of Lechery" featur- \ning orgies and transvestism. Men broke a specific taboo by wearing \nwomen\'s veils and assuming women\'s magic power. 2 Christianity later \ncondemned as devil-worship all forms of transvestism, because of its \nimplication that men acquired power through connection with women, \nwhether it was a sexual connection or a masquerade. \n\nFrom hubrizein, lecherous behavior, came the Roman word \nhybrid, describing a child of a Roman father and a foreign mother. A \ntrace of the old law of matrilineal inheritance dictated that a child was a \nslave or a freeman according to the status of his mother, slave or free; \nthe father\'s status was irrelevant. Similarly among the Jews, in the case \n\n\n\n416 \n\n\n\nof mixed marriages or hybridization, a child was Jewish only if the \nTiother was the Jewish parent, but gentile if only the father was Jewish. 3 \n\n1.

All \n\nhe savior-gods in these cults were castrated. See Castration; \n\nTransvestism. \n\nl.Gaster,317. \n\n\n\n-luppah \n\niebrew "tent," the marriage canopy held above the heads of a bride \nnd groom in a Jewish wedding, a custom derived from the ancient \ntemitic matriarchate when women owned their tents, and a wedding \neremony was in effect a solemnization of the man\'s permission to enter \nle tent of his beloved. 1 The tent and the land it occupied were \nembolic of the woman herself. Before the development of patriarchal \nJes, she had complete control of her property. An Arabian wife \nould divorce her husband without speaking a word, simply by turning \ner tent to face the other direction, which let him know he was \n>rbidden to enter the door again. 2 \n\nWhen Absalom tried to establish a right to rule Israel, he raised \nan awning on a housetop" and beneath its shade he copulated with \n!ing David\'s royal concubines "in the sight of all Israel" (2 Samuel \n6:22). Without this rite of sacred marriage, no man could be a king, \nbsalom\'s followers erected the customary phallic pillar in his name, to \nanor his virility after he died as a surrogate for the king (2 Samuel \n8:18). \n\nThe huppah was not unknown as an accompaniment to Gentile \ncarriages. Anglo-Saxon weddings similarly took place "under a veil \n\' square piece of cloth, held at each corner by a tall man, over the \nidegroom and bride." 4 The veil seems to have symbolized the \nOman\'s dwelling place, for early Anglo-Saxon marriages were \natrilocal. \n\n: 1 .

Mar- \nriage with the queen \ngave him formal \nright to rule her land, \nand the senti like the \nhuppah was a symbol of \npermission. 5 \n\n\n\n417 \n\n\n\nHusband property rights were matrilineal. A husband was not considered an \n\nintegral part of the maternal clan but remained a "stranger" in the \n^^^^^^^^^^ house, as in early Greece where the men\'s god Zeus was "god of \nstrangers." \' \n\nPre-Islamic Arabian husbands didn\'t even have names in the \nmatrilineal clan until they begot children; then a man could call \nhimself abu, "father of. . ." So-and-so. This part of an Arab\'s name is \nstill considered the most important part. 2 \n\nIn southeast India, a husband was regarded as a more or less \npermanent guest in the wife\'s home, constrained to remain on his \ngood behavior according to the rules governing guests. In archaic Japan, \nhusbands were not residents in the wife\'s home at all, but only \nvisitors. The old word for "marriage" meant "to slip into the house by \nnight." 5 Patrilocal marriage was unknown in Japan until 1400 a.d. 4 \n\nThe position of a husband in the ancient world was often tempo- \nrary, subject to summary divorce. An Arabian wife could dismiss her \nhusband by turning her tent to face the west for three nights in \nsuccession. 5 After the introduction of Islamic patriarchy, the system \nwas reversed in favor of men. A husband could turn his wife out of her \nhome simply by saying "I divorce thee" three times. \n\nEarly Latin tribes followed the same rules as Arabians; a woman \ncould divorce her husband by shutting him out of her house for three \nconsecutive nights. 6 Even in imperial times, a Roman wife could \nmaintain her own property free of husbandly claims by passing three \nnights of each year away from his residence. 7 \n\nAncient Egypt had several varieties of marriage existing side by \nside. Some, probably the oldest, were governed by premarital agree- \nments that spelled out the wife\'s property rights and the husband\'s \ncomparative powerlessness under the law. For example: \n\n/ bow before thy rights as a wife. From this day on, I shall never oppose \nthy claims with a single word. I recognize thee before all others as my \nwife, though I do not have the right to say thou must be my wife. Only I \nam thy husband and mate. Thou alone hast the right of departure. \nFrom this day on that I have become thy husband, I cannot oppose thy \nwish, wherever thou desirest to go. ... I have no power to interfere in \nany of thy transactions. I hereby cede to thee any rights deeded to me in \nany document that has been made out in my favor. Thou keepest me \nobligated to recognize all these cessions. 8 \n\nEgyptian priests advised husbands to remain in their wives\' good I \ngraces, much as Christian priests later advised wives to make themselves! \nsubservient to husbands: \n\nKeep thy house, love thy wife, and do not dispute with her. She will \nwithdraw herself before violence. Feed her, adorn her, massage her. \nCaress her and make her heart to rejoice as long as thou livest. . . . Attend] \nto that which is her desire and to that which occupies her mind. For in \nsuch manner thou persuadest her to remain with thee. If thou opposest \nher, it will be thy ruin. 9 \n\n\n\n418 \n\n\n\nAn Egyptian husband was counseled to make glad his wife\'s Hvov \n\nheart "during the time that thou hast," which might have meant a Hyacinthus \n\nlifetime on earth, or else a shorter period implying a temporary ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmarriage. 10 In the matrilocal household, husbands often entered a \nperiod of trial servitude to win their brides, as did the biblical Jacob to \nwin the hand of Rachel (Genesis 29). Hence Sophocles\'s remark that \n"Egyptian men sit indoors all day long, weaving; the women go out \nand attend to business." n \n\nSimilarly among Anglo-Saxon tribes, "husbandry" meant farm \nwork as it still does because a husband was usually bonded to \nwork on his wife\'s land. Such an agricultural matriarchate is still found \nin some areas. Among the Zuni, husbands worked in the fields, but \nthe land and its harvest belonged to their wives. 12 The old custom of \nproviding work in compensation for marriage gave rise to the word \nbridegroom, literally "the bride\'s servant." The Koran tells men, "your \nwives are your tillage," because by ancient Arabian law a wifeless \nman was also landless. 13 See Matrilineal Inheritance. \n\nTantric sages considered "husbandship" (bhavanan) essential for \nstill another reason: it was indispensable to a man\'s spiritual develop- \nment. The same notion was found among Aryan Celts. The ancient \nIrish said a true bard could have power over poetry and magic only if \nhe had "purity of husbandship," that is, fidelity to his wife. 14 \n\n1. J.E. Harrison, 519. 2.

By making judicious gifts to civil authorities, \nCyril and his monks managed to halt official investigation of Hypa- \ntia\'s murder. 1 Cyril attained sainthood in 1882 when Pope Leo XIII \ncanonized him as a "doctor of the church." 2 \n\nHypatia\'s teachings had been famous throughout the land of \nEgypt, and her death signaled the end of pagan learning in that \ncountry. 3 \n\n1.

Her \n"ideas" were like personal Muses, "which forms she did in the \nHeavens above the Stars frame to herself." \' \n\nMedieval theologians disliked the Idea\'s feminine connotations \nand turned away from the ancient theory of the eide to the astral \ntheology of Aristotle, that is, to astrological determination of thoughts. 2 \nFeminine "idea" was replaced by masculine "concept," which used \nto mean the same as conception, from Latin concipere semina, a \ngathering-up of semen. 3 \n\nEarly Christian Gnostics however regarded God the Creator as a \nmere demiurge, child of the Mother who created in his mind all the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n424 \n\n\n\n"ideas" he used to make things in the material world. His sin was that he \narrogantly claimed all these ideas to be his own, because "he was \nignorant of the ideas of whatever he created and of the Mother \nherself." 4 This notion that God was guilty of the sin of hubris against \nthe Goddess recurred again and again among early Gnostic sects, until \nthe orthodox church declared the notion heretical and forcibly \nchanged the minds of its adherents. \n\nl.Agrippa,65. 2.

Jonas, 191. \n\n\n\nIdolatry \n\n\n\nIdolatry \n\nThe pagan habit of making graven images of deities and heroes was \ncopied by the Catholic church and never abandoned, despite God\'s \nmany prohibitions of idolatry in the Bible (Exodus 20:4, Leviticus \n19:4, etc.). St. Thomas Aquinas defended the church against the \nbiblical tradition, and laid down a rule that the same reverence must \nbe paid to Christ\'s image as to the deity himself. 1 \n\nThe issue of idolatry became crucial in the Protestant Reforma- \ntion, when heretic sects broke off from Catholicism, claiming that \npapal Rome no longer followed the biblical magisterium in this matter \nor any other. \n\nJohn Wyclif declared that holy images were of no use except as \nfirewood. For this reason, among others, the church insisted on \ndigging up his heretic bones 30 years after his death and burning them. 2 \n\nSome Protestant sects, like the Socinians, argued that if Catholics \ncould be saved despite their disobedience of God\'s clear command \nagainst idolatry, then Protestants could be saved also, though they \ndenied other papal doctrines such as the trinity and the eternity of \ndamnation. In renouncing idolatry, they claimed to be following the \nletter of biblical law more closely than the Roman church did. 3 \n\nOne reason for renunciation of idols was the fear that people \nwould cease to be suitably impressed by them, for after the decline of \nRoman culture holy images became less and less impressive. Lacking \nthe artistic skill and training that had flourished under paganism, \nChristian image-makers were unable to produce anything comparable \nto the classical sculptures and paintings. They created only the \ncrudest sort of painted wooden figures or icons. 4 \n\nImages, no matter how venerable, failed to arouse the proper \nreverence when their cracks showed, their paint chipped, or the \nawkward technique of a mediocre artist too obviously proclaimed a \nman-made artifact devoid of inspiration. As the Chinese proverb said, \nNo image-maker worships the gods he knows what stuff they are \nmade of." 5 So did everyone else know, in the case of crudely \n:nceived idols. Some, however, succeeded in fooling the credulous \nfaithful for a long time. Boxley Monastery near Maidstone attracted \n\n\n\nJohn Wyclif (ca. \n1330-1384) English \nreforming theologian \nwho inspired John \nHuss, the Lollards, \nand other leaders of the \nProtestant \n\nReformation. Wyclif \nserved as rector of \nFillingham, prebend of \nAust, warden of \nCanterbury, and rector \nof Ludgershall in \nBuckinghamshire. \n\n\n\n425 \n\n\n\nIdolatry many pilgrimages to its famous Rood of Grace, an idol of Christ that \n\ncould "come alive": its eyes and lips moved. Cromwell\'s officers \n^^^^^^^^^^ m disclosed the deception in 1 536, publicly displaying the wires and rods \ninside the statue that created the "miracle." 6 \n\nSimilarly "miraculous" idols, in effect, were the many pagan tomb- \ncarvings and statues taken over by Christian churches and \nre-christened martyrs and saints. Where pagan folk were used to visiting \nshrines of heroes and demigods for petitions or healing, churches \nsimply moved into the shrine and created a new tale of martyrdom for \nan old god, using his faked "relics" for healing magic. Especially with \nmedieval monks, "the manufacture of martyrs became a thriving indus- \ntry." Even the bones of ordinary Roman citizens dug out of ancient \ntombs or catacombs became "idols" in that they were worshipped as \ndivine containers for the spirits of saints. 7 This kind of idolatry was \nnot a new Christian invention, but a copy of pagan practice. The \nwritings of Pliny show magical recipes in classical times using the \nrelics of slain gladiators, or hair, or pieces of garments, or nails from a \ncross on which a man had been executed. 8 \n\nThe Catholic church changed its collective mind several times \nabout idols before settling down to permit them. Certainly early sects, \nsuch as the Iconoclasts, adopted a typically Semitic horror of idols and \ndevoted themselves to smashing every metal or marble god or \ngoddess. At the Council of Constantinople, the bishops unanimously \ndecreed that images were inventions of the devil and must be kept \nout of Christian churches. Three decades later, the Council of Nicaea \nreversed this decision and even anathematized those who refused to \nworship images. Two more councils contradicted each other\'s decisions \non the matter, until in 843 the images were reinstated in the churches \nonce for all. 9 \n\nOne way in which the church excused its own idolatry was to \nclaim that its idols were not real idols but only "symbols." Whatever \nthis may have meant, the churchmen knew perfectly well that the \naverage worshipper made no such distinction. The images were as \nthoroughly idolized as any African fetish or Phidian Athene: \n\nThe instant we ascribe to an image . . . real power to act, we make of it an \n\ninspired being in itself, and all the sophistry in the world as to its being a \n\nmeans of faith, or a symbol, or causing a higher power to act on the \n\nsuppliant, is rubbish. The devotee believes tout bonnement that the \n\nimage works the cure, and if he did not, any other image of the Virgin or \n\nSaint would answer the same purpose. This chaff has been thrashed out \n\na thousand times. . . . And it will last, while one fetish endures, that the \n\nhierophant will call it a mere "symbol, " and the ignorant worshipper, \n\nabsolutely unable to comprehend him, will worship the symbol as the \n\nthing itself as he is really expected to do. w \n\n1.

Hyde, 61, 77. \n\n\n\nImmaculate Conception \n\nOften erroneously thought to refer to the conception of Christ, the \ndoctrine of the Immaculate Conception actually was invented to absolve \nthe virgin Mary of original sin from the moment of her own \nconception. Early fathers of the church said Mary couldn\'t be Theoto- \nkos (God-bearer) if she was human, therefore tainted with the sin of \n\n\n\n427 \n\n\n\nImmanuel \n\nInanna \n\n\n\nEve; it was heresy to worship her as divine. 1 Nevertheless, people \ninsisted on worshipping her. 2 By the 1 2th century, Mariolatry even \novershadowed the worship of God and Christ; so the doctrine of the \nImmaculate Conception was invented to make her uniquely holy. \n\nMany churchmen opposed the doctrine, which was heatedly \nargued for the next 700 years. Finally it was adopted as an article of \nfaith by Pope Pius IX in 1854. 3 Every Catholic was commanded to \nbelieve henceforth that Mary "at the first instant of her conception, \nwas preserved immaculate from all stain of original sin, by the singular \ngrace and privilege granted to her by Almighty God." 4 \n\nA certain unnamed medieval holy man had been informed by a \ndivine source that Mary\'s birthday was September 8, precisely nine \nmonths after the December festival which originally represented the \nconception of the Virgin Goddess Kore. 5 Apparently the date was \nchosen to celebrate Epiphany and the Immaculate Conception at the \nsame time. \n\nThese events being equally devoid of documentation, their inven- \ntion and promulgation sometimes aroused scorn among \nnon-Catholics. Hazlitt scoffed: "We hear of her immaculate conception \nas an afterthought, on the part of the Romanists. . . . [T]he whole \nnarrative touching her [Mary] is evidently fabulous, and . . . the immac- \nulate conception by her mother, her own purification ... are \nabsurdities." 6 \n\nHow Mary\'s conception took place was a problem that aroused \nsome ingenious theological nonsense. Mary\'s father was not God or a \nspirit but a living man, and if he had sexual intercourse with Mary\'s \nmother it would mean using the medium of transmission of original \nsin, by the church\'s own teaching. Some theologians would have it that \nhis seed was carried magically, as if he were an incubus. \n\nl.deRiencourt, 150. 2. Daly, 92. 3. Young, 203. 4. Encyc. Brit., "Mary." \n5. de Voragine, 524. 6.

Wedding hymns for the hieros gamos said, "Oh \n\n\n\n428 \n\n\n\nmy queen, queen of the universe, the queen who encompasses the Incest \nuniverse, may he [the king] enjoy long days at your holy lap." Some- \ntimes she turned her power against the king\'s enemies: "My queen, _^_^__^_^__ \nthe foreign lands cower at your cry My queen, you are all-devour- \ning in your power My queen, the great gods fled before you like \n\nfluttering bats." Tradition said the city of Agade was completely \ndestroyed because Inanna abandoned its temple: "Holy Inanna \nforsook the shrine Agade . . . ; she went forth against the city in battle." \' \n\nInanna was the source of the earth\'s life blood. She filled the wells, \nrivers, and springs with her "blood." As a fertility deity, like her \nBabylonian counterpart Ishtar, she annually descended into the under- \nworld to rescue her consort Dumuzi [Tammuz]. As Nanna, Nana, or \nAnna she became the holy virgin mother of Attis, the bride of Balder, \nand the elder Virgin Mother whom Christians called "God\'s \nGrandmother." 2 \n\nHittites called her Inaras. In the land of Hatti she renewed her \nvirginity each year to become the bride of the sacred king at the Purulli \nfestival, which later passed into the Jewish Purim. The chosen man was \nisolated in a royal castle or tower, and slain at the appointed time so his \nblood would help the Goddess fertilize the land. Certain writings of \nlamentation suggest that the king-martyr regretted his brief glory. 3 \n\n1. Pritchard, A.N.E., 127, 202, 207. 2. Graves, W.G., 411. 3.

His mother-marrying, father-killing legend arose \nnot from a wish-fulfillment fantasy but from the ancient system of \nsuccession of sacred kings, whereby every previous king was slain by his \nsuccessor, chosen to be the queen\'s new bridegroom. The killer was \nalways described as a "son" of the deceased because he was the same \ngod reincarnated in another consort of the same mother-bride. Such \nsacred incest can still be traced even in the Christian image of the divine \nSon who is indistinguishable from his Father, who impregnated his \nown Mother (i.e., Mother of God) to beget himself. \n\nWhen patriarchal invaders overthrew the Theban matriarchate, \nthey purposely misinterpreted the sacred icons that told the story of \nits royal succession. The name of the deceased "father," Laius, simply \nmeant "King," and that of the widowed "mother" was the same as \nthe title of the Moon Goddess. The replacement, Oedipus, was depict- \ned as a stranger from a distant land. To make him the king\'s true son, \nimprobable details were added to show he was sent away in infancy and \nbrought up among foreigners. Freud\'s rather subjective notion that \nall men secretly want to kill their fathers the so-called Oedipus \ncomplex may have had more to do with Freud\'s own experience of \na repressive father than with any mythic archetype. 1 \n\n\n\n429 \n\n\n\nIncest Sacred incest between father-son and mother-bride was usual \n\namong ancient god-kings. It was considered necessary for the god- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ dess-queen to be periodically supplied with a young, virile consort who \nembodied the same god again as the older consort. Thus Egyptian \ngods like Amon and Osiris were respectfully entitled, "Husband of thy \nmother." 2 The reborn Savior appeared as Min, or Menu, the Moon- \nbull who mated with his sacred Cow-mother. In human form, he was \nshown with an abnormally long erect phallus, as an ithyphallic sex \ngod like Eros or Kama, the Bull "from whom spring the delights of \nlove." 3 \n\nThroughout Egypt generally the company of gods of a town or city were \nthree in number . . . ; two members of such a triad were gods, one old \nand one young, and the third was a goddess, who was, naturally, the wife, \nor female counterpart, of the older god. The younger god was the son \nof the older god and goddess, and he was supposed to possess all the \nattributes and powers which belonged to his father. . . . [I]t was as- \nsumed that he would succeed to his rank and throne when the older god \nhad passed away. * \n\nHere was the basis of trinities consisting of Father, Son, and \nHoly Spirit (or, Goddess: the third member of the trinity was female, as \nshe was even in Gnostic Christianity under the name of Sophia). The \nsame trinity occurs in almost all mythologies, without ever developing \ninto a complete family: there is no daughter, only a son. That is, man- \nas-youth and man-as-man have their separate projections into divinity; \nbut woman is always the same. \n\nUnlike Freud, Jung said the meaning of the mother-son incest in \nreligions was not based on simple eroticism but on the idea of rebirth. \n"To get back to the mother again in order to be born again by the \nmother. . . . One of the simplest ways was to fructify the mother and \nprocreate oneself again. ... It is not incestuous cohabitation that is \nsought, but rebirth. . . . The neurotic who cannot leave his mother \nhas good reason; fear of death holds him there. It appears that there is \nno concept and no word strong enough to express the meaning of \nthis conflict. Whole religions are built to give value to the magnitude of \nthis conflict." 5 \n\nThough the myth of Oedipus was not about true "Oedipal" \nfather-son rivalry but rather about sacred kingship, the theme of male \njealousy was amply demonstrated elsewhere in myths. Rank says, "It is \nnot necessary to explore the heavens for some process into which this \ntrait might be laboriously fitted . . . ; in reality, a certain tension is \nfrequently, if not regularly, revealed between father and son . . . \nrelated to the competition for the tender devotion and love of the \nmother." 6 It might be a fruitful avenue for psychological investiga- \ntion to determine why mother-son love in mythology was nearly always \ntransmuted into the realm of the erotic. \n\n1.

Greeks \npracticed incubation especially in the healing temples of Asclepius and \nHygeia. Egyptians\' favorite incubus appeared in temples of Imhotep. 1 \nUndoubtedly, the appearance of the incubus was often carefully staged, \nwhen the sleeper was a figure of political importance, to issue the \n"right" prophecies and advice that would benefit the temple. \n\nChristians copied the custom of incubation, which became \n"watching" or "keeping vigil." It was recommended in a time of \ntroublesome decision to "watch and pray" overnight in a church, to \ncourt a vision of guidance. The incubus, however, was diabolized. He \nwas no longer the same as a guiding angel. The reason for his fall from \ngrace was the ancient tradition of midnight sexual relationships between \nincubating women and priests, or incubating men and priestesses. \nIncubi thus became spirits of lust. \n\nCertain churchmen said incubi were demon lovers of women, able \nto beget children in a demonic version of the Virgin Birth. Father \nLudovico Sinistrari said hedging his bets like every well-trained cler- \nic "Subject to correction by our Holy Mother Church, and as a mere \nexpression of private opinion, I say that the Incubus, when having \nintercourse with a woman, begets the human fetus from his own seed." \nAs a "well-known" example of a demon-begotten man, Sinistrari cited \n"that damnable heresiarch Martin Luther." 2 As for the opinion of the \ndamnable heresiarch himself, Luther said all odd-looking children \nshould be destroyed at birth, for they were clearly the offspring of \ndemons. 3 \n\nOther authorities, like St. Thomas Aquinas, insisted that demons \nmust be sterile. Therefore an incubus could impregnate a woman only \nby carrying semen from a man with whom the demon previously \ncopulated in the form of a succubus or she-demon for demons were \nthought to change their sex at will. 4 Aquinas also asserted that a demon \ncould use semen lost in a wet dream so a man could be "at one and the \nsame time both a virgin and a father." 5 \n\nHere Aquinas contradicted both the biblical tradition and \nSt. Augustine, who cited Genesis 6:4 to prove that fallen angels begot \nchildren on mortal women: "The sons of God came in unto the \ndaughters of men, and they bare children to them." Pope Benedict XIV \nannounced, "This passage has reference to devils known as incubi and \nsuccubi." The pope declined to decide the question of demonic \nconception, however; he simply mentioned both schools of thought: \n"Some writers deny that there can be offspring. . . . Others, however, \nasserting that coitus is possible, maintain that children may result." On \nthis theory, a woman was burned at Carcassonne in 1275 for bearing a \nchild to the devil. 6 \n\nChurchmen with some classical education pointed out that the \n\n\n\nIncubus \n\n\n\nLudovico Maria \nSinistrari 18th- \ncentury Franciscan \ntheologian, author of \nDemonality. \n\n\n\n431 \n\n\n\nIncubus \n\n\n\nPierre de Lancre \n\n(1553-1601) Trial judge \nfor the Inquisition, \nwho boasted of burning \nhundreds of witches \nand charged the entire \npopulation of Pays \nde Labourd some \n30,000 persons \nwith witchcraft. He \nwrote several books \non witchcraft, which \nwere accepted as \nauthoritative. \n\n\n\ngods of the heathen devils, by the church\'s definition were fa- \nthers. 7 Many legends accepted by the church attributed demonic \nparentage to such historical figures as Robert of Normandy, Alexan- \nder the Great, Plato, Scipio Africanus, all the Huns, and all the \nCypriots. 8 A 6th-century History of the Goths declared that the Huns \nwere descended from the offspring of women and incubi. 9 Neverthe- \nless, the opinion of Aquinas generally overruled both classical and \nbiblical precedent. \n\nWhatever the incubus\'s reproductive potential, his sexual capacity \ninspired ill-concealed male envy in an age when nearly all men were \nso sexually naive as to confuse penis size with lovemaking skills. Father \nSinistrari said women who lay with incubi found afterward that the \nlovemaking of mere men was "paltry and unable to arouse them to any \ndegree." 10 Pico della Mirandola explained why: incubi were hand- \nsome and notable for "the extraordinary largeness of their members. . . . \nThe devils can even agitate the thing when it is inside, wherefore the \nwomen derive more pleasure than they do with men." De Lancre \nquoted the testimony of an accused witch, who said her devil "had a \nmember like a mule\'s ... as long and as thick as an arm. ... He always \nexposed his instrument, of such beautiful shape and measurements." \nDespite these unwieldy proportions, incubi were said to seduce very \nyoung children. The Chancellor of Wiirzburg declared in August, \n1629, that "There are some 300 children of three or four years who \nhave had intercourse with devils." \' \' \n\nSatyrs, fauns, and the Gaulish dusii (from deus, "god") were cited \nin an official Inquisition handbook as incubi who had intercourse with \nwitches in front of witnesses. St. Augustine called the Gaulish Dusius \nan incubus who lay with mortal women; and later churchmen \nearnestly supported Augustine with what they conceived to be proof. 12 \nWomen seemed unaccountably willing to copulate with their de- \nmons under the eyes of "bystanders"; the latter reported that, while the \ndemon remained invisible, "it has been apparent from the disposition \nof those limbs and members which pertain to the venereal act and \norgasm, [that] . . . they have been copulating with Incubus devils." B \n\nNuns appeared especially vulnerable to the attentions of incubi. 14 \nAuthorities said nuns often awoke in the morning "to find themselves \npolluted as if they had slept with men." 15 Some nuns claimed they slept \nwith Christ, but this was condemned as blasphemy resulting from \ndemonic possession, even though the church taught them to think of \nthemselves as Christ\'s wives. \n\nThere were some Christian saints who functioned as incubi \nthemselves. At shrines of St. Giles in Normandy and St. Rene in \nAnjou, women would lie all night with the saints\' ithyphallic images \nhoping to conceive children. 16 Christians used to incubate in the \ntemple of Isis at Canopis, following local custom; so the bishops moved \nsome bones into the temple and called them relics of two martyrs, \nCyrus of Alexandria and John of Edessa. Incubations continued as \n\n\n\n432 \n\n\n\nbefore, and any subsequent miracles were credited to the martyrs Indulgence \n\ninstead of to Isis. 17 \n\nOn occasion, women who consorted with incubi seemed to inspire ^^^^^^^^^^ \nmore fear than the demons themselves. An Anglo-Saxon Leechbook \nprescribed magic salves for protection, not against incubi but against \n"women with whom the Devil had sexual intercourse." At Toulouse \nin 1275, a 56-year-old woman of means was robbed of her worldly \ngoods by ecclesiastical confiscation, and tortured until she confessed \nthat she had intercourse with an incubus every night for years and gave \nbirth to the demon\'s child, which was half wolf and half snake. 18 \n\nPerhaps the ultimate irony was the church\'s official opinion that all \n\nthe activities of incubi were performed "with the permission of \n\nGod." 19 But what God allowed, men punished. \n\n1.

By \nselling indulgence, the church reaped enormous profit with no material \ninvestment only a promise that the purchaser would be absolved of \nhis sins and admitted to heaven after death. No customer ever returned \nto complain of being cheated. \n\nIt became the rule for popes to promise plenary indulgence \n(absolute remission of all sins) to military leaders who fought the \nchurch\'s crusades. Bills of indulgence became the spiritual carrot \ncorresponding to the stick of excommunication, which was thought \nto sentence the sinner irrevocably to hellfire. \n\nBills of indulgence were peddled by Renaissance popes to earn \nmoney for their expensive lifestyle. Pope Alexander VI made a \ncommercial empire out of selling pardons. Pope Leo X sent a Domini- \ncan, Johann Tetzel, into Germany to sell indulgences for varying \nnumbers of days\' worth of release from purgatory, depending on price. \nTetzel\'s announcements read: \n\n/ have here the passports . . . to lead the human sou] into Paradise. \nInasmuch as for a single one of the mortal sins, several of which are \ncommitted every day after confession, seven years of expiation either on \nearth or in Purgatory are imposed who, for the sake of a quarter of a \nflorin, would hesitate to secure one of these letters which will admit your \ndivine, immortal soul to the celestial joys of Paradise? \' \n\nOne observer wrote in the 1 5th century: "Sinners say nowa- \nlays, I care not what or how many evils I do before God, for I can get at \nMice, without the least difficulty, plenary remission of any guilt or sin \n\n\n\n433 \n\n\n\nInfallibility whatever through an indulgence granted me by the Pope, whose \n\nwritten grant I have bought for fourpence . . . , for these grantors of \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Indulgence run about from place to place and sometimes give a letter \nfor twopence, sometimes for a good drink of wine and beer, some- \ntimes to pay their losses at a game of ball, sometimes for the hire of a \nprostitute, sometimes for fleshly love." 2 \n\nReginald Scot thought the peddling of indulgences showed the \ntrivial nature of Catholic doctrine, especially when coupled with the \nchurch\'s idolatry. He wrote of "the folly of some papists, who seeing \nand confessing the pope\'s absurd religion, in the erection and \nmaintenance of idolatry and superstition, specially in images, pardons, \nand relics of saints, will persevere to think, that the rest of his doctrine \nand trumpery is holy and good." 3 \n\nBut not all Catholics approved of the sale of indulgence. In \nPrague, papal bulls of indulgence were publicly burned at the pillory, \nhaving been carried there strung around the neck of a whore, who \nenlivened the proceedings with lascivious capering. 4 Minstrels and \nother popular entertainers throughout Europe made fun of the doctrine \nof indulgence with a satiric couplet: \n\nAs soon as the coin in the coffer rings, \nThe soul from out of the fire springs. 5 \n\nl.Chamberlin,B.P.,241. 2. Murstein, 113. 3. Scot, 12. 4. Lea unabridged, 489. \n5.Chamberlin,B.P,241. \n\n\n\nInfallibility \n\nThe doctrine of papal infallibility stated that anything the pope said \nwas invariably true, and anything he did was invariably right, because \nGod could not permit his pope to speak or act erroneously. The \ndoctrine first took shape in the 1 5 th century. It was set forth by \nimplication in the writings of Torquemada. Cardinal Cajetano openly \nproclaimed it, inspiring the pope to issue the bull Pastor eternus, which \nmade the doctrine of infallibility part of canon law. 1 \n\nIn the 19th-century Age of Enlightenment, one scientific discov- \nery after another demonstrated that the statements of popes on \nmatters like the solar system, biology, botany, geology, and other earth \nsciences to say nothing of witchcraft, diabolism, and the Bible had \nbeen patently fallible. In fact, wrong. So the church decided that the \npope was still certainly infallible but only when he spoke officially, ex \ncathedra, for then God protected his words from error if not at other \ntimes. Unfortunately this served for only a short time. It was soon \nfound that popes were wrong in numerous statements officially en- \nshrined in bulls and encyclicals. \n\nThe doctrine of infallibility had to be revised again, this time to \nstate that the pope is infallible only when speaking "on matters of \n\n\n\n434 \n\n\n\njiith and morals." Still another revision of the doctrine may be due in Infernus \n\nhe near future. Innocents \n\n1. Guignebert, 357. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n\n\nkfernus \n\nlatin word for the underworld, source of our "Inferno" which \nnplies a place of hellish fire and heat; but the Infernus was not \necessarily hot at all. The name simply meant "the place within." It \nas usually pictured as dark, not fiery. There were several entrances, \nake Avernus was one; another was the sacred cave of the Cumaean \ntfafl. \n\n\n\niheritance \n\nee Matrilineal Inheritance. \n\n\n\ninocents, Slaughter of \n\nart of the traditional myth of sacred kingship: the incumbent king is \narned by a prophecy of the birth of his future supplanter and tries to \n;cape his fate by killing numbers of recently born infants. Innocents \nere slaughtered in the myths of Sargon, Nimrod, Moses, Jason, \n(rishna, and Mordred as well as in that of Jesus. \n\nProbably the original killer of innocents was Kamsa, king of the \nhojas, who tried to kill Krishna along with a batch of other children, \nhe slaughter is depicted in the cave-temple at Elephanta, where the \nloss is the symbol of the king. 1 In this case Krishna escaped because \np was secretly exchanged with an infant girl, who was killed in his \n|ace. She grew up in heaven, and became a Goddess. She prophe- \npd that she would smash Kamsa and drink his blood; and Kamsa \n[ealized that she was his own death." 2 \n\nThe Arthurian version of the Slaughter of the Innocents followed \ne typical pagan model. Merlin predicted that Arthur would be \npthrown by a prince born on May Day, the old Celtic New Year as it \nps reckoned when kings were usually replaced by their tanists or \njons." Mordred was Arthur\'s son by his sister Margawse, therefore \npth a son and a uterine nephew, able to claim the throne by both fa- \ner-right and mother-right. Arthur seemed not to realize the obvious \nkalifications of Mordred when he ordered the slaughter of May Day \nlildren, according to Malory\'s account; and the story was further \naddled by giving the children various ages, though they were all \nbm on the same day ("some four weeks old, and some less"). 3 \n\n\n\n435 \n\n\n\nInquisition Then King Arthur let send for all the children born on May Day, \n\nbegotten of lords and born of ladies; for Merlin told King Arthur that \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ he that should destroy him should be born on May Day, where for he se, \n\nfor them all, upon pain of death; and so there were found many lords\' \nsons, and all were put in a ship to the sea, and some were four weeks oh \nand some less. And so by fortune the ship drave unto a castle, and was \nall to-riven, and destroyed the most part, save that Mordred was cast up, \nand a good man found him, and nourished him till he was fourteen \nyear old, and then he brought him to court, as it rehearseth afterward, \ntoward the end of the Death of Arthur. * \n\nThe Christian version of the slaughter of the innocents occurs \nonly in the Gospel of Matthew. Other Gospels say nothing of it. Marl \nand John make no mention of Jesus\'s early years. As far as Luke is \nconcerned, Jesus grew up quietly in Galilee after presentation in the \ntemple of Jerusalem after his birth; there was no king threatening his \nlife. Matthew\'s "slaughter" seems to have been included only to provi \nan excuse to locate the holy child in Egypt, to create fulfillment of a \nprophecy, "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (Matthew 2:1 5). \nTherefore Herod\'s attack on the children probably was invented to \nprovide a link between Jesus and his Egyptian counterpart Osiris. \n\nThe infants supposedly slain by King Herod were canonized en \nmasse, though there are no scriptural records of any of their names, \nnor even of their number. A modern Catholic scholar notes that \nenormous numbers have been postulated in the past, but "it is \nunlikely that there were more than about twenty of them at the most.\' \nYet this statement has no more foundation than a statement that \nthere were two hundred, or two thousand, or none at all perhaps tht \nmost likely possibility, since this was a universal, not a specific, myth. \n\nThe entire unknown, unnamed group became patrons of childre \nand on their feast day, December 28, it was customary in England for \nchildren to dress up and go from house to house begging gifts. \nHowever, in 1 540 an ecclesiastical proclamation ordered that this \ncustom must cease. 6 It has not been observed since. \n\n1.

Hazlitt, 131. \n\n\n\nInquisition \n\nUntil the advent of Nazism in modern Germany, Europe knew no \nsystem of organized terrorism to rival the 500-year reign of the Inquis: \ntion. Historian Henry Charles Lea, recognized as the leading expert \non the medieval period, called the Inquisition "a standing mockery of \njustice perhaps the most iniquitous that the arbitrary cruelty of man \nhas ever devised. . . . Fanatic zeal, arbitrary cruelty, and insatiable cupj \nity rivalled each other in building up a system unspeakably \natrocious. It was a system which might well seem the invention of \ndemons." (See Torture.) \n\n\n\n436 \n\n\n\nIt was invented primarily to force public acceptance of a church \n[he public didn\'t want. According to a contemporary aphorism, the \nbhurch had not ten commandments but only one: "Bring hither the \nmoney." 2 St. Bernard deplored the church\'s greed: "Whom can you \nknow me among the prelates who does not seek rather to empty the \npockets of his flock than to subdue their vices?" 3 \n\nBulgarian writers said the priests of Rome were given to drunken- \nness and robbery, and "there is none to forbid them." The local \npresbyter Cosmas didn\'t deny it but only insisted that Christians must \nhonor even wicked priests. 4 This was an accepted doctrine. Pilichdorf \nbid, "The worst man, if he be a priest, is more worthy than the holiest \npf layman." 5 \n\nPriests were a privileged class, but their privileges were more and \nbore resented. In the 12th century, monasteries made themselves \nInto wineshops and gambling houses; nunneries became private whore- \nnouses for the clergy; priests used a confessional to seduce female \nparishioners. Episcopal collectors were depicted in popular stories as the \nworst of all sinners. 6 "The sale of Church offices was constant and \nunblushing." 7 Even the pope observed that "those charged with divine \nrace . . . participate in rapine and despoliation, even in the shedding \n)f blood." 8 \n\nPierre de Bruys was burned in 1126 for declaring openly that \n\'God is no more in the church than in the market-place; the forms \n|nd ceremonies which to so many folk replace true religion are utterly \niseless; the Cross should not be prayed to. . . . The priests lie in \njretending that they made Christ\'s body and give it to the people for \nheir salvation." 9 According to Tyndale, common folk said of any- \nhing that went wrong, "the bishop has blessed it." If the dinner burned, \nhey said the bishop has put his foot in it, "because the bishops burn \nyho they list and whosoever displeaseth them." 10 \n\nWould-be reformers within the church were usually silenced, \nfrere Raymond Jean was executed for preaching against the church\'s \nIbuses. He said bitterly, "The enemies of the faith are among ourselves, \nfhe Church which governs us is symbolled by the Great Whore of \nhe Apocalypse, who persecutes the poor and the ministers of Christ." n \n\nNicholas de Clamanges, rector of the University of Paris, declared \nh an open letter that the popes were ravishers, not pastors, of their \nlocks: "The priesthood has become a misery reduced to profaning its \nailing. . . . Who do you think can endure, among so many other \npuses, your mercenary appointments, your multiple sale of benefices, \nbur elevation of men without honesty or virtue to the most eminent \nfositions?" n Pope Alexander VI, one of the men so described, was \npedited with the cynical remark, "It is not God\'s wish that a sinner \nhould die, but that he should live and pay." n \n\nA Franciscan splinter group, the Fraticelli, withdrew from their \nrder, claiming the pope and all his successors were tainted with the \nIn of simony. Therefore the church had been excommunicated by \n\n\n\nInquisition \n\n\n\nPeter von Pilichdorf \n\nAnti-heretical \nmissionary writer of \nthe early 14th century. \n\n\n\nPierre de Bruys \n\nReforming theologian \nof the 12th century, \nfounder of the heretical \nPetrobrusian sect. \n\n\n\nWilliam Tyndale \n\n(ca. 1494-1536) English \necclesiastical \nreformer, influenced by \nWyclif; translator of - \nthe first English- \nlanguage Bibles, \nmany of which were \nseized and burned by \nCatholic authorities. \nAfter a life of \npreaching and literary \nactivity which helped \nestablish the \nReformation, \nTyndale was arrested \nand executed in \nBrussels. \n\n\n\n437 \n\n\n\ninquisition \n\n\n\nWaldenses Also \ncalled Valdenses or \nVaudois, this heretic \nsect was founded in \nsouthern France \nduring the 1 2th century \nby Peter Waldo, or \nValdes, who preached a \nlife of simplicity and \npoverty in imitation of \nChrist. \n\n\n\nGod, for ignoring Christ\'s vow of poverty. They called the pope an \nAntichrist. 14 These heretics were soon exterminated. One of their \ncenters, the village of Magnalata, was leveled by order of Pope \nMartin V and every resident slain. 15 \n\nIn 1325 Pope John issued the bull Cum inter nonnullos, which \n"infallibly" declared it was heresy to say Jesus and his apostles owned \nno property. Inquisitors were ordered to prosecute those who believed \nJesus was a poor man. The group called Spiritual Franciscans, who \ndid so believe, were taught an immediate lesson when the pope had 1 14 \nof their number burned alive. 16 \n\nThe offenses of the Waldenses included many "wrong" opinions. \nThey said laymen and women had the right to preach; masses, votive \nofferings, and prayers for the dead were useless; purgatory did not exist; \none could pray to God without setting foot in a church; and a bad \npriest should be forbidden to administer sacraments "a proposition \nwhich does no less than deny lasting grace to the sacrament of \nOrders, and thus destroys the fundamental privilege of the Church." \nThe Waldenses said priests who demand money for administering \ncommunion are lower than Judas, "for they sell for one denarius that \nbody for which he demanded thirty." 17 \n\nAlong with public disgust at the church\'s avarice, there was a \ngrowing suspicion sparked by Gnostic philosophies from the east \nthat the church\'s myths of the garden of Eden, the fall, original sin, \nheaven and hell, the virgin birth, the meaning of salvation, and so on, \nwere literally untrue. Because people refused to believe the eucharistic \nbread and wine were literally flesh and blood, the papacy lost all of \nBohemia, which after many wars and crusades founded its separate \nMoravian church. Tenets of the Roman church were widely ques- \ntioned. Priests were forbidden to "dispute concerning the faith against \nsuch astute heretics" in public, lest they expose themselves to \nridicule. 18 As Becker said, "This is neurosis in a nutshell: the miscarriag< \nof clumsy lies about reality." 19 \n\nDespite the church\'s efforts to keep the populace in ignorance, \neven among the peasantry there were individuals astute enough to \nrecognize theology\'s clumsy lies. Even the 12th-century passion for \nbuilding cathedrals seems to have represented a last-ditch effort to \nhold the wandering attention of the people by giving them splendid \ntemples of the "Lady," to replace the Mother-shrines previously \ndestroyed. At length not even the Notre Dames sufficed. The Church \nhad to fall back on its traditional propensity to maintain a reign of \nterror. 20 \n\nGuignebert says Christianity was "given to warfare; exclusive, \nviolently intolerant, to the Jews especially menacing; bristling with \nperemptory dogmas which set reason at defiance; marked by complex \nelaborate rites . . . kept up to the mark by a formidable army of monks \nand kept in check by a quibbling troop of acute theologians." 21 The \nviolence of the Inquisition was its ultimate weapon. \n\n\n\n438 \n\n\n\nViolence could be invoked under this system by nothing more Inquisition \n\nhan ordinary living, just as the doctrine of original sin was invoked by \n\nlothing more than being born. Not only sexual impulses, which were ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nalways labeled corrupt, but almost every other natural impulse was \n/iewed as evidence of anti-Christian perversity. 22 \n\nModern apologists say the Inquisition served some good purposes, \nike helping secular courts bring criminals to justice. 23 Only a few \nlecades ago, even Catholic manuals mendaciously claimed the Inquisi- \nion was a purely civil tribunal. 24 Actually, the Inquisition was \nininterested in secular crimes, except insofar as they could provide a \n>asis for a charge of heresy or witchcraft. The Inquisition was created \no win the war between the church and a disillusioned public. Coulton \nays, "The so-called Ages of Faith were only Ages of Acquiescence"; \nput even the acquiescence was wearing thin. 25 \n\nThe power of the Inquisition was established and enlarged by a \nieries of papal bulls. Ad extirpanda of Pope Innocent IV, issued May \n[5, 1252, was "a terrible measure against heretics in Italy, authorizing \neizure of their goods, imprisonment, torture, and, on conviction, \nleath, all on minimal evidence." 26 \n\nThe Inquisition was the most elaborate extortion racket ever \nievised, primarily developed for profit. 27 After the arrest, the property \nif the accused was instantly confiscated. Nothing seems to have been \n^turned. The popes publicly praised the rule of confiscation as a \nbrime weapon against heresy. 28 Confiscation was the organization\'s \nhison d\'etre; when the rule of confiscation was not applied, "the \nlusiness of defending the faith languished lamentably." Affluent Italy \npade its inquisitors incredibly rich in the 14th century. Within two \nrears, the inquisitor of Florence amassed "more than seven thousand \nlorins, an enormous sum." 29 As the inquisitor Heinrich von Schulth- \njis complacently wrote, "When I have you tortured, and by the severe \nneans afforded by the law I bring you to confession, then I perform a \nLork pleasing in God\'s sight; and it profiteth me." 30 \n\nConfiscation took place before conviction, because it was taken for \nranted that no one escaped. "Officials considered themselves safe in \njcting upon the presumption" of guilt. Sometimes confiscation took \n[lace even before confession. In 1 300 a nobleman named Jean \nlaudier was arrested and first examined on January 20. He refused to \npnfess for a long time but finally was broken down by torture and \njonfessed on February 5. He was condemned on March 7. However, \nis impounded property had been sold on January 29, before the \njonfession. Similarly, Guillem Garric was arrested at Carcassonne in \n284 but not sentenced until 1319. Nevertheless, officials were \nbarreling over his castle in 1301. 31 \n\nAccused persons were expected to pay the expenses of their own \nImprisonment, even of their own torture. This continental custom \n[as followed in Scotland where, for example, torturers charged their \nictims 6 shillings and 8 pence for branding on the cheek. In \n\n\n\n439 \n\n\n\nInquisition England, accused witches were sometimes acquitted; yet they were kept \n\nin prison until they paid the expenses of their unlawful \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ imprisonment. 32 \n\nThe Inquisition\'s prisoners had to pay for their own food in prison. \nWithout money they starved. Pope Gregory XI noted that too many \nwere starving to death before they could be brought to the stake, but it \nseems not to have occurred to him to feed them on church funds. \nInstead, he offered indulgences to all who would donate food to the \n"many heretics and those defamed for heresy, who in consequence of \ntheir poverty cannot be sustained in prison unless the pious liberality of \nthe faithful shall assist them as a work of charity." Thus the church \nbent its own rules, which said anyone who helped a heretic was to be \nsuspected of heresy also. Lea commented: \n\nThere is something so appallingly grotesque in tearing honest, industrious \nfolk from their homes by the thousand, in thrusting them into dun- \ngeons to rot and starve, and then evading the cost of feeding them by \npresenting them to the faithful as objects of charity, that the proclama- \ntion which Gregory issued August 15th, 1376, is perhaps the most \nshameless monument of a shameless age. n \n\nWhen an arrested heretic had unpaid debts, the judges simply \ncanceled the debts on the ground that no heretic could engage in legal \ntransactions. Thus, "creditors were shamelessly cheated." The entire \nfinancial network of European society was strained by its religious \nmasters. "In addition to the misery inflicted by these wholesale \nconfiscations on the thousands of innocent and helpless women and \nchildren thus stripped of everything. ... All safeguards were with- \ndrawn from every transaction. No creditor or purchaser could be sure of \nthe orthodoxy of him with whom he was dealing. . . . The practice of \nproceeding against the memory of the dead after an interval virtually \nunlimited, rendered it impossible for any man to feel secure in the \npossession of property, whether it had descended in his family for \ngenerations, or had been acquired within an ordinary lifetime." 34 \n\nProperty could be seized from the dead, whose bones might be \ndug up from their graves and burned as post-mortem heretics; then \nthe property was taken away from legal heirs. 35 If a person knowing he \nwas about to be arrested tried to sell or give away his property, or to \ncommit suicide before the torturers got to him, his property was seized, \nbecause a heretic was forbidden to make any legal transaction, and a \nsuicide could bequeathe property to no one; it was taken by the church. \nIf the accused fled the country, he was tried and convicted in \nabsentia. Families of the accused were left destitute, and no one dared \nhelp them for fear of falling under suspicion. The Inquisition estab- \nlished the law of property seizure for suicides, which remained the rule \nin most European countries and the British Isles until 1870. 36 \n\nInquisitors could also impose heavy fines. Sometimes it was argued \nthat fines were useless, since all the property of the accused heretic \ndisappeared in confiscation anyway; but the inquisitors invented a class \n\n440 \n\n\n\nf unwitting miscreants called "defenders," whose heresy might Inquisition \n\n:onsist only of a single thoughtless word overheard or spoken. These \n\nould be fined for their oversight. 37 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe system of fines often developed into a protection racket, \nnquisitors could "exchange the punishment of the body with the \n>unishment of the purse," as Scot put it, and there were many who \niaid annual fees to escape persecution. 38 \n\nA person who opposed or impeded the inquisitors in any way \niecame at once excommunicate, and after a year in this condition \nt -as "handed over without further ceremony to the secular arm for \n>urning, without trial and without forgiveness." No one was acquir- \ned. If a confession could not be obtained which was extremely rare, \nbanks to the use of torture the sentence was "not proven." Even \nben, the prisoner could be kept indefinitely in prison in case new \nvidence should arise, or fresh tortures prove effective. 39 Should a \nictim resist all tortures and survive, which was virtually unheard of, he \ntill was not released. He could be sentenced to life imprisonment for \nobduracy." \n\nThe witch\'s or heretic\'s trial was a mockery. The accused had no \niwyer; Pope Boniface directed that trials must be conducted "simply, \nwithout the noise and form of lawyers." 40 Evidence was accepted from \n\'itnesses who could not legally testify in any other kind of trial, such \ns condemned criminals, other heretics, and children, even as young as \nle age of two. The inquisitor Bodin "valued child witnesses because \n[ their tender age they could easily be persuaded or forced to in- \n>rm." 41 A witness who withdrew adverse testimony was punished \n>r perjury, but his testimony remained on the record. 42 Inquisitorial \nJes for a trial were as follows: \n\n1 . The procedure was kept secret. \n\n2. "Common report" and hearsay were accepted as proof of guilt. \n\n3. Accused was not told of the nature of the charges nor allowed \nlegal counsel. \n\n4. Witnesses were kept concealed. \n\n5. Perjurers, excommunicates, or children could give evidence \nagainst witches. \n\n6. No favorable evidence or character witnesses were permitted. \nIn any case, one who spoke for an accused heretic would be \narrested as an accomplice. \n\n7. Torture was used always, without limit of duration or severity. \nEven if the accused confessed before torture, the torture was \napplied anyway, to "validate" the confession. If the accused \ndied under torture, the record stated that the devil broke his \nneck in prison. \n\n8. Accused was forced to confirm under torture the names of \n"accomplices" suggested to him by the judges. \n\n9. No accused person was found innocent. 43 \n\nOfficially, the rule was that torture could be applied only once. \n\n441 \n\n\n\nInquisition But, by a semantic quibble, it could be "continued" any number of \n\ntimes, even over a period of years, each pause being considered a \n^^^im "suspension," not an end. There are records of some victims tortured \nover fifty times. 44 The Inquisition\'s handbook, Malleus Maleficarum, \nsaid the accused witch must be "often and frequently exposed to \ntorture. If after being fittingly tortured she refuses to confess the \ntruth, he [the inquisitor] should have other engines of torture brought \nbefore her, and tell her that she will have to endure these if she does \nnot confess. If then she is not induced by terror to confess, the torture \nmust be continued." If she remained obdurate, "she is not to be \naltogether released, but must be sent to the squalor of prison for a year, \nand be tortured, and be examined very often, especially on the more \nHoly Days." 45 \n\nAnother official rule was that the church did not shed blood. \nTherefore, victims were handed over to the secular arm (civil courts) \nfor execution. This was called relaxing or abandoning them. It was \naccompanied by a token plea for mercy: "We cast you forth from this \nour ecclesiastical Court, and leave you to be delivered to the secular \narm. But we earnestly pray that the said secular court may temper its \njustice with mercy, that there be no bloodshed or danger of death." 46 \n\nThis plea was the emptiest of formalities, designed only to absolve \nthe church of responsibility for bloodshed. In fact, "to be delivered to \nthe secular arm" was an irrevocable death sentence, which the secular \ncourt was compelled to carry out. To temper justice with "mercy" \nmeant permission to strangle the victim before she was burned, but this \nwas not often done. 47 \n\nHistory was written to order by church historians who claimed the \nchurch "took no part in the corporal punishment of heretics." \nEcclesiastical euphemism forced on civil authorities a guilt that be- \nlonged at the church\'s door. Magistrates were commanded to carry \nout the death penalty by the dire threat of excommunication and \nconsequent arrest. "The remorseless logic of St. Thomas Aquinas \nrendered it self-evident that the secular power could not escape the duty \nof putting the heretic to death. . . . [T]he only punishment recog- \nnized by the Church as sufficient for heresy was burning alive. Even if \nthe ruler was excommunicated and incapable of legally performing \nany other function, he was not relieved from the obligation of this \nsupreme duty, with which nothing was allowed to interfere. . . . The \nfact is, the Church not only defined the guilt and forced its punishment, \nbut created the crime itself." 48 \n\nThe fiction of the church\'s innocence was exposed by a bull of \nPope Leo X in 1 521. The Senate of Venice had refused to sanction \nthe numerous executions ordered by the Inquisition. The Pope wrote to \nhis legate, "We declare and order you to exhort and command the \naforesaid Senate of Venice, their Doge and his officials, to intervene no \nmore in this kind of trial, but promptly, without changing or inspect- \ning the sentences made by the ecclesiastical judges, to execute the \n\n\n\n442 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsentences which they are enjoined to carry out. And if they neglect or Inquisition \n\nrefuse, you are to compel them with the Church\'s censure and other \n\nappropriate legal measures. From this order there is no appeal." 49 A ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ndirective published in 1 599 said judges were bound under pain of \n\nmortal sin to execute witches; anyone who objected to the death \n\nsentence was suspected of complicity. 50 \n\nInquisitors "jealously guarded their records from all outsiders." 51 \nOn one occasion, magistrates of Brescia objected to burning a \nnumber of condemned witches without having examined records of \ntheir trials. But the inquisitors kept their records sequestered, and the \npope declared the magistrates\' reluctance a scandal to the faith. "He \nordered the excommunication of the magistrates if within six days \nthey did not execute the convicts ... a decision which was held to give \nthe secular courts six days in which to carry out the sentence of \ncondemnation." 52 \n\nEven when kept hidden, records were often falsified. Inquisitors \nhad special terms for everything they did. For example, torturers said \ntheir victims were "laughing" when they contorted their faces with pain; \nor "sleeping" when they fainted. Those who died under torture \neither "committed suicide" or were slain by the devil. Having confessed \nunder torture, the accused was compelled to repeat the confession \noutside the torture chamber, knowing he would be returned thereto if \nhe didn\'t obey; nevertheless, this was recorded as a confession given \n"freely and spontaneously, without the pressure of force or fear," and \ncourt documents often claimed the accused had confessed without \n[torture. Sometimes confessions were described as "voluntary" if they \njwere obtained after the first degree of torture binding and racking. 53 \nL\\n episcopal scribe at Pamiers naively wrote that a prisoner confessed of \n[his own accord "after he was taken down from the torture." 54 \n\nSome victims were listed as "confessed without torture" after \nexposure to only one instrument, a spiked iron press that crushed the \nlegs. Friedrich von Spee, a Jesuit who acted as confessor for condemned \npitches and developed some compassion for them, wrote of this \npractice: "And they call that \'Confessed without torture\' ! What kind of \ninsight can those have who lack all understanding of such pains? How \ntan outstandingly learned men judge and discriminate when they \ncannot understand the language, the specialists\' jargon, of the inquisi- \ntors? " In his Cautio Criminalis, von Spee wrote: \n\nWhy do you search so diligently for sorcerers? I will show you at once \nwhere they are. Take the Capuchins, the Jesuits, all the religious \norders, and torture them they will confess. If some deny, repeat it a few \ntimes they will confess. Should a few still be obstinate, exorcise them, \nshave them, only keep on torturing they will give in. If you want more, \ntake the Canons, the Doctors, the Bishops of the Church they will \nconfess. s$ \n\nAnother unusual churchman, Bernard Delicieux, was excom- \n\n\n\n443 \n\n\n\nInquisition \n\n\n\nHenri Boguet \n\nHighly active \ninquisitorial judge \nwhose book, Discours \ndes sorciers (1590) \nbecame a standard \nreference. \n\n\n\nmunicated, arrested, tortured, and burned alive for expressing the \nopinion that St. Peter and St. Paul, if tried by the Inquisition\'s \nmethods, would certainly be convicted of heresy. 56 \n\nInquisitors were placed entirely above the law by Pope Innocent \nIV in his bull of 1252, Ad extirpanda. 57 Every ruler and citizen must \nassist them on pain of excommunication. Resistance could place the \nwhole community under interdict, or force payment of heavy fines. \nAny individual fined by the Inquisition could be held in prison until he \npaid, or died. Torture was officially sanctioned in 1257 and remained \na legal recourse of the church for five and a half centuries until it was \nabolished by Pope Pius VII in 1816. 58 \n\nThe victims in those five and a half centuries were literally \ncountless. Official burnings were only a beginning. There were also \nthe disrupted, starving families; unrecorded suicides; unofficial lynch- \nings; hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, who died unnoticed in \nthe papal crusades against heretical groups. There were late-Renais- \nsance witch hunts in Protestant countries, which had no formal \nconnection with the Inquisition but certainly took their impetus from it. \n\nThe chronicler of Treves reported that in the year 1 586, the entire \nfemale population of two villages was wiped out by the inquisitors, \nexcept for only two women left alive. 59 Two other villages were \ndestroyed completely and erased from the map. 60 A hundred and \nthirty-three persons were burned in a single day at Quedlinburg in \n1589, out of a town of 12,000. Henri Boguet said Germany in 1590 \nwas "almost entirely occupied with building fires (for witches); and \nSwitzerland has been compelled to wipe out many of her villages on \ntheir account. Travelers in Lorraine may see thousands and thousands \nof the stakes to which witches are bound." 61 \n\nIn 1 524, one thousand witches died at Como. 62 Strasbourg burned \nfive thousand in a period of 20 years. 63 The Senate of Savoy \ncondemned 800 witches at one time. Parame stated that over thirty \nthousand were executed in the 1 5 th century. 64 Nicholas Remy said \nhe personally sentenced 800 witches in 1 5 years and in one year alone \nforced sixteen witches to suicide. A bishop of Bamberg claimed 600 \nwitches in 10 years; a bishop of Nancy, 800 in 16 years; a bishop of \nWurtzburg, 1900 in 5 years. Five hundred were executed within \nthree months at Geneva and 400 in a single day at Toulouse. The city \nof Treves burned 7,000 witches. The Lutheran prelate Benedict \nCarpzov, who claimed to have read the Bible 53 times, sentenced \n20,000 devil-worshippers. Even relatively permissive England killed \n30,000 witches between 1542 and 1736. The slaughter went on \nthroughout Christian Europe for nearly five centuries. 65 \n\nMass burnings on the Iberian peninsula were known as autos-de-fe \n(acts of faith). They were held once a month on the average, usually \non a Sunday or holiday so all could attend; to stay away was thought \nsuspicious. Sometimes the spectators were invited to participate, as in \nthe diversion genially known as "shaving the new Christians." This \n\n\n\n444 \n\n\n\nmeant setting fire to the hair or beards of those waiting their turn at Inquisition \n\nthe stake. 66 \n\nWholesale burnings in Germany are suggested by the observation ^^^^^^^^^^ \nof a visitor to Wolfenbuttel in 1 590: there were so many stakes to \nburn the witches that the place of execution resembled a small forest. \nThe executioner of Neisse in Silesia invented an oven in which he \nroasted to death forty-two women and young girls in one year. Within \nnine years he had roasted over a thousand persons, including children \nj two to four years old. 67 \n\nInquisitors were empowered to absolve each other, their offi- \ncers, torturers, and executioners, of blood guilt for their victims\' deaths, \nwhether in the prison, in the torture chamber, or at the stake. 68 They \nalso forced the condemned witches to recite: "I free all men, especially \nthe ministers and magistrates, of the guilt of my blood; I take it wholly \nupon myself, my blood be upon my own head." Some witches even \nwere made to repudiate the more impossible confessions extorted by \ntorture, as a suicidal device: "Through the temptation of the devil I \nmade up that confession on purpose to destroy my own life, being \nweary of it, and choosing rather to die than live." These abject \nrecitations preceded the trip to the stake, for it was common practice \n| to silence witches on their way to execution, either by wooden gags, or \nby cutting out their tongues, to prevent communication with the \ncrowd. 69 \n\nInquisitors didn\'t want to give witches a chance to reveal that they \nhad been raped in prison, the usual practice of torturers and their \nassistants during preliminary "stripping." 70 By the curious morality of \nthe day, outrage could be excited by sexual "irregularities" although \nspectacles of hideous torment were received without serious objection. \nThe people of Toulouse gathered evidence against an inquisitor \nnamed Foulques de Saint-George to prove he arrested women for the \nsole purpose of abusing them sexually. 71 Apparently this was consid- \nered worse than torturing them. \n\nSome records hint that executioners could indulge their lusts as \nlong as they were circumspect. The day in 1 589 at Quedlinburg, 133 \nwitches were burned and four inexplicably disappeared. "Four beautiful \ngirls were spared by the executioner, who gave out that the devil had \nspirited them away." 72 They were never seen again. One can well \nimagine who this "devil" was and what happened to the poor girls \nbefore they were finally murdered. \n\nIt can hardly be doubted that a major driving force of all witch \nhunts was sadistic sexual perversion. Torturers liked to attack wom- \nen\'s breasts and genitals with pincers, pliers, and red-hot irons. Under \nthe Inquisition\'s rules, little girls were prosecuted and tortured for \nI witchcraft a year earlier than little boys at 9 1 /2, as opposed to 10 Vi for \nwys. Witch hunting generally was directed against the female sex, \nand the abject helplessness of imprisoned and tortured women invari- \nably encouraged sexual abuse along with every other kind of abuse. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n445 \n\n\n\nInquisition Late in the 14th century it became a rule that prisoners in solitary \n\nconfinement (usually women) could be visited in their cells by \n^^^m^^^^mm "zealous Catholics" (always men; female visitors were not allowed). 73 \n\nOne inquisitorial judge, Dietrich Flade, experienced a revulsion \nfor his lifework and dared to say openly that the confessions wrung \nfrom his victims were false, due only to their agony. His archbishop had \nFlade arrested and put on the rack himself until he admitted having \nsold his soul to Satan; then he was burned. 74 \n\nAnother who ran into trouble for speaking too freely was Peter the \nPrecentor of Paris, who said the Inquisition blackmailed rich people \nand falsely accused and arrested "certain honest matrons" who "refused \nto consent to the lasciviousness of priests." 75 Civil magistrates who \ncriticized the Inquisition often found themselves in its dungeons. When \nthe governor of Albi defended his people against the inquisitors in \n1306, letters were forged and "discovered" in church records to remove \nhim from office on the ground that his grandfather was a convicted \nheretic. 76 \n\nPredictably, inquisitors often went in fear of their own lives, \nappearing in public with escorts of armed guards. Some were attend- \ned by small armies of toughs whose disruptive behavior was absolved by \ntheir masters, so they could literally get away with murder, robbery, \nand rape; they were "above the law." 77 Many inquisitors wore armor \nunder their habits and tested all their food for poison. Torquemada\'s \nchief protege Pedro Arbues was assassinated by relatives of some of his \nvictims in a church in Aragon as he left his guards and went alone to \nthe altar to receive the sacrament. During the 19th century, Pedro \nArbues was canonized as a saint by Pope Pius IX. 78 \n\nAnother inquisitor-saint was Peter Martyr (Piero da Verona), \nwhose case has never been adequately explained. He was so zealous \nin Lombardy as to embarrass even the church; apparently it was decided \nthat he would be more useful dead than alive. In 1252 he was \nassassinated, and within a year he was canonized the fastest creation of \na saint on record. His killers were captured but not prosecuted. One \nof them later became an inquisitor himself. Another entered the \nDominican order, died in old age, and was canonized as St. Acerinus; \nhis portrait appeared in a stall of Peter Martyr\'s own church in 1505. A \nthird conspirator was arrested and imprisoned by the Inquisition 43 \nyears after the murder, possibly because he was beginning to talk too \nmuch. 79 \n\nAnother curious case was that of the heretic who nearly became a j \nsaint, Armanno Pongilupo, a high-ranking official of the Catharan \nsect at Ferrara in the 1 3th century. Pretending devout Catholicism, \nPongilupo secretly gave aid to imprisoned heretics. He played the \npart of piety so well that after his death, altars and images were dedicated i \nto him; he received a magnificent tomb in the cathedral; stories were \ntold of his miraculous cures of the sick, the lame, and the blind. \nFerrara\'s citizens demanded his canonization, but the church re- \n\n\n\n446 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nfused, ordering that his remains be exhumed and burned for his heresy. Inquisition \n\nFerrara would not comply. The cathedral was placed under interdict \n\nand its chapter was excommunicated. Arguments about Pongilupo ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ndragged on for 33 years. Finally, the inquisitor Guido da Vincenza \n\nended the matter by having Pongilupo\'s bones burned, his altars \n\ndestroyed, and his heirs deprived of their property which naturally \n\nreverted to the church. Guido was rewarded with the episcopate of \n\nFerrara. 80 \n\nThe Inquisition was not organized to administer justice; it was \norganized to enrich the church and silence its critics. Lea says, "All \nthe safeguards which human experience had shown to be necessary in \njudicial proceedings of the most trivial character were deliberately cast \naside in these cases, where life and reputation and property through \nthree generations were involved. Every doubtful point was decided \n\'in favor of the faith\'. . . . Had the proceedings been public, there might \nhave been some check upon this hideous system, but the Inquisition \nshrouded itself in the awful mystery of secrecy until after sentence had \nbeen awarded and it was ready to impress the multitude with the \nfearful solemnities of the auto da fe." 81 \n\nThe Inquisition remained active until 1834, especially in Central \nand South America, where "heathen" natives were tortured and \nburned for crimes against the true faith, such as not believing in it. 82 \nMayan scribes in Central America wrote: "Before the coming of the \nSpaniards, there was no robbery or violence. The Spanish invasion was \nthe beginning of tribute, the beginning of church dues, the beginning \nof strife." 83 Catholic fathers of the mission of San Francisco burned \nmany Indian "witches" before the tribes were sufficiently subdued to \naccept God\'s word. 84 Lea said, "An inquisitor seems to have been \nregarded as a necessary portion of the missionary outfit." 85 \n\nEven in the present century, Catholic authorities have tried to \npresent the Inquisition in an undeservedly flattering light. Cardinal \nLepicier, expressly supported by Pope Pius X, declared the church\'s \nreign of terror was right, just because the church did it. "The naked \nfact that the Church, of her own authority, has tried heretics and \ncondemned them to be delivered to death, shows that she truly has \npie right of killing. . . . [W]ho dares to say that the Church has erred in a \nblatter so grave as this?" 86 \n\nIn fact, many have dared to say so. Leland wrote: "When people \nbelieve, or make believe, in a thing so very much as to torture like \ndevils and put to death hundreds of thousands of fellow-beings, mostly \nhelpless and poor old women, not to mention many children, it \nsecomes a matter of very serious import to all humanity to determine \n:>nce for all whether the system or code according to which this was \ndone was absolutely right for ever, or not." 87 Anthropologist Jules \nHenry said, "Organized religion, which likes to fancy itself the \nTiother of compassion, long ago lost its right to that claim by its \njrganized support of organized cruelty." 88 Coulton said of the \n\n\n\n447 \n\n\n\nInquisition Inquisition, "History affords few plainer examples of the demoralizing \n\neffects of absolute power upon fairly ordinary men." 89 And Vetter \n\n^ wm mm pointed out that the system that created such horrors may be still \ndangerous: \n\nHave religious institutions been any more humane in the process of \nconsolidating their power than has secular machinery similarly occu- \npied? The taste for slaughter exhibited by the sons of the Prophet was \nmore than matched by that of Christians who liquidated heathen and \nheretic. . . . The cultural backgrounds of the past and current generation \nof political dictators provides interesting material for speculation. Mus- \nsolini, Franco, Salazar, Hitler, Peron and almost without exception the \nLatin-American dictators were or are Roman Catholics, at least in their \neducation and upbringing. And Stalin had considerable training for the \npriesthood of an equally dictatorial church. Confronted with such facts \none is compelled at least to ask himself what kind of causal sequences are \nhere suggested. . . . \n\nIn both Islam and Christendom the naive believers have over long \nperiods been taught that it was their duty to slaughter the unbeliever, or \nwhoever refused to accept their particular version of divine guidance. \nThey have not had a change of heart; they have just been shorn of the \npowers for mischief. * \n\nIt is unsettling to realize that such powers for mischief could yet \nbe revived. The edicts that established the Inquisition have never been \nrepealed. They are "officially still part of the Catholic faith, and were \nused as justification for certain practices as recently as 1969." 91 \n\nJulian Huxley deplored the "pestilent doctrine on which all the \nchurches have insisted, that honest disbelief in their more or less \nastonishing creeds is a moral offense . . . deserving and involving the \nsame future retribution as murder and robbery." In his opinion, the \nworst visions of hell would seem pale beside a comprehensive vision of \nChristianity\'s gory history. 92 Such history should be remembered, on \nthe old principle that those who cannot remember their history are \ncondemned to repeat it. \n\nI.

One example: \n\nWho dost make the green herb to spring up, mistress of mankind! Who \nhast created everything, who dost guide aright all creatures! Mother \nIshtar, whose power no god can approach! A prayer will I utter; may she \n\ndo unto me what seems good unto her O my mistress, make me to \n\nknow my deed, establish for me a place of rest! Absolve my sins, lift up my \nface! 3 \n\nA Babylonian prayer that obviously prefigured the prayers and \npsalms of biblical writers, even the biblical theology, said to the Goddess: \n"0 Thou art adorable, who givest salvation, life, and justice, vivify \nmy name." 4 Like the Old Testament God, Ishtar was the Mighty One, \nwinner of battles and overthrower of mountains. 5 She said: \n\nIn the brilliant heavens, to give omens in abundance, I appear, I appear in \nperfection. With exultation in my supremacy, with exultation do I, a \nGoddess, walk supreme; Ishtar, the Goddess of evening, am I; Ishtar, the \nGoddess of morning, am I; Ishtar, who opens the portals of heaven, in \nmy supremacy. The heavens I destroy, the earth I devastate, in my \nsupremacy. Who rises resplendent on the firmament of heaven, in- \nvoked above and below, in my supremacy. The mountain I sweep away \naltogether, in my supremacy. The great wall of the mountain am I, \ntheir great foundation am I, in my supremacy. 6 \n\nA long Babylonian prayer presents numerous metaphors and \nliturgical phrases later copied by Jewish priests on behalf of their god: \n\nI beseech thee, Lady of ladies, Goddess of goddesses, Ishtar, queen of all \ncities, leader of all men. Thou art the light of the world, thou art the \nlight of heaven . . . .Supreme is thy might, O Lady, exalted art thou above \nall gods. Thou renderest judgment and thy decision is righteous; unto \nthee are subject the laws of the earth and the laws of heaven, the laws of \nthe temple and of the shrine, and the laws of the private apartment and \nof the secret chamber. Where is the place where thy name is not, and \nwhere is the spot where thy commandments are not known? At thy \nname the earth and the heavens shake, and the gods they tremble; the \nspirits of heaven tremble at thy name and the men hold it in awe. Thou \nart great, thou art exalted; all the men ofSumer, and all creatures, and all \nmankind glorify thy name. With righteousness dost thou judge the \ndeeds of men, even thou; thou lookest upon the oppressed and to the \ndowntrodden thou bringest justice every day. How long, Queen of \nHeaven and Earth, how long, how long, Shepherdess of pale-faced men, \nwilt thou tarry? How long, O Queen whose feet are not weary and \nwhose knees make haste? How long, Lady of Hosts, Lady of Battles? \nGlorious one whom all the spirits of heaven fear, who subduest all \nangry gods; mighty above all rulers, who holdest the reins of kings. \nOpener of the womb of all women, great is thy light. Shining light of \nheaven, light of the world, enlightener of all the places where men dwell, \nwhogatherest together the hosts of the nations. Goddess of men, \n\n\n\n451 \n\n\n\nIshtar divinity of women, thy counsel passeth understanding. Where thou \n\nglancest the dead come to life, and the sick rise and walk; and the mind \n\n^^_^^____^^_ that is distressed is healed when it looks upon thy face. How long, O Lady, \n\nshall mine enemy triumph over me? Command, and at thy command \nthe angry god will turn back. Ishtar is great! Ishtar is Queen! My Lady is \nexalted, my Lady is Queen. 7 \n\nAkkadian sources show that Ishtar was the same Great Goddess \nrevered all over the Near East under such names as Dea Syria, Astarte, \nCybele, Aphrodite, Kore, Mari, etc.: \n\nPraise Ishtar, the most awesome of the Goddesses, revere the queen of \nwomen, the greatest of the deities. She is clothed with pleasure and \nlove. She is laden with vitality, charm, and voluptuousness. In lips she is \nsweet; life is in her mouth. At her appearance rejoicing becomes full. \n\nShe is glorious The fate of everything she holds in her hand. . . . \n\nIshtar to her greatness who can be equal? Strong, exalted, splendid \nare her decrees. . . . Ishtar among the gods, extraordinary is her station. \nRespected is her word; it is supreme over them. She is their queen; \nthey continually cause her commands to be executed. All of them bow \ndown before her. 8 \n\nThe powers of the underworld bowed down before her when \nshe went underground to rescue her son-lover Tammuz, as her Sumeri- \nan forerunner Inanna rescued the same son-lover, Dumuzi. She said \nto the seven gatekeepers: "If thou openest not the gate so that I cannot \nenter, I will smash the door, I will shatter the bolt, I will smash the \ndoorpost, I will move the doors, I will raise up the dead, eating the \nliving, so that the dead will outnumber the living." 9 This threat was \ntypical of Ishtar\'s dark underworld twin, Eresh-kigal, the Death-goddess \nwho had power to deprive the heavenly gods of their sacrificial \nfood. 10 Ishtar\'s temporary departure caused sterility and suspension of \nsexual activities over the whole earth: "After the Lady Ishtar has \ndescended, the bull no longer mounts the cow, the ass no longer bends \nover the she-ass, and the man no longer bends over the woman in the \nstreet: the man slept in his place, the woman slept alone." n \n\nThis Descent into Hell was a perilous but necessary part of the \nsacred drama, lasting three days and culminating in the Day of Joy, \nwhen the god was restored to life. 12 This inaugurated a new year after \npenitential atonement and sacrifice. "It is on New Year\'s Day that \nIshtar lies with Tammuz, and the king reproduces this mythical hiero- \ngamy by consummating the ritual union with the Goddess [i.e., with \nthe hierodule who represents her on earth] in a secret chamber of the \ntemple, where the nuptial bed of the Goddess stands." n \n\nGilgamesh said the Goddess was cruel to her lovers, since each in \nturn personified the dying god who refreshed the earth\'s fertility with \nhis blood. 14 When the god was incarnate in bulls, the animals were \nemasculated and their severed genitals thrown to the Goddess\'s \nimage, a rite "probably derived from the rite of self-emasculation which \nhad been practiced in honor of Ishtar." 15 Ishtar\'s priestesses apparently \n\n\n\n452 \n\n\n\nperformed some version of the rite each year in the temple of Jerusa- \nlem, where the virgin form of the Goddess was called Mari, Mari-Anna, \nor Miriam, and her holy women annually wailed for the sacrificial death \nof Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14).

She was the Goddess from whom all becoming arose." \' As the \nCreatress, she gave birth to the sun "when he rose upon this earth for \nthe first time." 2 Her title, "Giver of Life," was applied also to the queen \nmother of Egypt. 5 \n\nIn her Roman mysteries, Isis was addressed as "the One Who is \nAll." Lucius\'s hymn to her said: \n\nO Thou holy and eternal Savior of the human race. . . . Thou bestowest a \nmother\'s tender affections on the misfortunes of unhappy mortals. . . . \nThou dispellest the storms of life and stretchest forth thy right hand of \nsalvation, by which Thou unravellest even the inextricably tangled web \nof Fate. . . . Thou turnest the earth in its orb; Thou givest light to the sun; \nThou rulest the world; Thou treadest Death underfoot. To Thee the \nstars are responsive; by Thee the seasons turn and the gods rejoice and the \nelements are in subjection. . . . lam too feeble to render Thee suffi- \ncient praise. . . . But, a pious though poor worshipper, 1 shall essay to do all \nwithin my power; Thy divine countenance and most holy deity I shall \nguard and keep forever hidden in the secret place of my heart. * \n\nAnother devout Roman Isis-worshipper, Apuleius, quoted her \nresponse to him, when he addressed her under several other Goddess- \n\n\n\nnames: \n\n\n\nlam Nature, the parent of things, the sovereign of the elements, the \nprimary progeny of time, the most exalted of the deities, the first of the \nheavenly gods and goddesses, the queen of the dead, the uniform \ncountenance; manifested alone and under one form. . . .At my will the \nplanets of the sky, the wholesome winds of the seas, and the mournful \nsilences of hell are disposed; my name, my divinity is adored through- \nout the world, in divers manners, in variable customs, and by many names. \nFor the Phrygians that are the first of all men call me the Mother of \nthe gods ofPessinus; the Athenians, which are sprung from their own \nsoil, Cecropian Minerva; the Cyprians, which are girt about by the sea, \nPaphian Venus; the Cretans, which bear arrows, Dictynian Diana; the \nSicilians, which speak three tongues, infernal Proserpine; the Eleusinians, \ntheir ancient goddess Ceres; some Juno, others Bellona, others Hecate, \nothers Ramnusie . . . the Egyptians, skilled in ancient lore, worship me \nwith proper ceremonies, and call me by my true name, Queen Isis. s \n\n\n\nLucius of Patrae \n\nAuthor of a lost \nMetamorphoses \nwhich furnished a \nprecedent and basic \nmaterial for the \nMetamorphoses of \nLucius Apuleius, a \ndevotee of Isis and \nPlatonic philosopher of \nthe 2nd century a.d. \n\n\n\n453 \n\n\n\nIsis Aristides also was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis, and spoke \n\nof a mystical experience during which he saw, coming from Isis, "a \n\n_^ m ^ m ^ BB Light and other unutterable things conducing to salvation." To be \ninitiated into her cult brought a privileged status after death (an idea \ncopied later by Christians): "Isis, the \'eternal savior of the race of \nmen,\' promises her votary: Thou shalt live in blessedness; thou shalt \nlive glorious under my protection. And when thou hast finished thy \nlife-course and goest down to the underworld, even there in that lower \nworld thou shalt see me shedding light in the gloom of Acheron and \nreigning in the inmost regions of Styx; thou thyself shalt inhabit the \nElysian Fields and shalt continually offer worship to me, ever \ngracious.\'" 6 \n\nEgyptians addressed her as "Mistress of the gods, thou bearer of \nwings, thou lady of the red apparel, queen of the crowns of the South \nand North, only One . . . superior to whom the gods cannot be, thou \nmighty one of enchantments (or, Words of Power) . . . thou who art \npre-eminent, mistress and lady of the tomb, Mother in the horizon of \nheaven . . . Praise be unto thee, O Lady, who art mightier than the \ngods, words of adoration rise unto thee from the Eight Gods of \nHermopolis. The living souls who are in their hidden places praise \nthe mystery of thee, O thou who art their mother, thou source from \nwhich they sprang, who makest for them a place in the hidden \nUnderworld, who makest sound their bones and preservest them from \nterror, who makest them strong in the abode of everlastingness." Her \nname may have come from Ashesh, meaning both "pouring out" and \n"supporting," an implication that her divine essence (blood or milk) \nkept the gods and all other creatures alive. 7 \n\nIsis was the Egyptian throne. Pharaohs sat on her lap, protected by \nher arms or wings. 8 The symbol she carried on her crown was the \nmu\'at, "foundation of the throne," which also represented her alter ego \nMaat, the motherhood-principle called Right, Justice, Truth, or the \nAll-seeing Eye. 9 An Egyptian hymn was copied into the Bible: "Right \nand justice are the foundation of thy throne" (Psalms 89:14). \n\nHermetic texts said Isis revealed the mysteries of the stars to God, \n\nwho was her son. 10 She also provided a model for Moses\'s miracle of \n\nSign of his stopping the waters, which she did quite casually on her way to Byblos; \n\nand Joshua\'s miracle of stopping the sun, which she did while \nbringing Horus back to life. 11 Since Horus was the sun Ra or Osiris in \nthe form of Isis\'s infant an interruption of his life would naturally \nhave caused the sun to stand still in heaven. \n\nIsis and her dark twin sister Nephthys were Egyptian versions of \nthe familiar creating-and-destroying Goddess, Mother of Life and \nCrone of Death. Egyptians called her by many names: Mut, Hathor, \nBast, Maat, Heqit, Sekhmet, Sati, Neith, etc. Some of her destructive \nfunctions were described in the Book of the Dead: \n\nTerrible one, lady of the rain-storm, destroyer of the souls of men, \ndevourer of the bodies of men, orderer, producer, and maker of \n\n\n\n454 \n\n\n\n\nslaughter . . . Hewer-in-pieces in blood, Ahibit, lady of hair. . . . Fire-lover, \npure one, lover of slaughterings, cutter off of heads, devoted one, lady \nof the Great House . . . her name is Clother, hider of her creations, \n\nconqueror of hearts, swallower of them Knife which cutteth when \n\nits name is uttered, slayer of those who approach thy flame. 12 \n\nIsis swallowed Osiris the savior and brought him back to life. \nHe was reincarnated as the child Horus, or else as the ithvphallic moon- \ngod Min, or Menu, "He who impregnates his mother." n He was \nannually torn to pieces and reassembled except for his lost penis. Isis \nmade him a new penis of clay, then gave it and him new life by \ninvoking her own holy names as life-giver and death-giver: "Behold, I \nhave found thee lying there. Weary is the great one . . . . O Osiris, \nlive, stand up thou unfortunate one that liest there! I am Isis. I am \nNephthys." H So Osiris stood up, and lived, and mated with his \nGoddess, and life went on. Osiris-Min\'s counterpart Adonis was similar- \nly reborn from the Goddess as Priapus and was similarly associated \nwith spring floods. 15 \n\nSome said the annual Nile flood was caused by a teardrop from \nIsis\'s eye as she raised her lament for the dead god. The Nile festival \ntook place on the "Night of the Tear-Drop," unwittingly preserved by \nMoslems as the June festival of Lelat al-Nuktah, "Night of the \nDrop." Worshippers said to the Goddess: "Thou givest life unto the \nflocks and herds, all the land drinks thee when thou descendest . . . \nwhen thou comest the whole land rejoices. Thou art the bringer of food, \nthou art the mighty one of meat and drink, thou art the creator of all \ngood things. Thou fillest the storehouses, thou heapest high with corn \nthe granaries, and thou hast care for the poor and needy." 16 \n\nIsis was worshipped throughout the Greco-Roman world, "from \nAlexandria to Aries, from the outskirts of the Sahara to the isle of \nBritain, from the mountains of Asturias to the mouths of the Dan- \nube." 17 Prevalence of the fairy tale "The Witch in the Stone Boat" \nshows how widely Isis\'s cult traveled, for the "witch" was none other \nthan she; each of her temples featured a carved stone moon-boat \ncontaining her figure, which Christians called a witch or demoness. In \npagan times, Isis\'s boat had its own special holiday on the 5th of \nMarch, the Navigium Isidis, Blessing of the Vessel of Isis. 18 \n\nIsis\'s cult came to Rome about 80 B.C., attained great popularity in \nthe reign of Vespasian, and flourished throughout the empire until it \nwas ousted by Christianity four centuries later. The Goddess herself was \nnot so much ousted as absorbed. Her identification with the virgin \nMary was part of the syncretic development of the Madonna cult. Some \nearly Christians in Rome called themselves Pastophori, a title of \n"shepherds" or "servants of Isis," which evolved intopa5tors. 19 \n\nThe story of Mary\'s Egyptian journey with her child seems to have \nbeen devised not only to fulfill the scripture, "Out of Egypt have I \ncalled my son" (Matthew 2:1 5), but also to justify the extensive \nidentifications between Isis and Mary. One legend said Mary and \n\n\n\nIsis \n\n\n\nBook of the Dead. \n\nCommon name for the \ncollection of \nEgyptian funerary \npapyri written \nbetween 1500 and 1350 \nB.C., including \nVignettes, Hymns, \nChapters, and \ndescriptive Rubrics. \nAmong the best- \npreserved, and most \ntypical, copies of the \nTheban Recension of \nthe Book of the \nDead is the much- \nstudied Papyrus of \nAni. \n\n\n\n455 \n\n\n\nIsra-EI \n\n\n\nJesus took refuge in the holy tree at Mataria, the sycamore of Isis- \nHathor, Goddess of Dendera, the Shrine of the Tree. 20 Isis was \n"Destiny," and so was Mary the triple Moerae. "The tree is a symbol \nof destiny because it is rooted in the depths. But what is more \nimportant is that it grows into time, ramifies its branches like a family \ntree." 21 Mataria was long known as an Egyptian name of the \nGoddess who was also Mata-Meri, or Mari. 22 \n\nPictures and sculptures wherein [Isis] is represented in the act of suckling \nher child Horus formed the foundation for the Christian figures and \npaintings of the Madonna and Child. Several of the incidents oHhe \nwanderings of the Virgin with the Child in Egypt as recorded in the \nApocryphal Gospels reflect scenes in the life of Isis as described in the \ntexts found on the Metternich Stele, and many of the attributes of Isis, \nthe God-mother, the mother of Horus, andofNeith, the goddess of Sais, \nare identical with those of Mary the Mother of Christ. 23 \n\nAn Egyptian amulet in the British Museum shows the Goddess \n\nseated under her holy tree, giving birth to her divine child, and holding \n\nthe ankh in one hand. On the reverse is another ankh and the legend, \n\n"One God in heaven." Some suggest that the picture might represent \n\nthe birth of Buddha, but it is usually interpreted as the birth of \n\nChrist though its original was certainly a picture of Isis. 24 \n\n1.

Jacob was the "sup- \nplanter" who next took the name of the same divinity. The suffix El \nmeant "a deity," male or female though Bible translators invariably \nrendered it "God" and Is-Ra may have originated as an androgy- \nnous combination of Isis and Ra, or else a father-and-son combination \nof Osiris and Ra. In any event, it was a god-name much older than \nthe story of Jacob. \n\n1.

It was related \nto "the Aphroditean law which permeates matter and causes it to be \nfertilized. It is Aphrodite who fills the two sexes with the urge for \ngeneration, who implants solicitude for the offspring, who forges the \nbond between mother and child and secures the freedom and equality \nof all the progeny. All special privilege is odious to this goddess. \nHence the equal right of all to the sea, the seashore, the air; and the \ncommunis omnium possessio (common property) may be traced back \nto the ius naturale." \' Laws of the matriarchate were not hierarchical, \nbut democratic; and the authority of women was "natural" because it \nwas based on archetypal dependence on the moral instruction of the \nMother. See Motherhood. \n\nl.Bachofen, 189. \n\n\n\nIxion \n\n"Strong Moon-man," sacred king of the Lapiths, "wielders of stone \nweapons." Ixion married the Sky-goddess Dia, and afterward died \nspread-eagled on a fiery wheel, symbol of the sun endlessly rolling \nthrough the heavens. Hellenic myth interpreted this as punishment for a \nsin against Zeus, but the original story was one of sacred-king \nsacrifice, related to "the burning wheels rolled downhill at European \nmidsummer festivities, as a sign that the sun has reached its zenith \nand must now decline again." x \n\nIxion\'s name was akin to axis, the same as the Hindu Akshivan \nwho was an emanation of Shiva personifying the Axle of the World \n{aksha). 1 Thus Ixion was another of the gods whose death took place at \nthe hub of the universe, the axis mundi later assimilated to the cross \nof Christ. \n\n1.

One version said the male twin, Izanagi, reached \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ down from heaven and stirred the Deep with his spear. 1 \n\nThe pair were known as the Male Who Invites and the Female \nWho Invites. Their myth told how they discovered sex and used it to \nwork their creation magic: \n\nHis Augustness, the Male Who Invites, inquired of Her Augustness, the \nFemale Who Invites, "In what manner is your body made?" She \nreplied, "My body in its thriving grows, but there is one part that does not \ngrow together. "And His Augustness the Male who Invites said to her: \n"My body in its thriving also grows, but there is one part that grows in \nexcess. Therefore, would it not seem proper that I should introduce the \npart of my body in excess into the part of your body that does not grow to- \ngether, and so procreate territories?" \n\nHer Augustness the Female Who Invites said: "It would be well. " \nAnd His Augustness, the Male Who Invites, said to her: "Let us go \nround this August Heavenly Pillar, I and you, and when we shall have \ncome together let us in august union join our august parts. " She \nagreed . . . and where they met, Her Augustness the Female Who Invites \nsaid: "Ah! What a fair and lovely youth! Whereupon His Augustness \nthe Male Who Invites said: "Ah! What a fair and lovely maiden!" 2 \n\nThe earlier myths said Izanami gave birth to all things; but at a \nlater date, an imaginative revisionist took the initiative away from her. \nThe next installment said she was burned to death while giving birth \nto Fire; then she went into the underworld and became a Tiamat-like \nsea monster. Izanagi followed her, but she couldn\'t return to the \nupper world with him because she had eaten underworld fruit (the same \ntheme familiar in Greek myths of Persephone and Eurydice). \n\nIzanagi fled, horrified at his female twin\'s changed appearance. \nShe pursued him with an army of storm-demons, whom he foiled by \nthrowing them peaches, the yonic fruit of life, which they couldn\'t resist \nstopping to pick up. Then Izanagi performed magical purifications \nand developed the ability to give birth to beings. Amaterasu the sun \ngoddess was born from his left eye, a moon god from his right eye, \nand the dragon-slaying hero Susa-no-wo from his nose. The former \nCreatress Izanami, left behind in the underworld, also gave birth to \nmore deities but they were all evil spirits. 3 \n\nl.Larousse,403. 2. Campbell, Or.M., 467-68. 3.

Hjuki was derived from jakka, to assemble, to increase; \nBil from bila, to break up or dissolve. Thus the twins signified forces of \n\n\n\n458 \n\n\n\ncreation and destruction. 1 It was said their faces could be seen forever Jael \n\nin the markings on the moon. Bil\'s voice could be heard in the singing Jahi the Whore \n\nwind, and Hjuki sends moonlight to help night-bound skiers find their ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nway down safely to valley towns. 2 \n\nAn event reported in 1633 suggests that an esoteric meaning of the \nJack and Jill myth might have been embedded in a ritual recognized \nas heresy. A 20-year-old girl named Mary Spencer was convicted of \nwitchcraft because "on her way to the well for water, she often rolled \nher pail down the hill, running before it and in fun calling it to follow \nher." 3 That such apparently trivial actions invited serious charges, \neven death sentences, suggests that they must have been understood in \nsome way other than mere play. \n\n1.

Hence she \npersonified the moon, which was everywhere supposed to be the \n>riginal source of menstruation. Jahi also brought sex into the world \n>y seducing the first man in the primal garden.

The sanctuary was formerly named Brigantium. 1 The \nGoddess\'s symbol, a kteis or vulva in the form of a scallop shell or \ncowrie, was adopted by the cult of the new saint. 2 \n\n\n\n460 \n\n\n\nThe anonymous bones now advertised at Compostela as those of Janua Coeli \n\nSt. James were actually picked up in Galicia during the Middle Ages.

As a personification of \nthe Gate, Juno had two faces looking in both directions the outward \npassage of the Gate at birth, the reverse passage at death. At her \nFestival in early January she was addressed as Antevorta and Postvorta, \nthe Goddess Who Looks Forward and Backward, for January was the \n\n(gate" of the year, when the god of the Aeon died and was reborn from \nlotherTime. 1 \n\nAs Roman religion became more patriarchal, Juno\'s gate-keeping \npersona became an androgynous Janua-Janus, later was wholly mas- \nculinized as the two-faced god Janus to whom all gateways were sacred. \nWe was another form of the Petra, Pater, or Peter, keeper of the keys \n:o the Goddess\'s "Pearly Gate." \n\nThe Christian version of the janua coeli depicted heaven on one \n;ide, hell on the other. The "wrong" or "death" side of the Gate \nbecame known as janua diaboli, "the gate by which the Devil enters." \nSince the whole image was that of a yoni to begin with, it was almost \nnevitable that Christian fathers used janua diaboli as a common \nsynonym for "woman." 2 \n\n1.

This blood would turn liquid when placed beside \nhe skull of a genuine martyr. Pope Pius II himself "infallibly" \nI ttested to the reality of this miracle. 1 \n\nNaturally there was no real St. Januarius; he was only another form \nif Peter, the "Petra" who guarded the heavenly gate (see Peter, \nlaint). As guardian of door and gateways he became the janitor \nneaning "doorkeeper" of heaven. 2 \n\n1. Brewster, 415. 2.

On the fourth day will take \nplace the return of Nabu." The man representing the god was always \npreceded by a jar-bearer, carrying the vessel of water that stood for \nthe god\'s seminal spirit, the medium of his union with the dread \nGoddess. 1 \n\nIn Egypt, the jar was the menat or moon-charm, represented in \nhieroglyphics as fluid pouring from a narrow phallic vessel into a \nwider, female pot or vase. As early as the 6th dynasty, the menat \nsignified the restoration of sexual capacities after rebirth. 2 Unlike \nChristians, who denied sexual activity in heaven (Matthew 22:30, Mark \n12:25, Luke 20:35), Egyptians believed there could be no heavenly \nbliss without sex. Even the Savior Osiris, reborn as "impregnator of his \nMother," followed the menat to his love-death. It was water in a \n"male vessel," the phallic jar. 3 \n\nBoth Osiris and Isis were represented by vessels of water, to merge \nin their mating as completely as two waters in a single jar. The \nconcept was the same as the Tantric image of sexual union blessed by \nthe god of love: a merging of bliss and the void, "like the pouring of \nwater into water." 4 \n\nSimilar imagery underlay creation myths like that of Ashurbani- \npal\'s Twelve Tablets, where the male celestial sea Apsu rained down \nfructifying waters into the sea-womb of Mother Tiamat, the nether sea. 5 \nBecause the ancients thought rain a kind of celestial semen, mytho- \nlogical heavenly fathers tended to be rain gods (e.g., Jupiter Pluvius). \nSince they weren\'t sure whether this fertile fluid from heaven should \nbe called semen or urine, the heavenly father sometimes made "golden \nrain," like the urine with which Zeus impregnated Danae, the \nEarth. 6 Uranus or "Father Heaven" was an archaic producer of \nfertilizing urine. \n\nIn India the spirit of love is still represented by a jar of water \nserving "in the place of a sacred image. The water is regarded, for the \nperiod of the worship, as a residence or seat (pitha) of the god." 7 The \nSanskrit word pitha recalls the Greek pithos or jar signifying rebirth in \nDemeter\'s Eleusinian Mysteries, when she was Mistress of Earth and \nSea and absorbed the substance of gods. 8 \n\nMysteries of the Cabiri in Phrygia and Samothrace worshipped \nDemeter Cabiria in conjunction with the Young God (Ganymede, \nDionysus, or Cabirius) in the form of a male jar-bearer, shown pouring \nwater into a maternal Pot, Vase, Cauldron, or Grail. He was the \nuniversal ephebe; the larger vessel was the universal mother. 9 Similar \n\n\n\n462 \n\n\n\nI mysteries of the two vessels were dramatized throughout the Middle \nj East, so the jar-bearer became the symbol of any dying savior-god \nenroute to his Fate. \n\n\\.Assyr.&Bab.

At first the artificial construct was used to avoid \nspeaking the "real" name of God, which carried a curse. Actually there \nwere many variations of the name, in many Semitic dialects: Yahu, \nJah, Jeud, leu, Yahweh, Jahveh, Yaho, Iao. 1 Another variation was \nJesus, a Latin form of Yeshua, Joshua, or Jeud. (See Yahweh.) \n\n1. Albright, 262. \n\n\n\nJesus ben Pandera \n\nCelsus and the Talmudic tradition mentioned Jesus, son of Pandera \nor Panthera, begotten by a Roman soldier on a Jewish prostitute, \nI Miriam of Magdala (Mary Magdalene), whose husband was a car- \npenter. 1 The word for carpenter, najjar, was applied to a sacred \nbrotherhood, the Nazarites or Nazorenes, who supported themselves \nby woodworking. 2 Jesus ben Pandera was called a najjar, a holy man. He \n| worked miracles, healed the sick, foretold the world\'s end. 3 Eventual- \nly he was executed, perhaps by hanging, through his own wish. \n\nSome said this ben Pandera or Bar-Panther was the grandfather of \nthe Virgin Mary. 4 Other Christian authorities, like Epiphanius, said \nhe was the paternal grandfather of the Christian Jesus which, obvious- \nly, contradicted the Virgin Birth myth. "Son of Pandera" was a title \nso firmly attached to Jesus that many Christian writers accepted it and \ntried to explain it. The name of Pandera as Jesus\'s father is traceable \nI back to the time of the Gospels and has "an equal claim to reliability." 5 \nLater Christians said the name was used by the Jews to discredit their \nsavior by calling him a whore\'s son who was executed as a criminal. \n\nThe "whore" called Miriam of Magdala seems to have been a \nsacred hierodule or Virgin Bride of God, dedicated to the temple \n{magdala). Since the oldest traditions associated Mary Magdalene with \nthe Holy Vase that represented Pandora, the Great Goddess entitled \n"All-Giver," some suggest that Pandera was a corrupt form of this title. 6 \nAnother theory said Jesus ben Pandera really meant Jesus, son of the \nVirgin (Parthenos), the latter being the usual title of a temple hiero- \ndule. 7 Or again, Pan-Thera could have meant Dionysus the son of \nPan, whose totem animal was a panther, or "all-beast." Jesus was \n\n\n\nvar. Panthera \n\n\n\n463 \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\n\n\nassimilated to the Dionysian savior. The story of his miracle at Cana \nwas directly modeled on a Dionysian rite of sacred marriage celebrated \nat Sidon; even the Gospels\' wording was copied from the festival of \nthe older god. 8 \n\nThese few garbled hints of Jesus\'s pagan background may have \nbeen greatly clarified by the hundreds of diverse Gospels extant in the \nfirst few centuries a.d., had not the early church seen fit to destroy them \nall. 9 \n\n1.

The \nLatin name for this \nHeavenly Father came \nfrom the same root: \nIu-piter, Father leu. 8 \n\n\n\nBook of Enoch \n\nConsisting of three \nextant books and a \nlost fourth, the \nEnochian works \nwere written probably \nbetween the \nMaccabean age and the \nfirst century B.C. The \nchief subject is the \ncoming world\'s end \nand the reappearance of \nthe Messianic Son of \nMan, who resembles \nthe predicted final \navatar of Buddha \nappearing before \ndoomsday. \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\nThe Jesus who was called Christos, "Anointed," took his title from \nMiddle-Eastern savior-gods like Adonis and Tammuz, born of the \nVirgin Sea-goddess Aphrodite-Maria (Myrrha), or Ishtar-Mari (He- \nbrew Mariamne). Earlier biblical versions of the same hero were Joshua \nson of Nun (Exodus 33:11), Jehu son of Nimshi, whom Elijah \nanointed as a sacred king (1 Kings 19:16), and Yeshua son of Marah. \nThe Book of Enoch said in the 2nd century B.C. that Yeshua or Jesus \nwas the secret name given by God to the Son of Man (a Persian title), \nand that it meant "Yahweh saves." \' \n\nIn northern Israel the name was written leu. 2 It was the same as \nIeud or Jeud, the "only-begotten son" dressed in royal robes and \nsacrificed by the god-king Isra-El. 3 Greek versions of the name were \nIasion, Jason, or Iasus the name of one of Demeter\'s sacrificed \nconsorts, killed by Father Zeus after the fertility rite that coupled him \nwith his Mother. 4 Iasus signified a healer or Therapeuta, as the \nGreeks called the Essenes, whose cult groups always included a man \nwith the title of Christos. 5 The literal meaning of the name was \n"healing moon-man," fitting the Hebrew version of Jesus as a son of \nMary, the almah or "moon-maiden." 6 (See Virgin Birth.) \n\nIt seems Jesus was not one person but a composite of many. He \nplayed the role of sacred king of the Jews who periodically died in an \natonement ceremony as surrogate for the real king. "The Semitic \nreligions practiced human immolations longer than any other reli- \ngion, sacrificing children and grown men in order to please sanguinary \ngods. In spite of Hadrian\'s prohibition of those murderous offerings, \nthey were maintained in certain clandestine rites." 9 The priesthood of \nthe Jewish God insisted that "one man should die for the people . . . \nthat the whole nation perish not" (John 1 1:50). Yahweh forgave no sins \nwithout bloodshed: "without shedding blood is no remission" (He- \nbrews 9:22). \n\nMiddle-Eastern traditions presented a long line of slain and canni- \nbalized Saviors extending back to prehistory. At first kings, they became \nking-surrogates or "sacred" kings as the power of real monarchies \n\n\n\n464 \n\n\n\ndeveloped. The Gospels\' Jesus was certainly not the first of them, Jesus Christ \n\nthough he may have been one of the last. One passage hints at a \n\nholy man\'s understandable fear of such brief, doomed eminence: ^^^^^^^^- \n\n"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him \n\nby force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain \n\nhimself alone" (John 6:15). \n\nThis Jesus seems to have made little or no impression on his \ncontemporaries. No literate person of his own time mentioned him in \nany known writing. The Gospels were not written in his own time, nor \nwere they written by anyone who ever saw him in the flesh. The \nnames of the apostles attached to these books were fraudulent. The \nbooks were composed after the establishment of the church, some as \nlate as the 2nd century a.d. or later, according to the church\'s require- \nments for a manufactured tradition. 10 Most scholars believe the \nearliest book of the New Testament was 1 Thessalonians, written \nperhaps 5 1 a.d. by Paul, who never saw Jesus in person and knew no \ndetails of his life story. 11 \n\nThe details were accumulated through later adoption of the myths \nattached to every savior-god throughout the Roman empire. Like \nAdonis, Jesus was born of a consecrated temple maiden in the sacred \ncave of Bethlehem, "The House of Bread." 12 He was eaten in the \nform of bread, as were Adonis, Osiris, Dionysus, and others; he called \nhimself the bread of God (John 6:33). Like worshippers of Osiris, \nthose of Jesus made him part of themselves by eating him, so as to \nparticipate in his resurrection: "He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh \nmy blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him" (John 6:56). \n\nLike Attis, Jesus was sacrificed at the spring equinox and rose again \nfrom the dead on the third day, when he became God and ascended \nto heaven. Like Orpheus and Heracles, he "harrowed hell" and brought \na secret of eternal life, promising to draw all men with him up to glory \n(John 12:32). Like Mithra and all the other solar gods, he celebrated a \nbirthday nine months later at the winter solstice, because the day of \nhis death was also the day of his cyclic re-conception. See Attis. \n\nFrom the elder gods, Jesus acquired not only his title of Christos \nbut all his other titles as well. Osiris and Tammuz were called Good \nShepherd. Sarapis was Lord of Death and King of Glory. Mithra and \nHeracles were Light of the World, Sun of Righteousness, Helios the \nRising Sun. Dionysus was King of Kings, God of Gods. Hermes was \nthe Enlightened One and the Logos. Vishnu and Mithra were Son of \nMan and Messiah. Adonis was the Lord and the Bridegroom. Mot- \nAleyin was the Lamb of God. "Savior" (Soter) was applied to all of \nthem. \n\nMystery cults everywhere taught that ordinary men could be \npossessed by the spirits of such gods, and identified with them as \n"sons" or alter egos, as Jesus was. It was the commonly accepted way to \nacquire supernatural powers, as shown by some of the charms used \nby magicians: "Whatever I say must happen For I have taken to \n\n\n\n465 \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\n\n\nAulus Cornelius \nCelsus \n\nPatrician Roman \nscholar of the first \ncentury a.d., who wrote \nat length on the \nsubjects of medicine, \nagriculture, \nphilosophy, \njurisprudence, and \nreligion. \n\n\n\nmyself the power of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and of the great god- \ndemon Iao Ablanathanalba ... for 1 am the Son, I surpass the limit. . . . \nI am he who is in the seven heavens, who standeth in the seven \nsanctuaries; for I am the son of the living God. ... I have been united \nwith thy sacred form. I have been empowered by thy sacred name. I \nhave received the effluence of goodness, Lord, God of gods, King, \nDemon . . . having attained that nature equal to the God\'s." n \n\nThe skeptical Celsus noted that beggars and vagabonds throughout \nthe Empire were pretending to work miracles and become gods, \nthrowing fits, prophesying the end of the world, and aspiring to the \nstatus of saviors: \n\nEach has the convenient and customary spiel, "I am the god, " or "a son of \nGod, " or "a divine spirit, " and "I have come. For the world is about to \nbe destroyed, and you, men, because of your injustice, will go (with it). \nBut I wish to save, and you shall see me again coming back with \nheavenly power. Blessed is he who worships me now! On all others, both \ncities and countrysides, I shall cast eternal fire. And men who (now) \nignore their punishments shall repent in vain and groan, but those who \nbelieved in me I shall preserve immortal. " M \n\nOf course this "conspicuously false" doctrine was the central \nmessage of the Gospels too. Persian eschatology passing through a \nJewish-Essenic filter predicted "the Son of Man coming in a cloud \nwith power and great glory" (Luke 9:27, 21:27). Jesus promised the end \nof the world in his own generation. The rest of the Gospel material \nwas largely devoted to the miracles supposed to demonstrate his divine \npower, since religions generally "adduce revelations, apparitions, \nprophecies, miracles, prodigies and sacred mysteries that they may get \nthemselves valued and accepted." 1S Even these miracles were deriva- \ntive. Turning water into wine at Cana was copied from a Dionysian \nritual practiced at Sidon and other places. 16 In Alexandria the same \nDionysian miracle was regularly shown before crowds of the faithful, \nassisted by an ingenious system of vessels and siphons, invented by a \nclever engineer named Heron. 17 Many centuries earlier, priestesses at \nNineveh cured the blind with spittle, and the story was repeated of \nmany different gods and their incarnations. 18 Demeter of Eleusis \nmultiplied loaves and fishes in her role of Mistress of Earth and Sea. \nHealing the sick, raising the dead, casting out devils, handling poisonous \nserpents (Mark 16:18), etc., were so commonplace that Celsus \nscorned these "Christian" miracles as "nothing more than the common \nworks of those enchanters who, for a few oboli, will perform greater \ndeeds in the midst of the Forum. . . . The magicians of Egypt cast out \nevil spirits, cure diseases by a breath, and so influence some uncul- \ntured men, that they produce in them whatever sights and sounds they \nplease. But because they do such things shall we consider them the \nsons of God?" 19 \n\nMagicians often claimed that their prayers could bring flocks of \nsupernatural beings to their assistance. 20 Thus Jesus declared that his \n\n\n\n466 \n\n\n\n1 prayer could summon twelve legions (72,000) of guardian angels \n(Matthew 26:53). Magicians also communed with their followers by \nthe standard mystery-cult sacrament of bread-flesh and wine-blood. In \nI texts on magic, "a magician-god gives his own body and blood to a \nrecipient who, by eating it, will be united with him in love." 21 \n\nThe ability to walk on water was claimed by Far-Eastern holy men \nJ ever since Buddhist monks praised it as the mark of the true ascetic. 22 \nj The Magic Papyri said almost anyone could walk on water with the \nI help of "a powerful demon." 23 Impossibilities have always been the \nprops of religious credulity, as Tertullian admitted: "It is believable \nbecause it is absurd; it is certain because it is impossible." 24 \n\nHowever, repetitive miracles were not so believable as original \nones. Therefore early Christians insisted that all the older deities and \ntheir miracle-tales were invented by the devil, out of his foreknowledge \nof the true religion, so the faithful would be confused by past \n"imitations." 25 Pagan thinkers countered with the observation that \n"The Christian religion contains nothing but what Christians hold in \ncommon with heathens; nothing new, nor truly great." Even St. Augus- \ntine, finding the hypothesis of the devil\'s inventions hard to swallow, \nadmitted that "the true religion" was known to the ancients, and had \nexisted from the beginning of time, but it began to be called Christian \nafter "Christ came in the flesh." 26 \n\nNevertheless, adherents of the true religion violently disagreed \nas to the circumstances of its foundation. In the first few centuries a.d. \nthere were many mutually hostile Christian sects, and many mutually \ncontradictory Gospels. As late as 450, Bishop Theodore of Cyrrhus said \nthere were at least 200 different Gospels revered by the churches of \nhis own diocese, until he destroyed all but the canonical four. 27 The \nother Gospels were lost as stronger sects overwhelmed the weaker, \nwrecked their churches, and burned their books. 28 \n\nOne scripture, later thrown out of the canon, said Jesus was not \ncrucified. Simon of Cyrene suffered on the cross in his place, while \nJesus stood by laughing at the executioners, saying, "It was another . . . \nwho drank the gall and vinegar; it was not I ... it was another, \nSimon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. It was another upon whom \nthey placed the crown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height. . . . \nAnd I was laughing at their ignorance." 29 Believers in this scripture \nwere persecuted and forced to sign an abjuration reading: "I anathe- \nmatize those who say that Our Lord suffered only in appearance, and \nthat there was a man on the cross and another at a distance who \nlaughed." 30 \n\nSome Christians interpreted Jesus\'s noli me tangere ("Touch me \nnot") to mean he came back from death as an incorporeal spirit, after \nthe manner of other apotheosized heroes, such as the Irish hero \nLaegaire, who also told his people not to touch him. 31 Later, an \nunknown Gospel writer inserted the story of doubting Thomas, who \ninsisted on touching Jesus. This was to combat the heretical idea that \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Papyri \n\nCollections of \nexorcisms, invocations, \ncharms, and spells \nwidely circulated \nduring the early \nChristian era, used as \nbases for later \ngrimoires and \nHermetic texts. \n\n\n\n467 \n\n\n\nJesus Christ there was no resurrection in the flesh, and also to subordinate Jerusa- \n\nlem\'s municipal god Tammuz (Thomas) to the new savior (see \n\n^ m ^^^ Thomas, Saint). Actually, the most likely source of primary Christian \nmythology was the Tammuz cult in Jerusalem. Like Tammuz, Jesus \nwas the Bridegroom of the Daughter of Zion (John 12:1 5). Therefore \nhis bride was Anath, "Virgin Wisdom Dwelling in Zion," who was \nalso the Mother of God. 32 Her dove descended on him at his baptism, \nsignifying (in the old religion) that she chose him for the love-death. \nAnath broke her bridegroom\'s reed scepter, scourged him and pierced \nhim for fructifying blood. She pronounced his death curse, Mara- \nnatha (1 Corinthians 16:22). As the Gospels said of Jesus, Anath\'s \nbridegroom was "forsaken" by El, his heavenly father. 35 Jesus\'s cry to \nEl, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" seems to have \nbeen a line written for the second act of the sacred drama, the pathos \nor Passion (Mark 15:34). \n\nOf course this Passion was originally a sexual one. Jesus\'s last \nwords "It is consummated" (consummatum est) were interpreted as a \nsign that his work was finished, but could equally apply to his marriage \n(John 19:30). As a cross or pillar represented the divine phallus, so a \ntemple represented the body of the Goddess, whose "veil" (hymen) was \n"rent in the midst" as Jesus passed into death (Luke 23:45). As usual \nwhen the god disappeared into the underworld, the sun was eclipsed \n(Luke 23:44). In their ignorance of astronomical phenonema, Chris- \ntians claimed that the moon was full at the same time Easter is still a \nfull-moon festival though an eclipse of the sun can only occur at \nthe dark of the moon. 34 The full moon really meant impregnation of the \nGoddess. \n\nThe parting of Jesus\'s garment recalls the unwrapping of Osiris \nwhen he emerged from the tomb as the ithyphallic Min, "Husband \nof his Mother." If Jesus was one with his heavenly father, then he also \nmarried his mother and begot himself. A 4th-century scripture said in \nthe underworld he confronted his mother as Death, Mu} s She was also \nthe Bride disguised as Venus, the evening star, presiding over the \ndeath of the sun. Jews still recall her in a ritual greeting to the evening \nstar, "Come, O friend, let us welcome the Bride." 36 \n\nLike pagans, early Christians identified the Bride with the Mother. \nThey said Jesus "consummated on the cross" his union with Mary- \nEcclesia, his bride the church. Augustine wrote: "Like a bridegroom \nChrist went forth from his chamber, he went out with a presage of his \nnuptials. ... He came to the marriage bed of the cross, and there, in \nmounting it, he consummated his marriage . . . , he lovingly gave \nhimself up to the torment in place of his bride, and he joined himself to \nthe woman for ever." 37 John 19:41 says, "In the place where he was \ncrucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, \nwherein was never man yet laid." A garden was the conventional \nsymbol for the body of the mother/bride; and a new tomb was the virgin \nwomb, whence the god would be born again. On the third day, Jesus \n\n\n\n468 \n\n\n\nrose from the tomb/womb like Attis, whose resurrection was the Hilaria, Jesus Christ \n\nor Day of Joy. 38 Jesus\'s resurrection day was named after Eostre, the \n\nsame Goddess as Astarte, whom the Syrians called Mother Mari. 39 ^ -^_^__^__ \n\nThree incarnations of Mari, or Mary, stood at the foot of Jesus\'s \ni cross, like the Moerae of Greece. One was his virgin mother. The \nsecond was his "dearly beloved" (see Mary Magdalene). The third \nMary must have represented the Crone (the fatal Moera), so the \ntableau resembled that of the three Norns at the foot of Odin\'s sacrificial \ntree. The Fates were present at the sacrifices decreed by Heavenly \nFathers, whose victims hung on trees or pillars "between heaven and \nI earth." Up to Hadrian\'s time, victims offered to Zeus at Salamis were \nI anointed with sacred ointments thus becoming "Anointed Ones" or \n"Christs" then hung up and stabbed through the side with a \nspear. 40 Nothing in Jesus\'s myth occurred at random; every detail was \npart of a formal sacrificial tradition, even to the "procession of palms" \nwhich glorified sacred kings in ancient Babylon. 41 \n\nFar-Eastern traditions were utilized too. The Roman empire was \nwell aware of the teachings and myths of Buddhism. Buddha images \nin classic Greek style were made in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the first \ncentury a.d. 42 Buddhist ideas like the "footprints of Buddha" ap- \npeared among Christians. Bishop Sulpicius of Jerusalem reported that, \nas in India, "In the dust where Christ trod the marks of His step can \n| still be seen, and the earth still bears the print of His feet." 43 Buddhist \nmetaphors and phrasing also appeared in the Gospels. Jesus\'s formu- \nla, "Dearly Beloved," was the conventional way for Tantric deities to \naddress their teachings to Devi, their Goddess. 44 \n\nScholars\' efforts to eliminate paganism from the Gospels in order \nto find a historical Jesus have proved as hopeless as searching for a \ncore in an onion. 45 Like a mirage, the Jesus figure looks clear at a \ndistance but lacks approachable solidity. "His" sayings and parables \ncame from elsewhere; "his" miracles were old twice-told tales. Even the \nLord\'s Prayer was a collection of sayings from the Talmud, many \nderived from earlier Egyptian prayers to Osiris. 46 The Sermon on the \nMount, sometimes said to contain the essence of Christianity, had no \noriginal material; it was made up of fragments from Psalms, Ecclesiastes, \nIsaiah, Secrets of Enoch, and the Shemone Esreh. 47 Moreover, it was \nunknown to the author of the oldest Gospel, pseudo-Mark. 48 \n\nThe discovery that the Gospels were forged, centuries later than \nthe events they described, is still not widely known even though the \nCatholic Encyclopedia admits, "The idea of a complete and clear-cut \ncanon of the New Testament existing from the beginning . . . has no \nfoundation in history." No extant manuscript can be dated earlier than \nthe 4th century a.d.; most were written even later. 49 The oldest \nmanuscripts contradict one another, as also do even the present canon \nof synoptic Gospels. \n\nThe church owed its canon to the Gnostic teacher Marcion, who \nfirst collected Pauline epistles about the middle of the 2nd century. \n\n\n\n469 \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\n\n\nPorphyry (ca. 234- \n305 a.d.) Neoplatonist \nphilosopher, scholar, \nand writer; biographer \nof Plotinus;an \nopponent of the \nChristian church, \nwhich eventually \ndestroyed most of his \nbooks. \n\nSynoptic Gospels \n\nThe first three books of \nthe New Testament \n(Matthew, Mark, \nLuke), which differ \nradically from the \nmaterial in the so- \ncalled "Gnostic" \nGospel of John. \n\nJulius Wellhausen \n\n(1844-1918) German \nOld Testament \nscholar, a leader of the \n"higher criticism" \nmovement. \n\n\n\nLater he was excommunicated as a heretic because he denied that the \nscriptures were mystical allegories full of magic words of power. The \nepistles he collected were already over a century old, if indeed they were \nwritten by Paul; much of their material was made up of forged \ninterpolations. 50 \n\nThe most "historical" figure in the Gospels was Pontius Pilate, to \nwhom Jesus was presented as "king" of the Jews and simultaneously \nas a criminal deserving the death penalty for "blasphemy" because he \ncalled himself Christ, Son of the Blessed (Luke 23:3; Mark 14:61- \n64). This alleged crime was no real crime. Eastern provinces swarmed \nwith self-styled Christs and Messiahs, calling themselves Sons of God \nand announcing the end of the world. None of them was executed for \n"blasphemy." 51 The beginning of the story probably lay in the \ntradition of sacred-king sacrifice in Jerusalem long before Pilate\'s admin- \nistration, when Rome was trying to discourage such barbarisms. \n\nFrom 103 to 76 B.C., Jerusalem was governed by Alexander \nJanneaus, called the Aeon, who defended his throne by fighting \nchallengers. One year, on the Day of Atonement, his people attacked \nhim at the altar, waving palm branches to signify that he should die \nfor the earth\'s fertility. Alexander declined the honor and instituted a \npersecution of his own subjects. Another king of Jerusalem took the \nname of Menelaus, "Moon-king," and practiced the rite of sacred \nmarriage in the temple. 52 Herod also made a sacred marriage, and \nhad John the Baptist slain as a surrogate for himself. \n\nIf there was a Jesus cult in Jerusalem after 30 a.d., it completely \ndisappeared forty years later when Titus conquered the city and \noutlawed many local customs, including human sacrifice. Jerusalem was \nwholly Romanized under Hadrian. It was newly named Aelia Capito- \nlina and rededicated to the Goddess. The temple became a shrine of \nVenus. 53 Tacitus described the siege of Jerusalem, but his writing is \nabruptly cut off at the moment when Roman forces entered the city as \nif the final chapters were deliberately destroyed so no one knows \nwhat the Romans found there. However, Romans did express disap- \nproval of the Jews\' or Christians\' cannibalistic sacraments. Porphyry \ncalled it "absurd beyond all absurdity, and bestial beyond every sort of \nbestiality, that a man should taste human flesh and drink the blood of \nmen of his own genus and species, and by doing should have eternal \nlife." 54 \n\nFrom the Christians\' viewpoint, a real historical Jesus was essential \nto the basic premise of the faith: the possibility of immortality through \nidentification with his own death and resurrection. Wellhausen rightly \nsaid Jesus would have no place in history unless he died and returned \nexactly as the Gospels said. 55 "If Christ hath not been raised, your faith \nis vain" (1 Corinthians 15:17). Still, despite centuries of research, no \nhistorical Jesus has come to light. It seems his story was not merely \noverlaid with myth; it was mythic to the core. \n\nLike all myths, it revealed much about the collective psychology \nthat created it. In earlier pagan religions, the Mother and Son \n\n\n\n470 \n\n\n\nperiodically ousted the Father from his heavenly throne. The divine son Jesus Christ \n\nbf Christianity no longer challenged the heavenly king, but tamely \n\nsubmitted to his fatal command: "Not my will, but thine, be done" ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n([Luke 22:42). Some early sects said the Father who demanded his \nkon\'s blood was cruel, even demonic. 56 These were suppressed, but \nScholars have discerned in Christianity "an original attitude of hostil- \nity toward the father figure, which was changed in the first two Christian \npenturies into an attitude of passive masochistic docility." 57 \n\nIf orthodox Christianity demanded subordination of the Son, it was \nfeven more determined to subordinate the Mother. The Gospels\' \njlesus showed little respect for his mother, which troubled the church in \nIts Renaissance efforts to attract women to the cult of Mary. "Any \nhero who speaks to his mother only twice, and on both occasions \nAddresses her as \'Woman,\' is a difficult figure for the sentimental \nbiographers." 58 Together with Jesus\'s avowed opposition to marriage \nind the family (Matthew 22:30; Luke 14:26), women\'s primary \nconcerns, New Testament sexism tended to disgust educated women of \n[he pagan world. \n\nBut the Jesus who emulated Buddha in advocating poverty and \nhumility eventually became the mythic figurehead for one of the \nworld\'s pre-eminent money-making organizations. The cynical Pope \nLeo X exclaimed, "What profit has not that fable of Christ brought \nIs!" 59 \n\nModern theologians tend to sidestep the question of whether Jesus \n(vas in fact a fable or a real person. In view of the complete dearth of \nhard evidence, and the dubious nature of the soft evidence, it seems \nChristianity is based on the ubiquitous social phenomena of credulity: \n\nAn idea is able to gain and retain the aura of essentia] truth through telling \nand retelling. This process endows a cherished notion with more \nveracity than a library of facts. . . . [DJocumentation plays only a small role \nin contrast to the act of re-confirmation by each generation of scholars. \nIn addition, the further removed one gets from the period in question, the \ngreater is the strength of the conviction. Initial incredulousness is soon \nconverted into belief in a probability and eventually smug assurance. 60 \n\nI. H. Smith, 19V 2. Albright, 262. 3. Fra/er, G.B., 341. 4. Graves, G.M. 1, 89. \n\n5.

Apart from its purely sexual meaning, there were many \ncorollary ideas, such as: (1) the spark of life, or fetus (bindu) \nconceived within the Mother of Creation; (2) the dead body enclosed in \nthe womb of Mother Earth; (3) the eternal orgasm of Shiva the jewel \nand Kali the lotus in their cosmic sexual dance; (4) the sleeping god, \nbetween reincarnations, cradled in the Lotus of his Mother. Another \nword for the male "jewel" was vajra, meaning phallus, gem, spark of \nlife, and bolt of lightning. 1 \n\nl.Rawson, E.A.,151. \n\n\n\nJews, Persecution of \n\nIllogically, Christians justified persecutions of Jews by calling them \n"Christ-killers," though their own theology said God had decreed \nChrist\'s death; therefore the Jews only obeyed the will of God. \nGospel passages interpolated after the church\'s rise to power in Rome \nabsolved Pilate of guilt because he represented the Holy City. The \nJews were condemned by the ancient liturgical phrase copied into the \nGospel, which used to invoke the fertilizing power of a god\'s blood \nbut was later interpreted as an acceptance of blood guilt: "His blood be \non us, and on our children" (Matthew 27:23-25). \n\nThis pious forgery became the foundation for centuries of persecu- \ntions, culminating even in the present century with the extermination \nof millions of Jews under the Nazi regime, the latest in a two-thousand- \nyear history of pogroms. \n\nUp to the middle of the 14th century the free city of Cologne \nremained a haven for Jewish merchants, weavers\' guilds, and other \ncommercial enterprises, resisting domination by the church. Then \nCatholic forces moved in; Jewish merchants were burned alive in \ntheir houses with their wives and children; those who escaped the \nimmolation were banished. Their property remained in Christian \nhands, with 50 percent going to the victorious archbishop. 1 \n\nThe great plagues of the 14th century were usually attributed to \nthe Jews, said to cause the pestilence by poisoning wells and streams \nwith a combination of holy wafers stolen from the churches and the \nmenstrual blood of Jewish women. Each wave of plague brought a \nwave of massacre of Jewish communities. In 1382, rioters looted and \nvandalized the Jewish quarter in Paris. 2 In 1 391 , the Archdeacon of \nSeville instigated a "Holy War against the Jews." Mobs stormed the \nghetto, tore down synagogues, and murdered an estimated 41,000 \npersons. 5 Twelve thousand Jews perished in Bavaria at the time of the ] \nBlack Death; two thousand were burned at Strasbourg for causing the \' \n\n\n\n472 \n\n\n\nplague of 1 348; at Chinon an immense trench was dug and filled with Jews, Persecution of \n\nblazing wood to burn 160 Jews in a single day. 4 \n\nThe church encouraged persecution of Jews to divert attention ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nfrom the developing idea that these terrible plagues, which killed \nabout half of Europe\'s population before the end of the century, were \ncaused by a malicious God. The pope himself referred in a bull to \n"the pestilence with which God is afflicting the Christian people." The \nhorrors of the plague revived Gnostic opinions of the evil Jehovah. \nOne professor wrote: "The hostility of God is stronger than the hostility \nof man." 5 \n\nThe real cause of the plagues was the Christian commerce with \nthe Holy Land. Crusaders\' ships carried millions of Oriental black \nrats, with their fleas, the true carriers of the plague bacillus. 6 Being \nignorant of this, Christian authorities made no effort to control the \nrats but tried to exterminate Jews instead. Jew-killing probably served to \nIvent some of the popular resentment of clergymen, who behaved \npadly during the plagues. Most deserted their flocks in haste to leave \nplague-stricken areas. Churchmen generally were accused of "panic \nfear and neglect." 7 \n\nPersecutions were supported by many made-to-order myths. In \n[Spain, the popular myth of the ritual murder was combined with the \njmyth of plague-magic to give Torquemada his excuse to expel the Jews \nfrom the country in 1490 and take their property for the enrichment \npf the church. Some Jews were arrested and tortured until they \nconfessed having stolen a consecrated host and kidnapped a four- \nvear-old boy called Santo Nino (Holy Child) from the doorway of a \nchurch. They gave the child five thousand lashes, crowned him with \nthorns, and extracted his heart to make anti-Christian magic. All Jewry \nwas involved in this plot to destroy Christendom by black magic, the \nconfessions said. Jews planned to kidnap Christian children and use \nmeir hearts or blood or ashes to make charms which, thrown into \nrivers and wells, would make all Christians sick. \n\nIt was said Santo Nino bore his sufferings with great serenity, and \npen directed the Jews in the removal of his heart. The child\'s blind \npother miraculously recovered her sight at the moment of his death (an \nInterpolated allegory of Judaism receiving enlightenment by the \nHeath of Christ, perhaps). The Holy Child went directly to heaven, \nwhich accounted for the authorities\' inability to find his remains \nwhere the Jews said they were buried. 8 \n\nThis mythic porridge started the expulsion of thousands of Jews \nfrom Spain and Christian seizure of their assets. In 1260 the Jewish \npopulation of Toledo had built "the largest and most beautiful syna- \ngogue in Spain." In the 1 5th century the Jews of Toledo were \nmassacred and the synagogue appropriated by the church. It now bears \nIhe name of the Church of Santa Maria la Blanca. 9 According to \nContemporary theologians, persecution and seizure of property was a \nlegitimate activity of Catholic powers. In their view, "no illegitimate \n\n\n\n473 \n\n\n\nJews, Persecution of violence was being done to the Jews, infidels, and heretics put to the \nsword at the behest of the Church: these people had no rights to be \n^ mmmmmamm ^^^^ violated. " \' \n\nThe legend of Santo Nino was not even an original invention of \nthe Spanish Inquisition. The same legend had been used two \ncenturies earlier to stimulate a persecution of Jews in the Rhineland. \nThe German child-martyr\'s name was Werner. He was kidnapped, \ntortured, and sacrificed to the Jewish God. His mutilated body was \nfound in a river, and a church was built over his tomb at Bacharach. 1 \' \nIn 1322, eighteen Swabian Jews were slain at Ehingen for stealing a \nconsecrated host from a church. Later it was discovered that the Jews \nwere innocent, and the real culprit was a Christian woman who was \nsubsequently burned for witchcraft. 12 \n\nJews and women were almost equally serviceable as scapegoats for \nthe evils of medieval life; but women were more detested than Jews, \naccording to a decree of Orvieto in 1 350. This law said if a man and \nwoman became involved in a love affair, one of them Christian and \nthe other Jewish, the woman in the case, of whichever faith, must be \nbeheaded or burned alive. 13 \n\nOften, anti-Semitism went to such lengths that Christian authori- \nties even denied the origin of their own religion from a Jewish matrix. \nOpposing a papal aspirant of Jewish ancestry, St. Bernard wrote: "It \nwould be an insult to Christ if the offspring of a Jew occupied the \nthrone of Peter." H Bernard seems to have wholly forgotten his own \nchurch\'s teaching that Peter himself was a Jew, as were all the other \napostles and Jesus as well. The Jews didn\'t press the point, since the \nformer Jewishness of Christ or Peter made no difference in the \npolitical situation. \n\nAnti-Semitism reached an apogee under the rule of Adolf Hitler in \nour own century. Hitler made the Jews wear yellow badges, like \nmedieval heretics. A German Christian organization announced in \n1937, "Hitler\'s word is God\'s law." 15 Hitler said: \n\nMy feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It \npoints me to the man who once, in loneliness, surrounded by only a \nfew followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned \nmen to fight against them and who, God\'s truth! was greatest not as a \nsufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love, as a Christian and as a man, I \nread through the passage which tells us how the Lord rose at last in His \nmight and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of \nvipers and adders. How terrific was the fight for the world against the \nJewish poison. \' 6 \n\nEvidently Hitler was not much of a reader. He never got to the \npart that designated Jesus the Bridegroom of Zion; nor did he seem to \nknow who owned the Temple. \n\nI. Agrippa, 19. 2. Tuchman, 380. 3. Coulton, 288. 4. White 2, 73. \n5.

In \n43 1, aged only 19, she was burned as a witch at Rouen, wearing a \nlacard that said: "Relapsed, Heretic, Apostate, Idolator." 4 Ecclesiasti- \nal authorities never did explain the nature of her "idols." The \nxecutioner pretended to find her heart unburned in the ashes, to sell it \np a holy relic. 5 \n\nFor 500 years Joan remained a popular national heroine until she \n[as finally canonized by Pope Benedict XV in 1920. To the church \nif her own time this would have been unthinkable. "The Church, \n[alous of her pagan authority over pagan soldiers; and jealous, too, of \ner success-based popularity with the masses; needed no urging by the \nInglish to see Joan as \'dispensable.\' It was the Church which tried \n[nd condemned her; the Church which regarded her rightly, of \npurse as an enemy; and the Church was glad to get rid of her." 6 \npnically, the same church that pronounced Joan a witch and had her \n|lled, now claims her as a saint. \n\n1.

Even the church accepted Joan\'s \nipntificate as historical fact, up to the beginning of the 17th century. \nler portrait appeared in a row of papal busts in Siena Cathedral, labeled \nlAannes VIII, femina ex Anglia: John VIII, an Englishwoman. 1 \n\nPope Joan was first mentioned by her contemporary, Anastasius \nje Librarian (d. 886). Scotus\'s chronicle of the popes listed her: \nluD. 854, Lotharii 14, Joanna, a woman, succeeded Leo, and reigned \nwo years, five months, and four days." De Gemblours\'s chronicle \n\n\n\n475 \n\n\n\nJoan, Pope said, "It is reported that this John was a female, and that she conceived \n\nby one of her servants. The Pope, becoming pregnant, gave birth to a \n^^^^^^^^^^_ child, wherefor some do not number her among the Pontiffs." Thomas \nde Elmham\'s official list of the popes said: "a.d. 855, Joannes. This \none doesn\'t count; she was a woman." 2 \n\nPapal historian and Vatican librarian Platina wrote in The Lives of \nthe Popes that Joan was English, that she knew more of the scriptures \nthan any man, and that she was elected pope by disguising herself in \nmen\'s clothes and making herself a "monk" noted for scholarship. \nHer deception was revealed when her labor pains came on her, and she \ndied in a street between the Lateran and St. Clement\'s church. 3 She \nwas dragged into the street and stoned to death and buried there in an \nunmarked grave. 4 Martin Polonus said the street was ever afterward \navoided by papal processions, "out of detestation for what happened \nthere. Nor on that account is she placed in the catalogue of Holy \nPontiffs, not only on account of her sex, but also because of the \nhorribleness of the circumstances." 5 \n\nJoan (or John) was the only pope ever stricken from papal records, \nalthough her pontificate was better documented than many others, \nespecially the popes before the 4th or 5 th centuries, many of whom had \nno contemporary documentation at all but were mere names inserted \ninto later chronicles to create an illusion of unbroken succession. \n\nThe official story now is that there was an "antipope" named John, \nenthroned by popular demand against the will of the clergy, and soon \noverthrown. 6 But church historians were seldom trustworthy. In 1 886, \nEmmanuel Royidis published Joan\'s biography, Papissa Joanna, stat- \ning in his introduction: "Every sentence in my book and almost every \nphrase is based on the testimony of contemporary authors." The \nchurch immediately banned his book and excommunicated him. 7 \n\nPope Joan may not have been so apocryphal as she is now \nportrayed. Part of the church\'s most carefully hidden history shows \nthat there were women in high ecclesiastical positions up to the 12th \ncentury, when they began to be deposed. Abbesses in Germany and \nFrance once held episcopal powers and the title of Sacerdos Maxima: \nHigh Priestess. At Quedlinburg, the scene of particularly intense \nwitch persecutions, the abbesses once controlled all religious orders and \nthe whole town, having titles of Superior Canoness of the Cathedral, \nMetropolitana (Mayor), and Matriarch. 8 \n\nIn Milan during early Renaissance times, dual cathedrals of the \nmonks of St. John and the canonesses of St. Maria Maggiore seem to \nhave been devoted to worship of the female principle after the manner j \nof the Order of Fontevrault, whose monks "took vows of obedience \nto the abbess in imitation of the obedience of Jesus to his mother." The \nMilanese nuns bore the title of Sancta Dei Genetrix Holy Mother \nof God. 9 \n\nFrom Milan came a sect devoted to an unofficial papess named \nGuglielma, whose followers "believed she was incarnation of the \n\n\n\n476 \n\n\n\nj Holy Spirit." Her Second Coming was predicted, and she was reincar- Joan, Pope \n\nl nated in a lady named Manfreda or Maifreda, whose votaries said \n\n"the male dominated Papacy would pass away, yielding to a line of ^^^^^^^^_^_ \n\nfemale Popes. In preparation for this event they elected Sister \n| Manfreda the first of the Popesses, and several wealthy families of \nLombardy provided at great cost the sacred vessels they expected her \nto use when she said Mass in Rome at the Church of Santa Maria \nMaggiore." But the sect was exterminated by the Inquisition, and \nManfreda was burned at the stake in the year 1300. 10 Some die-hards \nI claimed she was later reincarnated as the Fairy Queen. 11 \n\nThere were other women in history close to the papal office who \nI may have contributed to the legends of the Papess. Gibbon suggested \nI the period in the 1 Oth century when Rome was ruled by two women of \nthe house of Theophylact, Theodora and her daughter Marozia, both \nqueens and sacred harlots, bearing the title oisenatrix. "The most \nstrenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and \ntheir reign may have suggested to darker ages the fable of a female pope. \nThe bastard son, the grandson, and the great grandson of Marozia \na rare genealogy were seated on the Chair of St. Peter." \n\nLiudprand, bishop of Cremona, said it differently: "A certain \n|shameless strumpet called Theodora at one time was sole monarch of \nRome and shame though it is to write it exercised power like a man. \nShe had two daughters, Marozia and Theodora, who were not only \nher equals but could surpass her in the exercises that Venus loves." \nTheodora\'s lover, Bishop John of Ravenna, was given the papacy: \n"Theodora, like a harlot fearing that she would have few opportunities \nlof bedding with her sweetheart, forced him to abandon his bishopric \nend take for himself O, monstrous crime! the Papacy of Rome." 12 \nflorin didn\'t seem to need forcing. He became Pope John X in 914, \nput Marozia deposed him in 928 and threw him into a dungeon in the \nIcastle of Sant\' Angelo, where he died. Three years later she gave the \npapal throne to the son she had borne to Pope Sergius. 13 \n\nFrom time to time, other women exerted significant influence on \nthe papacy. Pope John XXII had so many mistresses that it was said \npe turned the Lateran palace into a brothel. He made his favorite one of \nthe most powerful feudal baronesses in Italy, "for he was so blindly in \n; love with her that he made her governor of cities and even gave to her \nthe golden crosses and cups of St. Peter himself." When Pope \n[Klexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) left Rome to visit his son Cesare, he left \n| pis daughter Lucretia Borgia in charge. Another woman who com- \njfnanded popes was Catherine Benincasa of Siena, who convinced Pope \nCregory XI that she had a mandate from God to order his papacy \nmoved from Avignon back to Rome. 14 \n\nBut the real papess, if there was one, belonged to an earlier era \nhan these an era of untrustworthy, disconnected records, often \nDestroyed by social upheavals and wars. A popular fairy tale, "The \n[Flounder in the Sea," began as a hostile allegory of the papess. A \n\n\n\n477 \n\n\n\nJocasta \nJonah \n\n\n\nmagic flounder granted the wishes of the ambitious wife of a fisherman; \nfirst she wished to become wealthy, then noble; she wanted to be a \nking, then a pope. Finally she wanted to become God, and hubris \ncaused her downfall. The fisherman in the story was naturally St. \nPeter, bridegroom of the church (Lady Ecclesia); the miraculous fish \nwith the power to create popes but not God represented Christ. 15 \nThe moral of the story was the common anti-feminist opinion that \nwomen were more easily corrupted by political power than men. \n\nSeventeenth-century England freely circulated the original story of \nPope Joan to cast opprobrium on the "papists." A London pamphlet \nshowed her in papal robes and tiara, her child appearing from beneath \nher skirt, with the verse: \n\nA Woman Pope (as History doth tell) \n\nIn High Procession, She in Labour fell, \n\nAnd was Delivered of a Bastard Son; \n\nThence, Rome some call the Whore of Babylon. \' 6 \n\nThe Papess of the Tarot cards was often called Pope Joan. \nWhen the first Tarot decks were being produced, Joan\'s pontificate was \nuniversally accepted as historical fact. The card-Papess\'s three-tiered \ntiara was the same as the headdress shown on engravings of Pope \nJoan. 17 However, less than a century later, French card painters were \nafraid to set a woman on the papal throne even symbolically. They \n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanged the Papess to Juno in a classic chlamys. A Belgian Tarot \neven transformed her into a man, labeled "the Spaniard." 18 \n\nWhether Pope Joan really existed or not, a curious Vatican custom \narose in the wake of her legend. Candidates for the papacy had to seat \nthemselves naked on an open stool, to be viewed through a hole in the \nfloor by cardinals in the room below. The committee had to make its \nofficial announcement: Testiculos habet et bene pendentes, "he has \ntesticles, and they hang all right." 19 It seemed important that "Holy \nMother Church" must never be governed by a Holy Mother. \n\n1.

Medieval saintmakers adapted the story of \nBuddha\'s early life to their own fictions, calling the father of St. Josa- \nphat "an Indian king" who kept the young saint confined to prevent \nhim from becoming a Christian. 1 He was converted anyway, and \nproduced the usual assortment of miracles, some of them copied \nfrom incidents in the life story of Buddha. St. Josaphat enjoyed great \npopularity in the Middle Ages, an ironical development in a Europe \nthat abhorred Buddhism as a work of the devil. \n\nl.Attwater, 58. \n\n\n\n;eph \n\nie Gospel of Mark, oldest of the synoptic Gospels, never men- \n\n>ned Joseph. Jesus is "the son of Mary" (Mark 6:3), and of Mary only. \n\nThe Gospel of Matthew gives a long genealogy of paternal \nicestors to prove Jesus a descendant of David through his father \n| Joseph. Then, the verses immediately following make nonsense of the \nwhole genealogy by declaring that Jesus was not Joseph\'s son at all. \nAn early translation of the New Testament however, the Codex \nSinaiticus, stated: "Joseph begat Jesus." \' \n\nThe Gospel of Luke calls Joseph a son of Heli, i.e., of Helios, the \nsun (Luke 3:23). Jesus called Eli, or Elias, his "father" who forsook \nhim when he was crucified (Matthew 27:46; Mark 1 5:34). Jesus was \nlater identified with the same "father." A sect of Gaulish Christians \nworshipped Christ as Helios, calling themselves Heliognosti. 2 The solar \neclipse at Jesus\'s death, his titles of Light of the World and Sun of \nRighteousness, were taken from cults of the solar hero, as were his \nvirgin birth and his mortal pseudo-father who didn\'t lie with his wife \nuntil she brought forth her Divine Child, son of the sun. ? \n\nThe Christian legend of Joseph\'s rod said he was chosen to be \nMary\'s husband, out of a group of suitors, by a symbolic test of \nfertility. All candidates laid their (phallic) rods on the (female-symbolic) \naltar. Joseph\'s rod alone burst into bloom, a proof of magical potency. \nThe sacred dove of Aphrodite came down from heaven and perched on \nJoseph\'s rod, signifying that the Goddess accepted him. 4 The same \ndove appeared later over the head of Jesus at his baptism, with the same \nI implication of acceptance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n479 \n\n\n\nJoseph \n\n\n\nProtoevangelium, \n\nalso known as the \nRevelation of James: \na Gospel written in the \nsecond century A.D., \nvalued by early church \nfathers as authentic \nbut eventually \neliminated from the \n\n\n\nThe story of the flowering rod (virility) was common in Middle- \nEastern mythologies; rods were also interchangeable with serpents, \nbecause of the phallic significance of both (Exodus 7:12). The flowering \nrod was also a magic talisman for Tannhauser, who proved the \nvalidity of his pagan faith against the pope with a rod that burst into \nbloom. This rod came from the mountain sanctuary of the Goddess \nVenus and represented Tannhauser as her lover. 5 \n\nThe Goddess was incarnate in a queen in Tannhauser\'s case, \n"Queen Sybil"; in the parallel case of Thomas Rhymer, the Fairy \nQueen; in the case of the biblical Joseph, Mariamne, Queen of \nJerusalem, embodiment of the Goddess Mari. There was a Joseph \nwho espoused temple maidens at Herod\'s court, but was slain after he \nlay with the queen, Mariamne, or Miriam, or Mary. 6 \n\nThe priestly name of Joseph may have been bestowed on Jewish \ncounterparts of the priests known in Egypt as "fathers of the god." 7 \nThe function of such holy men was to beget, on the temple maidens, \nchildren who would be sacer: firstborn "sons of God" dedicated to \nthe service of the deity. The Protoevangelium says the virgin Mary was \nsuch a temple maiden; she also bore the name of the Queen and the \nGoddess, as well as the holy harlot who was high priestess of the sacred \ndrama. 8 The mythic proliferation of Marys and Josephs indicates that \nthese were not personal names but characters in the drama: the chosen \nhusband who was yet not a husband; the father-of-God who was yet \nnot a father; the virgin-mother-Goddess-priestess-queen who was also a \nkadesha or "Bride of God." 9 \n\nIt can be shown that Joseph was indeed a divine name in Israel. \nThe Egyptian form was Djoser or Tcheser, a deified pharaoh long \nassociated in both Egyptian and Hebrew tradition with the seven-year \nfamine along the Nile. 10 Palestine had a town dedicated to Joseph-El, \nor "Joseph the God," possibly the same Egyptian god-king. 11 Certainly \nthe Old Testament Joseph was "chosen" by the Goddess who \ninspired divinatory interpretation of dreams, called Nanshe by the \nBabylonians. 12 Dream interpretation was the specialty of the Old \nTestament Joseph in his role of Egyptian wizard-priest associated, like \nDjoser, with the seven-year famine. A multicolored vestment was the \nmark of oneiromantic wizard-priests in Babylon, which probably ex- \nplains Joseph\'s celebrated coat of many colors (Genesis 37:23). \n\nJoseph\'s sojourn in the Pit would naturally have taken place \nbefore, not after, he was awarded the coat. His "brothers" (fellow \npriests?) lowered him into the abaton for a death-and-rebirth ritual, such \nas Assyrian and Babylonian priests underwent before they emerged \nfrom the Pit reborn into a holy life. 13 After such an initiation, Joseph \nwas inspired not only to interpret dreams; he also practiced divination | \nwith the aid of a silver cup (Genesis 44:5), the vessel of the Goddess, \nmade of moon-metal. (See Abaddon.) \n\nAnother biblical Joseph associated with the Christian sacred drama, \nand a divine cup, was Joseph of Arimathea, literally "a Joseph \n\n\n\n480 \n\n\n\nbelonging to the Goddess-mother Ari," or Mari, she who made men Jove \n\n(arya) out of clay. 14 This Joseph was a "counselor" of Jerusalem, that Judas \n\nis, a priest; he supervised Jesus\'s burial. Later myths said the same ^ ^^^^_.^__ \n\nJoseph carried to England the divine sexual symbols of a (male) \nflowering rod and a (female) cup or Grail of sacred blood. Several \nwomen named Mary accompanied him. The holy articles were \nenshrined at Glastonbury, formerly named Caer Wydyr, an omphalic \nseat of the union between pagan God and Goddess. 15 Rod and cup \nwere reinterpreted in a Christian context by the legends of the Holy \nGrail at Glastonbury. However, mystical systems such as the Tarot \nsuits of rods and cups suggest that these were none other than male- \nfemale elemental symbols given a Christian gloss (see Grail, Holy). \n\n1. H.

Juno the \nMother and Minerva the wise Crone remained; but Juventas the Virgin \ngave way to a young god, just as Hebe the virgin form of the Greek \nTriple Goddess gave way to the youth Ganymede. See Trinity. \n\n\n\nJudas \n\nAs the Christian figure of the Betrayer, Judas was poorly understood. \nFormerly, Judas was an ancestral god, father of the nation of Judah and \nof Jews (Judaei). As Jude, or Jeud, he was the "only-begotten son" of \nthe Divine Father Isra-El. 1 Judas was a dynastic name for priest-kings of \nJudea for a hundred years after Judas Maccabeus restored ancient \nsacrificial customs to the temple of Jerusalem in 165 B.C. 2 Thus the \nkingly name of Judas was commonly given victims sacrificed as \nsurrogates for a reigning monarch. \n\nJudas\'s legend parallels those of many Other sacred kings. He was \nborn of a holy woman named Cyboread, a prophetess or priestess. He \nwas sent out to sea in a chest (cista), which washed up on the isle of \nScariot hence his name, Judas Iscariot. The queen of the island \nraised him, as the princess of Egypt raised Moses. When he came of \nage, Judas returned home to take service at Pilate\'s court. Like \nOedipus, he killed his father and married his mother. Early Christians \nsaid Judas joined the disciples of Jesus in order to be cleansed of this \nsin. 3 \n\nThe Syrian Acts of Thomas declares however that Judas was \n\n\n\n\n\n\n481 \n\n\n\nJudas Jesus\'s twin brother, whose full name was Judas Thomas, i.e., "Judas \n\nthe Tammuz." Passages of the Koran insist that Judas had the same face \nm ^ m t^^^^mi^mm as J esus an< ^ v/as crucified in his stead. 4 Judas\'s qualifications as a \n\nsacrificial Savior hint that he might have combined with Jesus at some \npoint in early Christianity as an alternate seasonal god, like Horus and \nSet in Egypt. \n\nThe Gospels are vague and contradictory about Judas\'s death. \nMatthew says he hanged himself (27:5). Acts 1:18 says he died of a \nfall, which made him "burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels \ngushed out." Hanging and disemboweling were both common forms \nof ritual killing; but the ritualistic nature of Judas\'s death is most strongly \nsuggested by its location: Aceldama, the Field of Blood, dedicated to \n"the Potter in the House of the Lord," who received Judas\'s blood- \nmoney. \n\nThe Gospel writer naively admitted that the detail about the \nmoney that bought Jesus was inserted only to fulfill a "prophecy" in \nZechariah 11: "So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And \n\nthe Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter And I took the \n\nthirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the \nLord." The Potter in the temple was an image of the Great Goddess \nArum, "The Potter," a title of Ishtar or Astarte or Ninhursag who made \nmankind of clay moistened with blood. The Potter\'s Field was clay, \nperiodically soaked with blood to restore to the Goddess some of the \nlife-essence she bestowed. 5 \n\nGospel stories contradict each other concerning this field. One \nwriter said Judas purchased the field with his thirty pieces of silver \n(Acts 1:18). Another said he "repented" and took the money back to \nthe temple, where he flung it down, and the priests used it to buy \n"the potter\'s field, to bury strangers in" (Matthew 27:7). \n\nThe story of Judas\'s "betrayal" of Jesus is particularly confusing; \nwhy would anyone need to point Jesus out, when he had already \nentered the city as the central figure in a triumphal procession, playing \nthe part of the Bridegroom of Zion, calling himself the son of God, \npublicly conversing with angels, and publicly promising all men a share \nin his imminent resurrection (John 12: 15, 29, 32)? In fact the \nmonetary payment and the "betrayal" seem to have been necessary \nparts of the traditional drama, devices to absolve the executioners of \nguilt. \n\nIt might be supposed that when Jesus received Judas\'s kiss, he \nbecame a sacred king of the Judaei. He was "betrayed" by the spirit \nof the eleventh hour, who in the solar cults announced the coming \ndeath of the Light of the World in the twelfth hour which is why \nthe eleventh hour still presages something dire. Because of the kiss, it \nwas sometimes assumed that Judas was "the disciple whom Jesus \nloved" though Gospels later removed from the canon said Jesus loved \nMary Magdalene more than any of his male followers. 6 The much- \ndiscussed passage in John 2 1 was a remnant of sun worship, with which \nthe Gospel of John was generally permeated: \n\n\n\n482 \n\n\n\nPeter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; Juggernaut \n\nwhich also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he \n\nthat betrayeth thee? Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthis man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what \n\nis that to thee? \n\nTwelve disciples signified the twelve hours of the day: "Are \nthere not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he \nstumbleth not, because he seeth the light of the world" (John 1 1:9). \nThe disciple of the last hour, who leaned on the breast of the sun at his \nsetting, was the evening star, often called Shalem or Shalom, \n"peace," because he betrayed the solar deity into his nightly death and \nspoke the Word of Farewell to him: salaam, Peace. The Jews\' solar \nking died at Jerusalem, "the House of Peace." \n\nThe ancients knew the evening star and morning star were one \nand the same, the planet Venus. So the same "disciple" who \nbetrayed the sun god into the land of death was also the one who tarried \nuntil he rose again in the morning, the last star whose light still shone \nas the sun was ascending to heaven. Thus the betrayer was the spirit \nclosest to the deity; the hour that "loved" him. Hellenization of Israel \nconverted the dual morning-star and evening-star god into the Dioscuri \nor heavenly twins. Mithraic icons showed them turning the torch of \nlife downward on one side of the sun, upward on the other. 7 \n\nThere was another interpretation of the mysterious passage em- \nbedded in the famous legend of the Wandering Jew. Ignoring the \ntwo accounts of Judas\'s death, medieval interpreters said Jesus meant \nthat Judas, for his crime, was condemned never to die until Jesus \n"came again" at the end of the world. So Judas wandered through time, \nweary but deathless, living many lifetimes in bitterness and regret. \nPerhaps this tale of Wandering Jew was intended to mock the pagans\' \nidea of many reincarnations on earth. \n\nYet another Christianization of Judas transformed him into St. \nJude, adopted into the Christian canon because the ancient cult of \nJudas continued in Judea and couldn\'t be eradicated. The fictitious St. \nJude became very popular in the Middle Ages. True to his Judaic \ncharacter, the saint was called "a powerful intercessor for those in \ndesperate straits." 8 \n\n1.

He was called \nJulian the Hospitaller. 1 \n\nJulian\'s Christian legend was hardly very saintly. Returning home \nfrom a late journey, he found two people in his bed and killed them \nboth, assuming he had caught his wife with her lover. Instead, the \nmurdered pair proved to be Julian\'s own father and mother. 2 As \npenance for his error, Julian took his wife and went to live by a ford, \nwhere they gave shelter and assistance to travelers. The legend seems \nto have been concocted from nothing more substantial than a votive \nfigure of the emperor Julian at a roadside shrine, where travelers left \nofferings so as to have good fortune on the road. Many of the gods thus \nhonored by pagan pilgrims were arbitrarily declared saints in order to \nprovide a Christian motive for the worship given them. \n\nl.Attwater,206. 2. Hazlitt, 351. \n\n\n\nS^ Juno \n\n^^X Roman Great Mother, derived from Sabine-Etruscan Uni, the \n\nThree-in-One deity cognate with "yoni" and "Uni-verse." Juno had \ndozens of attributes or emanations which are sometimes erroneously \n\nviewed as separate Goddesses. Juno Fortuna was the Goddess of Fate. \n\nSign of Juno Juno Sospita was the Preserver. Juno Regina was Queen of Heaven. \n\nJuno Lucina was Goddess of Celestial Light. Juno Moneta was the \nAdvisor and Admonisher. Juno Martialis was the virgin mother of \nMars. Juno Caprotina, or Februa, was the Goddess of erotic love. Juno \nPopulonia was Mother of the People. And so on, through many \nother Junos. 1 \n\nEvery Roman woman embodied a bit of Goddess\'s spirit, her own \nsoul a juno, corresponding to the genius of a man. 2 Later patriarchal \nvocabularies dropped the word juno but retained genius, thus depriving \nwomen of their souls which may be why church councils of the \nearly Middle Ages sometimes maintained that women are soulless. \n\nJuno\'s sacred month of June honored her as patroness of marriages \nand the family, which is why June is still the traditional time for \nweddings. \n\n\n\n484 \n\n\n\nJuno had her formidable aspects too. As a battle-goddess she Jupiter \n\nrepresented the fighting spirit of a mother defending her offspring, Justice \n\nthe epitome of bravery by Roman definition. Therefore Juno Seispitei ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nMatri Reginae (Juno the Preserver, Queen of the Mothers) was \nregarded as the spirit of war. 3 Her title was the same as that of the Hindu \nwar-goddess Durga the Preserver, Leader of the Mothers. 4 Like all \nIndo-European forms of the Goddess, Juno was only another local \nmanifestation of the same all-encompassing deity. \n\nAmong Juno\'s sacred symbols were the peacock, the cowrie shell, \nand of course the lily, or lotus, universal yonic emblem. With her \nsacred lily, Juno conceived the god Mars without any assistance from \nher consort, Jupiter; thus she became the Blessed Virgin Juno. 5 The \nthree-lobed lily that used to represent her parthenogenetic power was \ninherited by the virgin Mary, who still retains it. \n\n\n\nJustice \n\nThe spirit of justice was female in classic paganism. Ulpian said \njustice depended on "the feminine nature principle, which has a \nprofounder kinship with the natura iustum (that which is just by \nnature) than does the male sex, with its greater susceptibility to the \nprinciple of domination." Pythagoreans taught that iusticia and aequi- \ntas (justice and equity) are "innate attributes of the feminine nature \nprinciple." \' \n\nThe Roman praetor or judge "gave expression to justice as the \norgan and viva vox of Bona Dea-Fauna-Fatua. Through this tie with \nthe material primordial mother he was enabled to observe the practical \n\n\n\n\\ \n\n\n\n1. Lamusse, 203-4; Rose, 217. 2. Reinach, 102; Rose, 193. 3. Dumezil, 297. \n4.

Zeus Pater, the Greek Heavenly \n\nFather, was another incarnation of the same Aryan deity, whose \n\nworship spread westward with migrations and invasions of Indo-Euro- Sign of Jupiter \n\npean patriarchal tribes. Like his counterparts in other nations, Jupiter \n\nwas primarily a rain god: hisjnn ctinn was to fertilize the soil wi th \n\nseminal moisture. Thus he was connected also with thunder and \n\nlightning his voice and his weapon. He was commonly known as \n\nJupiter Pluvius, "the Heavenly- Father- Who- Rains." \n\nJupiter was added to the originally female Capitoline Triad by \nousting the Virgin form of the Goddess, Juventas, leaving Juno and \nMinerva as Jupiter\'s two female partners. 1 Juno was said to be his wife, \nthough like Hera she was much older than her spouse. \n\n1.

Bachofen, 193. \n\n\n\nKa \n\nOne of an Egyptian\'s seven souls, often believed to be a spirit-twin \nresident in the afterbirth. 1 The Shilluks of the upper Nile, who in the \npresent century still worshipped the Cow-mother Hathor as bestower \nof the souls, buried afterbirths of their sacred kings in the same tombs \nwhere the kings themselves would be laid on the theory that a man \nneeded his ka in order to become a god after death. 2 In ancient Egypt, \nprayers were addressed to the ka of Osiris and other gods. India knew \nthe same concept, even the same word. Brahma had a soul-twin named \nKa, which was translated "Who?" 5 \n\nThe hieroglyphic sign of the ka was a pair of upraised arms with \nbent elbows. 4 This arm position evidently invoked the Goddess, and \nwas connected with the idea of the ka as a mother-given entity, each \nbaby\'s unformed twin, made of blood. 5 A Paleolithic painting from \nAlgeria shows a hunter stalking an ostrich while a full-hipped female \nfigure, larger than he, raises her arms in the position of the ka. The \nfemale figure was either a mother or a sexual partner, as shown by a \nserpentine connective line running from the hunter\'s crotch to hers. 6 \nEvidently, she made magic to help the hunter in his efforts, even \nthough she may have been far away. \n\nA vase figure from Amratian times showed a similar /ra-invocation \nperformed by a priestess, assisted by two men who helped hold her \narms aloft when she became tired. 7 The same magical /ra-invocation was \nperformed by Moses at the battle between Israelites and Amalekites. \nThe Israelites won because Moses, with the help of Aaron and Hur, \nheld up his arms in the Jte-position all day until the battle ended at \nsunset (Exodus 17:12). \n\nEgyptians thought the Jta-soul was immortal and dwelt in or near j \nthe tomb where the body rested. The same notion was common \namong Christians, who said a ghost lived in or near the grave. There is j \nin existence a letter written by an ancient Egyptian to his deceased \nwife, three years after her death. He attached the letter to the portrait \nstatue in her tomb, confident that her ka would read the letter. 8 \n\nAmong northern Aryans the idea of the ka was transposed into the \nDoppelganger (double-goer), a hidden twin-soul thought to reside in \n\n\n\n486 \n\n\n\nthe placenta or umbilical cord, though sometimes it could develop into a Kaaba \n\nfull-grown twin. Germanic folklore has many examples of the soul Kala-Nath \n\npreserved in a safer location than the body e.g., the giant who kept his ... \n\nsoul in an egg, and so on. German and French peasants used to treat \n\nan umbilical cord or afterbirth with great care, to give magical assistance \n\nto the child\'s future health or longevity. Sometimes, as in Greek \n\nmyth, mothers preserved their children\'s umbilical cords in a secret \n\nplace, thinking no harm could come to the child as long as the cord \n\nwas intact. 9 \n\n1. H.

Men had to study Kalanemi in order to learn \nkalends, the proper order of seasons, sabbaths, and festivals. Kalanemi \nwas probably an aspect of Kali Ma as the Crone of Time; it is interesting \nthat the second part of the name, nemi, meant the Moon-grove in \nGreco-Roman culture, and according to ancient astrologers the zodiac \nwas the moon\'s grove through which she passed in the night (see \nGrove, Sacred).

Shah, 29, 175. \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n"Dark Mother," the Hindu Triple Goddess of creation, preservation, \nand destruction; now most commonly known in her Destroyer aspect, \nsquatting over her dead consort Shiva and devouring his entrails, \nwhile her yoni sexually devours his lingam (penis). Kali is "The hungry \nearth, which devours its own children and fattens on their corpses. . . . \nIt is in India that the experience of the Terrible Mother has been given \nits most grandiose form as Kali. But all this and it should not be \nforgotten is an image not only of the Feminine but particularly and \nspecifically of the Maternal. For in a profound way life and birth are \nalways bound up with death and destruction." \' \n\nKali was the basic archetypal image of the birth-and-death Mother, \nsimultaneously womb and tomb, giver of life and devourer of her \nchildren: the same image portrayed in a thousand ancient religions. \nEven modern psychologists face this image with uneasy acknowledg- \nment of its power. It seems the image of the angry, punishing, castrating \nFather is somehow less threatening than that of the destructive \nMother perhaps because she symbolized the inexorable reality of \ndeath, whereas he only postulated a problematic post-mortem \njudgment. 2 \n\n\n\n488 \n\n\n\nTantric worshippers of Kali thought it essential to face her Curse, \nthe terror of death, as willingly as they accepted Blessings from her \nbeautiful, nurturing, maternal aspect. For them, wisdom meant learning \nthat no coin has only one side: as death can\'t exist without life, so also \nlife can\'t exist without death. Kali\'s sages communed with her in the \ngrisly atmosphere of the cremation ground, to become familiar with \nimages of death. They said: "His Goddess, his loving Mother in time, \nwho gives him birth and loves him in the flesh, also destroys him in \nthe flesh. His image of Her is incomplete if he does not know Her as his \ntearer and devourer." 3 \n\nFew western scholars understood the profound philosophy behind \nthe hideous images of Kali the Destroyer. The London Museum \ndisplayed such an image with a label saying only, "Kali Destroying \nDemon." 4 The Encyclopaedia Britannica devoted five columns to \nChristian interpretations of the Logos without ever mentioning its \norigin in Kali\'s Om or Creative Word; Kali herself was dismissed in a \nbrief paragraph as the wife of Shiva and "a goddess of disease." 5 \nCertainly, as the Kalika or Crone she governed every form of death \nincluding disease; but she also ruled every form of life. \n\nKali stood for Existence, which meant Becoming because all her \nworld was an eternal living flux from which all things rose and \ndisappeared again, in endless cycles. The gods, whom she bore and \ndevoured, addressed her thus: \n\nThou art the Original of all the manifestations; Thou art the birthplace of \neven Us; Thou knowest the whole world, yet none know Thee. . . . \nThou art both Subtle and Gross, Manifested and Veiled, Formless, yet \nwith form. Who can understand Thee?. . . . It is Thou who art the \nSupreme Primordial Kalika. . . . Resuming after dissolution Thine own \nform, dark and formless, Thou alone remainest as One ineffable and \ninconceivable . . . though Thy self without beginning, multiform by the \npower of Maya, Thou art the Beginning of all, Creatrix, Protectress, \nand Destructress. 6 \n\nBrahmans assigned Kali\'s three functions to three male gods, \nlling them Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Kali\'s \narchaic consort Shiva the destroyer; but many scriptures opposed this \nmale trinity as offensively artificial. A prayer in the Tantrasara said: "O \nvlother! Cause and Mother of the World! Thou art the One \n\'rimordial Being, Mother of innumerable creatures, Creatrix of the \n\nry gods; even of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and \nShiva the Destroyer! O Mother, in hymning Thy praise I purify my \nh!" 7 The Nirvana Tantra treated the claims of male gods with \ncontempt: \n\nBrahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara [Shiva], and other gods are born of the body \nof that beginningless and eternal Kalika, and at the time of dissolution \nthey again disappear in Her. O Devi, for this reason, so long as the living \nman does not know the supreme truth in regard to Her . . . his desire \nfor liberation can only give rise to ridicule. From a part only of Kalika, the \nprimordial Shakti, arises Brahma, from a part only arises Vishnu, and \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n\n\nTantrasara, Nirvana \nTantra, etc.. Tantras are \nbasic scriptures of \nTantrism, many of \nwhich have yet to be \ntranslated from Sanskrit \nor other original \nlanguages into English. \nExtant texts date \nback to ca. 600 a.d., \nthough the material \nwas much older. \nAmong the most \npopular Hindu Tantras \nare the \n\nShaktisamgama, \nKularnava, \n\nMahanirvanatantra, and \nTantraraja. \n\n\n\n489 \n\n\n\nKali Ma from a part only arises Shiva. O fair-eyed Devi, just as rivers and lakes are \n\nunable to traverse a vast sea, so Brahma and other gods lose their \nseparate existence on entering the uncrossable and infinite being of Great \n\n^^^"^^^^^ Kali. Compared with the vast sea of the being of Kali, the existence of \n\nBrahma and the other gods is nothing but such a little water as is \ncontained in the hollow made by a cow\'s hoof. Just as it is impossible \nfor a hollow made by a cow\'s hoof to form a notion of the unfathomable \ndepths of a sea, so it is impossible for Brahma and other gods to have a \nknowledge of the nature of Kali. 8 \n\nEven the arrogant Vishnu, who claimed to have brought the \nwhole earth out of the primal abyss, received the grace of enlightenment \nconcerning Kali and wrote a poem about her: "Material cause of all \nchange, manifestation and destruction ... the whole Universe \nrests upon Her, rises out of Her and melts away into Her. From Her are \ncrystallized the original elements and qualities which construct \n\nthe apparent worlds. She is both mother and grave The gods \n\nthemselves are merely constructs out of Her maternal substance, \nwhich is both consciousness and potential joy." 9 \n\nThe Yogini Tantra said of Kali, "Whatever power anything \npossesses, that is the Goddess." 10 Shakti, "Power," was one of her \nimportant names. Without her, neither man nor god could act at all: \n\nIt is She as Power (Shakti) who takes the active and changeful part in \ngeneration, as also in conceiving, bearing, and giving birth to the \nWorld-Child. All this is the function of the divine, as it is of the human, \nmother. . . . It is thus to the Mother that man owes the World of Forms \nor Universe. Without Her as material cause, Being cannot display itself. It \nis but a corpse . . . primacy is given to the Mother, and it is said, "What \ncare I for the Father if I but be on the lap of the Mother?" \' \' \n\nA Tantric scholar points out that "the poets have found much \nmore intimate cries of the heart when they spoke of the Deity as their \n\'Mother\' than when they addressed themselves to God as Father." \nKali\'s poets approached her through love: "By feeling is She known. \nHow then can lack of feeling find Her?" In their view, "All is the \nMother and She is reality herself. \'Sa\'ham\' (She I Am) the Sakta says, \nand all that he senses is She in the form in which he perceives her. It \nis She who in, and as, him drinks the consecrated wine, and She is the \nwine." She feeds him as a mother feeds her child, and he becomes \nimmortal: "Deathless are those who have fed at the breast of the \nMother of the Universe." The Yoginihrdaya Tantra says, "Obei- \nsance to Her who is pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss, as Power, who \nexists in the form of Time and Space and all that is therein, and who \nis the radiant Illuminatrix in all beings." n \n\nAs a Mother, Kali was called Treasure-House of Compassion \n(karuna), Giver of Life to the world, the Life of all lives. Contrary to \nthe west\'s idea of her as a purely destructive Goddess, she was the fount \nof every kind of love, which flowed into the world only through her \nagents on earth, women. Thus it was said a male worshipper of Kali \n\n\n\n490 \n\n\n\n"bows down at the feet of women," regarding them as his rightful \nteachers. 13 \n\nThe name of Eve may have originated with Kali\'s leva or Jiva, the \nprimordial female principle of manifestation; she gave birth to her \n"first manifested form" and called him Idam (Adam). She also bore the \nsame title given to Eve in the Old Testament: Mother of All Living \n(Jaganmata). 17 \n\nAs the primal Deep, or menstrual Ocean of Blood at creation, Kali \nwas certainly the same as the biblical tehom, Tiamat, or tohu bohu, \nthe "flux" representing her state of formlessness between manifested \nuniverses. As Mahanila-Sarasvati the great blue River-Goddess, she \nwas probably the original namesake of the River Nile. As Kundalini the \nFemale Serpent, she resembled the archaic Egyptian serpent-mother \nsaid to have created the world. It was said of Kundalini that at the \nbeginning of the universe, she starts to uncoil in "a spiral line \nmovement which is the movement of creation." 18 This spiral line was \nvitally important in late Paleolithic and Neolithic religious symbolism, \nrepresenting death and rebirth as movement into the disappearing-point \nof formlessness, and out of it again, to a new world of form. Spirals \ntherefore appeared on tombs, as one of the world\'s first mystical \nsymbols. \n\nLunar priests of Sinai, formerly priestesses of the Moon-goddess, \ncalled themselves kafa. 22 Similar priestesses of prehistoric Ireland \nwere kelles, origin of the name Kelly, which meant a hierophantic clan \ndevoted to "the Goddess Kele" (see Kelle). 23 This was cognate with \nthe Saxon Kale, or Cale, whose lunar calendar or kalends included the \nspring month of Sproutkale, when Mother Earth (Kale) put forth \nnew shoots. 24 In antiquity the Phoenicians referred to the strait of \nGibraltar as Calpe, because it was considered the passage to the \nwestern paradise of the Mother. 25 \n\nIndo-European languages branched from the root of Sanskrit, said \nto be Kali\'s invention. She created the magic letters of the Sanskrit \nalphabet and inscribed them on the rosary of skulls around her neck. 27 \nThe letters were magic because they stood for primordial creative \nenergy expressed in sound Kali\'s mantras brought into being the very \nthings whose names she spoke for the first time, in her holy language. \nIn short, Kali\'s worshippers originated the doctrine of the Logos or \ncreative Word, which Christians later adopted and pretended it was \ntheir own idea. Kali\'s letters magically combined the elements, which \nwere previously separate as fiery-airy (male) or watery-earthy (fe- \nmale) forces. The former were "cruel"; the latter "benevolent." 28 This \ndistinction seemed to reflect the Tantric view of Kali as Lady of Life \nand her spouse as Lord of Death. \n\nThough called "the One," Kali was always a trinity: the same \nVirgin-Mother-Crone triad established perhaps nine or ten millenia \nago, giving the Celts their triple Morrigan; the Greeks their triple \nMoerae and all other manifestations of the Threefold Goddess; the \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n\n\nWestern scholars \nerroneously viewed the \nvarious \n\nmanifestations and \nincarnations of Kali \nas many different \nGoddesses, \nparticularly isolating \nthose primitive \nmatrikadevis (mother- \ngoddesses) grouped \ntogether as "Dravidian \nshe-ogres." H Yet \nKali\'s worshippers \nplainly \n\nstated that she had \nhundreds of different \nnames, but they were all \nthe same Goddess: \nSarasvati, Lakshmi, \nGayatri, Durga, \nAnnapurna, Sati, Uma, \nParvati, Gauri, \nBagala, Matangini, \nDhumavati, Tara, \nBhairavi, Kundalini, \nBharga, Devata, etc. \nAll were Kali Mahadevi, \nthe "Great \nGoddess" the same \ntitle she bore among \nwestern pagans. \' 5 \n\nSome of Kali\'s \nolder names found \ntheir way into the Bible. \nAs Tara, the earth, \nshe became Terah, \nmother of the \nHebrew ancestral spirits \ncalled teraphim. \nThe same Kali-Tara \nbecame the Celts\' \nTara, Gauls\' Taranis, \nEtruscans\' Turan, \nand the Latin Terra, \n"Mother Earth," \nsaid to be \n\ninterchangeable with \nVenus. 16 \n\n\n\n491 \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n\n\nVariations of Kali\'s \nbasic name occurred \nthroughout the \nancient world. The \nGreeks had a word \nKalli, meaning \n"beautiful," but \napplied to things that \nwere not particularly \nbeautiful such as the \ndemonic centaurs \ncalled kallikantzari, \nrelatives of Kali\'s \nAsvins. Their city of \nKallipolis, the \nmodern Gallipoli, was \ncentered in Amazon \ncountry formerly ruled \nby Artemis Kalliste. 19 \nThe annual birth \nfestival at Eleusis was \nKalligeneia, translatable \nas "coming forth \nfrom the Beautiful \nOne," or "coming \nforth from Kali." 20 The \ntemple of the Great \nMother of the Gods at \nPergamum stood on \nMount Mamurt-Kaleh, \neasily transposed into \nMount Mother- Kali. 21 \n\n\n\nKali\'s title Devi \n(Goddess) was similarly \nwidespread in Indo- \nEuropean languages. \nShe was the Latin \ndiva (Goddess) and Mi- \nnoan diwi or Diwija, \nthe "Goddess" associ- \nated with Zeus at \nKnossos. 26 Dia, Dea, \nand Diana were al- \nternate forms of the \nsame title. \n\n\n\nNorsemen their triple Norns; the Romans their triple Fates and triadic \nUni Quno); the Egyptians their triple Mut; the Arabs their triple \nMoon-goddess she was the same everywhere. Even Christians mod- \neled their threefold God on her archetypal trinity. 29 \n\nHer three forms were manifested in many ways: in the three \ndivisions of the year, the three phases of the moon, the three sections \nof the cosmos (heaven, earth, and the underworld), the three stages of \nlife, the three trimesters of pregnancy, and so on. Women repre- \nsented her spirit in mortal flesh. "The Divine Mother first appears in \nand as Her worshipper\'s earthly mother, then as his wife; thirdly as \nKalika, She reveals Herself in old age, disease and death." 50 \n\nThree kinds of priestesses tended her shrines: Yoginis or Shaktis, \nthe "Maidens"; Matri, the "Mothers"; and Dakinis, the \n"Skywalkers" who attended the dying, governed funerary rites and \nacted as angels of death. All had their counterparts in the spirit world. \nTo this day, Tantric Buddhism relates the three mortal forms of woman \nto the divine female trinity called Three Most Precious Ones. 31 \n\nKali\'s three forms appeared in the sacred colors known as Gunas: \nwhite for the Virgin, red for the Mother, black for the Crone, \nsymbolizing birth, life, death. 52 Black was Kali\'s fundamental color as \nthe Destroyer, for it meant the formless condition she assumed \nbetween creations, when all the elements were dissolved in her primor- \ndial substance. "As white, yellow, and other colors all disappear in \nblack, in the same way ... all beings enter Kali." 53 \n\nThe Black Goddess was known in Finland as Kalma (Kali Ma), a \nhaunter of tombs and an eater of the dead. 54 European "witches" \nworshipped her in the same funereal places, for the same reasons, that \nTantric yogis and dakinis worshipped her in cremation grounds, as \nSmashana-Kali, Lady of the Dead. 55 Their ceremonies were held in the \nplaces of ghosts where ordinary folk feared to go. 56 So were the \nceremonies of western "witches" that is, pagans. They adored the \nBlack Mother Earth in cemeteries, where Roman tombstones in- \nvoked her with the phrase Mater genuit, Mater recepit the Mother \nbore me, the Mother took me back. 57 \n\nSometimes Kali the Destroyer wore red, suggesting the blood of \nlife that she gave and took back: "As She devours all existence, as She \nchews all things existing with Her fierce teeth, therefore a mass of blood \nis imagined to be the apparel of the Queen of the Gods at the final \ndissolution." 58 The gypsies, who worshipped Kalika as a disease-causing \nGoddess they called "the Aunt," clothed her in red, the proper color \nfor gypsy funerals. 59 \n\nBlood was as much a part of Kali\'s worship as it was of the \nworship of the biblical God who said blood must be poured on his altars \nto bring remission of sins (Hebrews 9:22). The difference between \nthe western God\'s demand for blood and Kali\'s was that Jewish priests \ntook away the meat and ate it themselves (Numbers 18:9), whereas \ndevotees of Kali were permitted to eat their own offerings, as in \nCalcutta: \n\n\n\n492 \n\n\n\nThe temple serves simply as a slaughterhouse, for those performing the \nsacrifice retain their animals, leaving only the head in the temple as a \nsymbolic gift, while the blood flows to the Goddess. For to the Goddess is \ndue the lifeblood of all creatures since it is she who has bestowed it \nand that is why the beast must be slaughtered in her temple; that is why \ntemple and slaughterhouse are one. \n\nThis rite is performed amid gruesome filth; in the mud compounded \nof blood and earth, the heads of the animals are heaped up like trophies \nbefore the statue of the Goddess, while those sacrificing return home for a \nfamily banquet of the bodies of their animals. The Goddess desires only \nthe blood of the offerings, hence beheading is the form of sacrifice, since \nthe blood drains quickly from the beheaded beasts . . . ; the head \nsignifies the whole, the total sacrifice. * \n\nBeheading or throat-cutting were common methods of sacrifi- \ncial killing in the western world, too. "Kosher" killing for Yahweh \nconsisted, and still consists, of draining the animal\'s blood, because \nblood was the special food of deities. Kali demanded sacrifice of male \nanimals only, for they were expendable a custom harking back to \nthe primitive belief that males had no part in the cycles of generation. \nShiva himself, as Kali\'s sacrificial spouse, commanded that female \nanimals must never be slain at the altar. 41 \n\nKali was the Ocean of Blood at the beginning and end of the \nworld, and her ultimate destruction of the universe was prefigured by \ndestruction of each individual, though her karmic wheel always brought \nreincarnation. After death came nothing-at-all, which Tantric sages \ncalled the third of the three states of being; to experience it was like the \nexperience of Dreamless Sleep. This state was also called "the \nGenerative Womb of All, the Beginning and End of Beings." 42 Kali \ndevoured Time itself. At the end of Time, she resumed her "dark \nformlessness," which appeared in all the myths of before-creation and \nafter-doomsday as elemental Chaos. 43 \n\nThe mystical experience of Kali was often described as a preview \nof formlessness beyond the veil of death: a psychic return to the \nwomb, to be united with Kali\'s oceanic being. Thus Ramakrishna \ndescribed it: \n\n/ was suffering from excruciating pain because I had not been blessed with \na vision of the Mother. . . . I feared that it might not be my lot to realize \nher in this life. I could not bear the separation any longer; life did not seem \nto be worth living. Then my eyes fell on the sword that was kept in the \nMother\'s temple. Determined to put an end to my life, I jumped up and \nseized it, when suddenly the blessed Mother revealed herself to me. \n. . . the temple and all vanished, leaving no trace; instead there was a \nlimitless, infinite, shining ocean of consciousness or spirit. As far as the \neye could see, its billows were rushing towards me from all sides . . . to \nswallow me up. I was panting for breath. I was caught in the billows \nand fell down senseless. H \n\nRamakrishna revitalized the worship of the Mother, as his pupil \n/ivekananda said; "It was no new truths that Ramakrishna came to \n>reach, though his advent brought old truths to light." 45 Vivekananda \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n\n\nRamakrishna (1836 \n1886) Leading Hindu \nsaint of the 19th \ncentury, familiar in the \nwestern world \nthrough the teachings of \nhis famous disciple \nVivekananda. \n\n\n\n493 \n\n\n\nKama-Mara predicted the resurgence of the Mother into the consciousness of the \n\nKamsa world\'s population, after patriarchal religions had forced her into \n\n^^ mmt ^ mim ^^^^ concealment in the unconscious: "One vision I see clear as life before \nme, that the ancient mother has awakened once more, sitting on her \nthrone rejuvenated, more glorious than ever. Proclaim her to all the \nworld with the voice of peace and benediction." 46 Clearly, this \nGoddess was much more than the London Museum\'s "Destroying \nDemon." \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 149-53. 2.

The Upanishads said Kama- \nMara was the Self, source of both desire and fear. 1 But Mara was \nonce the mother of the Maruts or nature-spirits; Kama was the Vedic \nequivalent of Eros; it seems likely that they were combined in an \narchaic period as a sexual androgyne. The "demonic" combination \nexpressed the ascetics\' belief that eroticism drew the flesh of men \ntoward destruction. \n\nA Buddhist legend said the Blessed One met the challenge of \nKama-Mara by touching the earth with his fingers, thus invoking the \nirresistible power of the universal Mother, who protected him. 2 \n\n1.

I will smash your body with my own \nhands and drink your warm blood."

The usual symbol was a wheel, representing endless cycles of \nbecoming, every force or entity in the universe begetting equal and \nopposite reactions to its own action, all forces maintaining balance. The \nGoddess\'s law was that any individual evolution must be worked out \nby a series of reincarnations through the turnings of the great wheel of \ntime. Evil actions resulted in rebirth to a more evil life; good actions \nbrought lives of increasing virtue and happiness. Ascetic yogis of early \nBuddhism instituted the idea that one could take short cuts through \nthe cycles of time and escape altogether from the inexorable karmic \nwheel into a state of Nirvana or cosmic not-being, the individual \ndissolved in the infinite. \n\n\n\niruna \n\nrantric term for the basic quality of mother-love, directly experi- \nlced in infancy and ramified in adulthood to embrace all forms of love: \naching, tenderness, compassion, sensual enjoyment, and eroticism. \n\n\n\n495 \n\n\n\nKanjna Many centuries before Freudian psychology recognized "infantile sexu- \n\nality," Tantric sages called karuna the essence of religion: a gut \n_____ ______ feeling of loving-kindness, as opposed to the often cruel or useless \n\nverbalizing of theological principles. 1 It was understood that karuna \nmust be learned through physical and sexual contact comfort, by adults \nand children alike. Thus the identity of infantile, sexual, warmly \nloving, and religious behavior patterns was perceived long ago and is just \nnow being rediscovered by western civilization. \n\nThe ancients well knew the experience of being in love recapitu- \nlates the mother-child relationship in its intimate physical attachment, \ntrust, and dependence. Recognition of one particular other as a love \nobject surely evolved from the instinctive mechanism that binds \ntogether individual mothers and offspring. It has been shown even in \nthe animal realm that adequate sexual functioning in adulthood \ndepends on satisfactory relations with the mother in infancy. 2 \n\nIn ancient times the Goddess\'s sacred whores were special teachers \nof karuna, which may have been the root of modern Italian carogna, \n"whore." Pagan Rome gave the Great Goddess the title of Mater Cara, \n"Mother Beloved." 3 She combined all the qualities of sexuality, \nmotherhood, marital bliss, friendship, generosity and mercy, or caritas, \nwhich the Christian church later purged of its sensual implications \nand transformed into "charity," the giving of money to earn points in \nthe after-life. The Greek version of karuna was embodied in the \nCharites or Graces, the naked Triple Goddess, whose quality of "grace" \nwas also altered in the Christian context. In Babylon, the Great \nMother under the name of Ishtar was also the Great Whore and the \nlover of all men, expressing karuna in her self-description, "A \nprostitute compassionate am I." 4 \n\nThe Christian derivative of Mari-Ishtar was Mary Magdalene, \nthe sacred harlot who said harlots are "compassionate of all the \nrace of mankind." 5 Gnostic Gospels mentioned Mary Magdalene as the \noriginal female pope, embodying the true Christian spirit kept secret \nfrom male apostles, while it passed directly from Jesus through \nhis surpassing love for Mary. 6 Significantly, Christian iconographers \noften confused Mary the harlot and Mary the mother. See \nProstitution. \n\nMotherhood, sensual satisfactions, and kindly feelings were associ- \nated with the spirit of the Goddess under all her names, and especially \nwith women as her earthly representatives. The integrated idea of \nkaruna with all its ramifications has virtually disappeared from mod- \nern western society, where it is even difficult to explain its older \nmeanings. Yet "those modes of perceiving the world and organizing \nbehavior which are more distinctly \'female\' can\'t be thought of as \nhaving sprung into being in the context of the world we now inhabit. \n. . . We must think in terms of patterns of behaving that developed over \nuntold centuries, and which were keyed to survival of the human \ngroup in the primitive environment. Such a way of being would have \n\n\n\n496 \n\n\n\nbeen predicated upon powerful social bonds, \'bonds of love,\' which Kauri \n\nwould serve to keep otherwise more vulnerable individuals in close \n\nproximity to protectors." Every individual was to some extent in need ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nof protectors: "It may be that we feel loneliness to be so potentially \n\nannihilating because, to the lone human and above all, the lone \n\nhuman infant or child being alone was death." 7 \n\nWestern culture began to lose sight of the close relationship \nbetween sensuality and loving-kindness when its theology followed \nSt. Augustine to his conclusion that every child is born tainted with sin \nbecause of its necessarily sexual conception. 8 Nearly all manifesta- \ntions of love fell under theological suspicion because nearly all involved \nthe feminine principle in some way. (See Romance.) "Men\'s sexual \ndrive was unacceptable to them and so it was projected onto women. It \nwas women whose lust was said to be insatiable. . . . [V]iewing wom- \nan as seductress and temptress is still evident, as can be seen by the fact \nthat prostitutes, but seldom their customers, are arraigned, and the \nfact that the rape victim is often seen as having \'asked for\' her attack by \ndressing or behaving seductively." 9 \n\nIn a society that lacks any coherent articulation of the concept of \nkaruna, women as mothers, lovers, and caretakers "learn early that \nthey should be ashamed of the very set of qualities which are particularly \ntheirs. Ironically, at the same time, they are constantly threatened by \nthe prospect that if they are not affectionate enough and as close and \nloving to others as they ought to be, they will have failed in their own \nand others\' eyes." The result is "a noxious social climate which fosters \ntoo little feeling in men and too much in women." 10 \n\nLoss of this all-important concept may create social evils of the \nmost pervasive sort. "Male public culture gets caught up with \nmachines and puts emphasis on things that are not alive. The decision- \nmaking of males in power tends to happen in a vacuum with little \nreference to the needs of life. Paradoxically, the public leaders who are \nsupposed to help us deny death become increasingly oblivious to life \nand show increasing contempt for it. We have a civilization in which \nmales in high places imitate a male god in heaven both think \nthemselves above the petty concerns of simple nurture and delight in \ngenerative life." 11 \n\n1.

Kauri was \nsometimes translated "Brilliant One," a name for the Goddess\'s virgin \naspect: she who gave their "Power" (Shakti) to the gods. 1 Kauri was \nalso a name for the vulva (yoni), descriptive of the cowrie shell accepted \n\n\n\n497 \n\n\n\nKelle all over the world as a symbol of the female genital and its curative \n\nKeres and generative properties. \n\n^^^t^m^^^m^^^^^m 1. Larousse, 375. \n\n\n\nvar. Kelly Kelle \n\nIrish-druidic priest-name, derived from pre-Christian holy harlots of \nthe Goddess Kelle, Kale, or Kali. Irish writings described the divine \nharlot Mary Magdalene as a kelle. 1 The medieval term Kele-De was \nconsidered somewhat mysterious, translated "Bride of God" if a wom- \nan, "Servant of God" if a man. 2 These translations were inaccurate. \nKele-De meant literally the spirit of the Goddess Kele, evidently \nidentical with the Goddess Kali of the original Indo-European Celts. \n\nVotaries of the Goddess Kele stressed the search for inward \nperfection through meditation, yogic style. 5 Her gods assumed the \nlotus position like eastern yogis. Her primitive Grail hero, Peredur, \nexperienced her as the "most beautiful woman in the world," \nrepresented by the three colors of the Divine Prakriti, still known as the \nGunas, standing for her powers of creation, preservation, and \ndestruction. 4 \n\nThe mythical "St. Kilda" seems to have been another version of \nthe Goddess Kele, dwelling on a remote rocky islet once identified \nwith the western paradise of the dead. St. Kilda\'s Isle still exists, but the \norigin of its name has been forgotten. The ubiquitous Irish word kill, \na cell or cave, once meant a shrine of Kele, whose holy men called \nthemselves Culdees, Colidees, Cele-De, Keledio, etc. Some were \ndescribed in Christian histories as monks, though they were obviously \nmarried. 5 \n\nKildare was a major shrine of the Goddess Kilda- Kele, or Brigit, \nidentified with the virgin Mary after Christian monks appropriated \nthe site. But the guardianship of the sacred fire at Kildare had long been \na prerogative of priestesses; the shrine was forbidden to men. 6 \nConfusion of Kilda-Kele-Brigit with Mary was not too far-fetched, as \nthey had been aspects of the same Goddess for thousands of years in \nIndia as Kali-Mari or Kel-Mari, the Pot Goddess who made human \nforms out of clay. 7 (See Kali Ma.) \n\n1.

Wealthy Egyptians paid large \nurns to have themselves buried near his tomb, to insure their \n*rsonal resurrection. 1 In the same way, Christians later insisted on \n\n\n\n499 \n\n\n\nKhepera being buried near the "body" of their savior in the church hence \n\nKhnum th e funerary churchyard. \n\ni^i_ 1 .

Khepera was adopted by the solar \npriesthood because of a belief that all dung-beetles were male, \nreproducing through eggs incubated in their dung balls without the he! \nof females. 1 The scarab\'s dung ball was identified with the sun, which \nKhepera rolled daily across the sky. \n\nSome priests said Khepera achieved male motherhood by mastur- \nbation. "I had union with my hand, and ... I poured seed into my \nown mouth, and I sent forth from myself issue in the form of . . . Shu \nand Tefnut." Khepera insisted he was the sole creator; "there was no \nother being who worked with me." Yet like all gods he was forced to \ndepend on a mother-symbol. He said, "I laid a foundation in Maa," \nthe Goddess as primal matter. 2 \n\nFinally the mother-symbol re-absorbed him. Some said Khepera \nhad no reproductive power until he received an eye of the female \nmoon, which could give birth to plants and animals. He became just \nanother child of the Goddess: "Tem-Khepera who produced himself \non the thighs of his divine mother." 3 He was shown emerging from a \nyonic lotus between the Goddess\'s two aspects, Isis and Nephthys. 4 \n\n1.

Baring-Gould, C.M.M.A., 375. \n\n\n\nKingship \n\niln early Asiatic civilizations, kingship depended on the choices of \nwomen. There was no law of primogeniture. Kings were rarely suc- \nceeded by their sons. Kings of Sumeria and Assyria were of unknown \nfatherhood. King Esakkuruna was called "the son of Nobody." \' \nWomen were the kingmakers in the lands he ruled. 2 \n\nMarriage with the earthly representative of the Goddess, in the \nform of the queen, was essential to the position of kingship; this was \nfthe original meaning of "holy matrimony" (hieros gamos). Akkadian \nkings apparently went on military expeditions chiefly to prove them- \nselves worthy of the sacred marriage. 3 \n\nAshurbanipal said he ruled by the grace of the Goddess Ishtar; he \nwas the king "whom her hands created." Shamash-shum-ukin of \nipabylon said he was chosen for kingship by the same Goddess under \ntier title of Erua, Queen of the Gods. King Esarhaddon of Assyria \nsaid he was "beloved of Queen Ishtar, the goddess of everything, the \nunsparing weapon, who brings destruction to the land of the \nenemy." 4 Ishme-Dagan, king of Isin in 1860 B.C., said he was "he \nwhom Inanna, queen of heaven and earth, has chosen for her \nt>eloved husband." 5 The Bronze Age king Ixion of Thessalian Lapiths \njmarried the Mother of the Gods after killing her former mate, \nflescribed as his father-in-law, because each king\'s successor was sup- \niposed to call his defeated rival "father." 6 The queens were the same \n|s Goddess, or Mother of God. The pharaoh Amenhotep III built a \ni temple for his wife Ti, who was worshipped as the Goddess. 7 \n\nThe goddess-queen\'s choice largely depended on the candidate\'s \n\n\n\n501 \n\n\n\nKingship sex appeal. If she tired of the king\'s lovemaking, he could be deposed \n\nor killed, for the queen\'s sexual acceptance of him determined the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ fertility of the land. In many early societies the old king was killed by \nthe new king, usually called a "son" though he was no blood relative. \nHence the unbroken chain of Oedipal murders that puzzled modern \nscholars before it was known that the words "father" and "son" were \nused in a different sense. A Babylonian tablet says: \n\nHaharni laid claim for himself to lordship over Dunnu. Earth raised her \nface to her son Amakandu. "Come let me make love to you " she said \nto him. Amakandu took his mother (for a wife) and Haharni his father he \nkilled; in Dunnu, which he loved, they laid him forest. And Amakandu \ntook over his father\'s lordship and Nether Sea, his sister, he took (as wife). \nLahar, son of Amakandu, came and Amakandu he killed, and in \nDunnu, in the (tomb) of his father he caused him to rest. Nether Sea, his \nmother, he took (as wife). 8 \n\nAfter this, Lahar\'s son killed Lahar and took his sister River as \nwife; he in turn was killed by his son, who married his sister Ningesh- \ntinna, "Lady of the Vine of Heaven," a shortened name of the \nGoddess Nin-gest-inanna. Sovereignty passed from mother to daughter, \nbeginning with Earth, the Goddess Dunnu herself, foundress of the \nline the same as Crete\'s Danuna, Anatolia\'s Danu, Greece\'s Danae, \nthe Gaulish Diana. Kings were expected to kill their predecessors or \npseudo-fathers. "Son" meant "successor," and "sister" was synonymous \nwith "wife." 9 \n\nThe length of a king\'s reign was often predetermined, because \npeople thought the Goddess needed the refreshment of a new lover \nat stated intervals. Up to 1810 a.d., kings of Zimbabwe were ceremoni- \nally strangled to death by their wives at the moon temple every four \nyears. 10 Kings of ancient Thebes reigned for seven years; so did kings of \nCanaan. Myths suggest a similar seven-year period for each king of \nCrete. Cretan kings were never allowed to grow old; they always died in \nthe full bloom of youth. 11 More recently, Nigerian kings were \nstrangled after the queen\'s pregnancy was established, which meant \neach king fulfilled his role in life by begetting one royal offspring. 12 \n\nWhite explorers in Africa spoke of tribal "kings," but rarely \nmentioned that the real rulers of the tribes were queens. "In the \noldest times there were no reigning princes in Africa, but the negroes \nhad large kingdoms [sic] which were ruled by goddesses." 1? Ghana \nwas governed by kings of a matrilineal succession whose divine right \npassed through sisters\' sons. The Lovedu were ruled by a female \n"king" who took a series of lovers but always left the government to one \nof the royal princesses. 14 Angola was ruled by women until the \nPortuguese invasions. Ashanti was ruled by queens until the British \nProtectorate in 1895. Its kings were subject to the queen mother; its \nprincesses took no husbands but kept a series of lovers. Similar customs \nobtained in Loango, Daura, the country of the Abrons, and other \n\n\n\n502 \n\n\n\n\\frican nations. The queen of Ubemba was called Mamfumer, Kingship \n\n\'Mother of Kings," and did all the governing. 15 \n\nThe Gospels\' "Candace queen of the Ethiopians" (Acts 8:27) was ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nlot a single individual but the hereditary title of queen mothers who \n{governed the Nubian states. 16 Ethiopian kings were ritually slain from \nhe earliest times. Regicide was still the custom of Nubian Kassites of \nhe Upper Nile in the 1st century b.c. Diodorus said only one Ethiopian \nTionarch escaped this kingly fate because he was educated in Greece \nnd dared to disobey tribal law. He led a party of soldiers into the \nsanctuary and killed all the priests before they could kill him. 17 \n\nThe Javanese Singasari dynasty had matriarchal queens similar to \nCandace, typified by Queen Dedes whose statues show her as a \npeautiful Shakti of wisdom. She married a number of new kings after \n[hey killed her previous consorts, each apparently holding office for a \nlieven-year period. 18 \n\nLegends consistently associate kingship with ceremonial death. A \nteal from Lagash shows the Goddess taking her new king by the \nland, while he raises a weapon to slay the old king, prostrate under the \nqueen\'s feet. 19 King Sennacherib of Assyria was "beaten to death \nvith statuettes of the gods" in the temple at Nineveh. Perpetrators of \n[he deed were his "sons," one of whom succeeded him as King \nEsarhaddon. Upon his accession, Esarhaddon proclaimed: "I am power- \nful, I am omnipotent, I am a hero, I am gigantic, I am colossal! " 20 \n\nSometimes, kings had to proclaim they were embodiments of the \nGoddess herself so as to rule with the same authority as queens. \nKntiochus of Commagene announced that he could rule because he \nUe5 the Goddess. 21 A king\'s investiture used to mean putting on \nfemale robes, so the king could be displayed as a transvestite Goddess \n[see Transvestism). \n\nIn the ancient Middle East generally, kings were not so much \ngoverning figures as ceremonial ones, primarily concerned with \nDedication of temples and other religious responsibilities. 22 Sometimes \n[hey were also war leaders, able to preserve their lives in time of \ndanger by convincing the people that no one else could defeat the \npnemy. In such a case, a surrogate victim might be found a real or \nadopted son, a prophet, a condemned criminal, or a divine animal. \n\nA war leader of Carthage "clothed his best and most beloved son \nn royal robes and crucified him as a sacrifice" to secure the blessing \npf Baal on his military campaigns. 23 Similarly, the god-king Isra-El \nclothed his only-begotten son Ieud in royal robes and sacrificed him \n[\'according to the custom of the Jews," as Philo said. 24 This king \nbecame Jesus, "king" of the Jews (John 18:33). Since a king was \nGod, any king\'s real or adopted son was naturally the Son of God; and \npahweh himself was embodied in the Jewish king. "In the early \nperiod of the Hebrew monarchy the central element of the annual New \npear festival was the ritual enthronement of Jahveh as King." 25 \n\nSon-killing was a habit, not only of the Jewish god-king but of \n\n\n\n503 \n\n\n\nKingship many other god-kings who modified the old custom by shedding the \n\nblood of someone else in the proper season. A Swedish king named \n^ H ^^^^^ H Aun managed to extend his reign for nine years by sacrificing one of \nhis nine sons each year to ransom his own life. 26 \n\nAnother Swedish king named Gunnar Helming simply ran away. \nAfter wrestling with the god Frey, incarnate in the previous king as \nbiblical Jacob wrestled with "a man who was God" and later received \nthe king-name of Isra-El Gunnar Helming took the king\'s place in \nthe bed of the high priestess (or Goddess). Evidently he pleased her, for \nwith her help he gathered up all the gold and silver treasures of kingly \noffice and escaped, taking her with him. 27 A similar story was told of \nTheseus\'s escape from the Minoan sacred king\'s fate with the help of \nthe priestess Ariadne, the incarnate Moon-goddess, who had taken a \nfancy to him. 28 \n\nSeleucus Nicator of Antioch, formerly one of Alexander\'s gener- \nals, became king of Syria but was forced to abdicate in favor of his \n"son" Antiochus, because the queen fell in love with the younger man \nand cast off her old spouse. 29 As late as 97 a.d., kings of Antioch were \n"chosen for merit" and deposed when their "merit" failed. This "merit\' \nseemed to have to do with their sexual capacity. 30 That is, it was virtu, \n"virility," from vir, "man." \n\nA common method of choosing a king was to test his virility by \nhaving him look on the Goddess\'s nakedness during the ritual bath that \nmagically restored her virginity each year. Actaeon, Teiresias, and \nlovers of the Germanic Earth Goddess were chosen by so viewing her. 51 \nGyges was chosen by the queen of Lydia, who bore the name of the \nGoddess Omphale, upon her display of her naked body to him; he was \ntold to kill the incumbent king and marry her. 32 Bath-Sheba, whose \nname meant she was the daughter of Arabian queens, married King \nDavid after he saw her naked in her bath, and killed her previous \nhusband, Uriah the Hittite (2 Samuel, 1 1). The Goddess Ishtar pre- \nsented herself naked to her would-be lovers, saying, "Let us enjoy thy \nmanly strength. Let thy hand [or, phallus] come forth and take away my \nvirginity." 33 \n\nSuch legends point to a custom of choosing a king by the \npromptness of his erection upon the sight of the naked Goddess. \nPeople would follow only a leader of proven sexual potency, as shown \nby the transparent sexual metaphors of the 1 10th Psalm: "The Lord \nshall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of \nthine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in I \nthe beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning; thou hast the \ndew of thy youth." Dew was the biblical word for semen, rod meant \nphallus, Zion was the Holy Mount, otherwise the body of the Virgin \nIsrael. \n\nWhen the king\'s youth and dew deserted him, so did his people, \nwho considered it dangerous to keep an impotent king in office. A \n\n\n\n504 \n\n\n\n*m \n\n\n\n[declining birth rate or a poor growing season could bring on a king- Kingship \n\nailing. Proverbs 14 says, "In the multitude of people is the king\'s \n\nnonor; but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince." \n\nNorthern Europeans believed in killing kings at the failure of their ^^^^^"^ \n%aefa or heill (virility, divine force), made manifest through failure of \ndie land\'s fertility. Crops went bad in the reign of Domaldi; his subjects \n:ried sacrificing oxen, then men, to no avail; finally they fell on the \nBang and butchered him. As late as the 9th century a.d., King Halfdan \nbf Norway was slain for the sake of the crops. 34 Writings falsely \nattributed to St. Patrick expressed the Celtic conviction that the reign of \na potent king would be distinguished by fine weather, calm seas, \nabundant grain, and trees laden with fruit. 35 \n\nCeremonial killing of kings was an ancient Latin custom, dating \n}ack to the obscure period of Roman history that is now virtually \nunknown, because later priesthoods destroyed its records. 36 Early Ro- \nman kings usually met death by "assassination" in the month of \nMarch, beginning the sacred year. 37 King Tatius was slain at the altar \nivith sacred knives: a suspiciously stylized death. Julius Caesar met a \nSimilarly ritualistic death at the fatal time, the Ides of March, in the \nt>acred inner chamber of the senate, on the very dais of the altar, in \nFulfillment of a prophetic announcement by his wife. \n\nThere is some doubt as to whether Caesar\'s wife was considered a \nportal woman or an embodiment of the Goddess whom Caesar wor- \nshipped for the sake of his victories in battle: Venus Genetrix. After \ndefeating Pompey, he built her a marble and gold temple in the \nForum and had his own statue placed before her as her consort. The \ndrama of his life and death contained elements common to other \nsacred kings who were consorts of the Goddess. \n\nAt the beginning of his career, Caesar dreamed of copulating with \nhis own mother, and the seers prophesied from this that he would \nrule the earth (Mother). On the eve of his assassination he attended a \nFeast or Last Supper and was asked, "What is the best kind of death?" \nHe replied, "The kind that is least expected." On the following day he \nreceived the kind of death he had chosen. Later, during the funerary \ngames in honor of Venus Genetrix, a comet was identified as the soul of \nPaesar enroute to the company of the gods. 38 \n\nJulius Caesar\'s successor Augustus received his title by marrying \nLivia Augusta, who planned the rebuilding programs in Rome and \nalso revitalized the worship of her Goddess, Juno Augusta. Though \nLivia\'s contributions to the glories of the Augustan Age have been \njelittled by Christian historians, there is no doubt that she was a full co- \n"uler and the real author of many of Augustus\'s legal reforms and \nmunicipal projects. There was a vague understanding, never fully \nnvestigated, that like the previous Caesar\'s wife, Livia somehow \n\'hastened her husband\'s end." 39 \n\nBy Roman law of matrilineal succession, Augustus was succeeded \n\n\n\n505 \n\n\n\nKingship by Tiberius, Livia\'s firstborn son by another man. The title of \n\nAugustus passed through the female line even up to the time of \nmmmmmmmm ^^^ mm Constantine, who received his throne through a marriage with the \nprincess Fausta. 40 \n\nThe title of Caesar (Kaiser, Czar) passed on to Germanic emper- \nors in the Dark Ages when legends of heroes and sacred kings usually \nincluded the ritual death. Siegfried suffered a typical Caesar\'s death, \nbrought on by his wife\'s prophetic dream. His wife personally \nembroidered on his robe the cross marking the spot where the slayer\'s \nspear must strike. 41 \n\nSt. Caesarius, whose name meant "king," was another fictitious \nsaint based on the old custom of king-killing. He was the Kaiser slain \nas an embodiment of Apollo at Terracina. The man impersonating the \nking would run through lines of spectators and leap from a cliff, as the \nmythical saint was said to have done. 42 The festival of "St. Caesarius" \nwas All Hallows, the pagan holy day of ancestral ghosts (see \nHalloween). \n\nSimilar deification or sainthood seems to have been the purpose ol \nthe mysterious Liebestod (Love-Death) of Attila the Hun, who \nappears in the Germanic Nibelungen saga under the name of Atli or \nEtzel, in the company of other heroes such as Siegfried. Attila\'s last \nbride bore the name of Germanic death-goddess, Grimhild or Kriem- \nhild. According to Marcellinus, Grimhild killed Attila in their \nmarriage bed on their wedding night. 43 Other sources more euphemisti \ncally said he died suddenly in the arms of his bride, smothered by "an \neffusion of blood." That his killing might have been deliberately \nplanned, to make him a god, is suggested by his burial with all the \ntrappings of a sacred Caesar: a triple coffin of sun, moon, and earth \nmetals gold, silver, and iron. His gravediggers were all slain so his \ntomb would be kept secret. 44 His funeral rites consisted of a brief period \nof extravagant mourning, followed by a joyful feast representing his \napotheosis. His future Second Coming was expected. \n\nMen who played the fatal role of the king in classic sacred dramas \nwere often deified (canonized) to induce them to serve as surrogates \nfor the real king. Like Christian martyrs, they believed that once past th \n"veil," they would enjoy blissful immortality, identified like the ruler \nwith the supreme god himself. Thus, many stories show men willingly \nassuming the fatal role. Antinous, a favorite of the emperor Hadrian, \nsacrificed himself in a magical ceremony to preserve the emperor\'s \nlife. 45 Each winter, the Roman festival of the Saturnalia featured a \nman who played the part of the Lord of Death, identified with both the \nemperor and the god Saturn. 46 The latter was the Heavenly Father in \nhis underground, "slain" aspect, as Shava the Corpse stood for Father \nShiva in the same attitude of death. See Shiva. \n\nThe Roman word for a king, rex or reg, descended from Sanskrit \nraj, as did the Celtic rig.* 7 Not only the word but the concept of the \n\n\n\n506 \n\n\n\noffice migrated all over the Eurasian continent, making a king\'s sover- Kingship \n\neignty dependent on his acceptance by the land, which was always \n\nembodied in women. The idea is still discernible in a Tartar custom: a ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nchief\'s son must be carried about to every village and suckled by \n\nevery nursing mother to validate his later claim to leadership. 48 The land \n\nwas a king\'s eternal mother-bride. King James I of England referred \n\nto a tradition of immemorial antiquity when he said, "I am the husband \n\nand the whole island is my lawful wife." 49 The Welsh long believed \n\nthe British isles were annexed to Rome only through a sacred marriage \n\nbetween the Roman emperor and the British queen, the Lily Maid \n\nElen. Welsh bards also said their own Llefelys became king of France \n\nby marrying the queen and gaining "the crown of the kingdom along \n\nwith her." 50 \n\nLike early kings of Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Greece, and Rome, \npre-Christian British kings became stewards of the country through a \nhieros gamos with the queen. The Danish historian Saxo Grammati- \ncus said of Hermutrude, queen of Scotland, that "whomsoever she \nthought worthy of her bed was at once a king, and she yielded her \nkingdom with herself." 51 Pictish kings were selected by the royal \nwomen from a matrilineal blood line. Early Saxon queens governed \ntheir land, and a king could govern only by marrying them. 52 That is \nwhy King Canute married the widow of his predecessor; and Ethelbald, \nking of the West Saxons, married his father\'s widow. Another \nEthelbald, king of Kent, married his stepmother after his father\'s \ndeath. 53 \n\nBritish romances show kings unable to rule unless they possessed \nthe queen, whose name was often given as Guinevere also ren- \ndered Cunneware, Gwenhwyfar, Jennifer, Ginevra, or Genevieve. \nSome early sources say there were three of her (the Triple Goddess). \nKing Arthur married all three. 54 Repeated abductions of her by Melea- \ngant, by Lancelot, by Melwas, by Arthur, and by Mordred signified \nmany would-be kings\' claim to sovereignty. 55 The collapse of Arthur\'s \nkingdom was intimately related to his loss of the queen. \n\nIn pagan Ireland a king\'s inaugural greeting announced that he \nwas wedded to (literally, had copulated with) his land, in the person \nof the queen. The legendary Irish Queen Mab, famous in folklore as \nthe Fairy Queen, chose and invested her kings and changed her \nlovers often. 56 \n\nRivalries between kings ruler and tanist, father and son, royal \n"dragon" and his dragonslayer preserve in mythology the arche- \ntypal sexual jealousy that related male power to acceptance by the \nfemale, and male powerlessness to sexual rejection. The myth of \nFinn and Diarmuid plainly shows the chieftains\' jealous counter-claims \nto Queen Grianne (Ygraine), another form of Guinevere. King \nArthur\'s death scene was prefigured by the story of Finn\'s three trips to \nbring healing waters to the wounded Diarmuid; but each time he \n\n\n\n507 \n\n\n\nKingu deliberately let the water trickle through his fingers, so Diarmuid died. \n\nKiss Finn said smugly to his younger, handsomer rival: "Well it pleases \n\n^ m ^ m f^ me, O Diarmuid, to see you in this plight, and it grieves me only that all \nthe women of Erin are not now gazing on you; for your extraordinary \nbeauty is now ugliness, and your choice form a deformity." 57 \n\nAn old English custom of "lifting" the king at Easter time suggests \nthe former importance of women in every aspect of the king\'s career, \nincluding his selection, approval, love-death, and apotheosis. The king \nwas heaved up into the air each year by a group of court ladies. \nThough piously called an imitation of "our Savior\'s resurrection," the \ncustom was obviously older than Christianity; it was pagan, not \nChristian, theology that made gods and kings one and the same, both \nsubject to the magic of women. 58 \n\nX.Assyr. & Bab.

In Germany and Austria even up to the ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n19th century a.d. it was common for mothers to premasticate food \n\nand feed it to their infants by "kissing." l Kissing was most common in \n\nEuropean countries, where it was supposed to create a bond among \n\nall members of a clan (hence, "kissing cousins"). It was virtually \n\nunknown in northern Asia (Japan, China, Mongolia). Amerindians \n\nand Eskimos did not kiss but rather inhaled the breath of a loved one by \n\n"rubbing noses." \n\nl.Wickler, 191, 237-38. \n\n\n\nKnighthood; Ceremony of \n\nIn the Middle Ages, a knight was created by a symbolic imitation of \nthe ritual that used to make a man into a god: beheading him. Touching \nfirst one shoulder then the other with a sword implied that the sword \nhad passed through the neck. Celtic tribes especially revered man-gods \nwho were preserved in the form of severed heads, which were \nbelieved to give oracles. In Greece also, savior-gods like Orpheus spoke \nto their followers of the after-life through the mouths of their own \nmummified heads. Symbolic beheading also "knighted" men dedicated \nto the Goddess Artemis in her Spartan shrines, where the man so \ndedicated received a slight cut in his neck from the edge of a sword. 1 \n\n1. Graves, CM. 2, 79. \n\n\n\nKnights Templar \n\nThe Order of Knights of the Temple was founded in the Holy Land \nin 1118 a.d. by a Burgundian knight, Hugues de Payens or Payns, that \nis, "Hugh of the Pagans." \' Its organization was based on that of the \nSaracen fraternity of hashishim, "hashish-takers," whom Christians \ncalled Assassins (see Aladdin). 2 The Templars\' first headquarters \nwas a wing of the royal palace of Jerusalem next to the al-Aqsa mosque, \nrevered by the Shi\'ites as the central shrine of the Goddess Fatima. 5 \n\nWestern romances, inspired by Moorish Shi\'ite poets, transformed \nthis Mother-shrine into the Temple of the Holy Grail, where certain \nlegendary knights called Templars gathered to offer their service to the \nGoddess, to uphold the female principle of divinity and to defend \nwomen. (See Grail, Holy.) These knights became more widely known \nas Galahad, Perceval, Lohengrin, etc. \n\nThe real Knights Templar, however, professed Christianity and \nassumed the duty of protecting Christian pilgrims and merchants \ntraveling through the Holy Land. They also undertook to protect the \ntravelers\' lands, castles, and other properties back home, where \n\n\n\n509 \n\n\n\nKnights Templar Templars from Jerusalem arrived to take charge. When pilgrims failed \n\nto return from their journeys, the property could pass into the \n^^^^^^^^^^ m Templars\' permanent possession. As a result, like other holy orders \nfounded on a vow of poverty, the Templars soon became very rich. \n\nAt first the Knights Templar had difficulty getting papal sanction \nfor their military order. The papacy refused to recognize them until a \nvindication of their aims was written by St. Bernard, whose uncle joined \nthe order and became a Grand Master. The Templars\' original \ncharter, signed by Pope Innocent II, granted them freedom from papal \nclaims on their property, even from church taxation. This financial \nindependence was to prove their downfall. \n\nHaving acquired estates and treasure houses throughout France, \nSpain, Portugal, and the Levant, the Templars were leading bankers \nand moneylenders of the 13 th century. They served kings and mer- \nchant princes. Their own treasure ships plied the eastern \nMediterranean coasts. Their reputation for honesty was such that even \nMoslems trusted them. Eventually, Pope Clement V and King Philip \nIV of France, whose government was nearly bankrupt, joined forces to \ndeprive the Templars of their money and their lives. \n\nEarly in the 14th century, the Templars were accused of orga- \nnized heresy, devil worship, ritual sodomy, and blasphemy. It was \nclaimed they adored an androgynous idol named Baphomet, "having \nsometimes three faces, sometimes two, or only one, and sometimes a \nbare skull, which they called their savior, and believed its influence to be \nexerted in making them rich, and in making flowers grow and the \nearth germinate." 4 \n\nThe rumor-mongers claimed the Templars\' secret rites involved \ndenial of Christ, treading on the cross, forcing initiates into homosex- \nual acts, kissing the devil\'s genitals, and similar charges that were to \nbecome monotonously familiar in witch persecutions. Grand Master \nJacques de Molay and other dignitaries of the order were arrested and \nconfessed under torture that they had indeed done such things, with \nthe aim of teaching newly initiated Knights unquestioning obedience to \ntheir superiors\' commands. Later, Molay and his associates publicly \nrenounced their confessions, saying they had been forced by torture. In \n13l4 they proclaimed their innocence before a large crowd of people \nand were burned at the stake as relapsed heretics the same afternoon. 5 \n\nThe order was suppressed with great cruelty. With the church\'s \nblessing, local barons in France, Cyprus, Castile, and other areas \nsimply murdered the Knights and took their properties. Captured \nTemplars were forced to confess to every sort of crime, most \napparently invented by their judges. It was found that each Templar \nconfessed to one set of sins when tortured by one judge and a \ncompletely different set when tortured by a different judge. 6 Trials were \ntransparently rigged. During the trial of Templars at Paris, the court \nrepeatedly refused to hear depositions from no fewer than 573 witnesses \nfor the defense. 7 \n\n\n\n510 \n\n\n\nA few Templars managed to flee to England, where torture was Knot \n\ni not legal. This made it impossible to obtain what Pope Clement \n\ncalled "true evidence," meaning evidence extorted by torture. The ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nI pope wrote to King Edward II, demanding that the Templars be \n; arrested and tortured. Otherwise, Edward and his court would be \nexcommunicated as impeders of the Inquisition. As a bribe, Edward \nwas offered a Plenary Indulgence for all his past sins. Finally he \nj permitted papal judges to torture the Templars, changing the English \nI law "out of reverence for the Holy See." 8 The indispensable utility of \nItorture was thus established, and "the success of the extermination of \nthe Templars set the patterns for the subsequent persecution of \nI witches." 9 \n\nScholars have tried to determine the truth, if any, of the charges \njagainst the Templars. Most agree that the Templars "had adopted \nsome of the mysterious tenets of the eastern Gnostics." 10 Their alleged \nidol Baphomet may have been the Triple Head of Wisdom pictured \nion the arms of the order\'s founder, in the form of three black Saracen \nheads. 11 On the other hand, no idol of Baphomet was ever found in \nkhe Templars\' houses or shrines, though these were seized and sealed \nimmediately. 12 \n\nTemplars were accused of "making a fig" at the crucifix with their \npands; but this derisive sexual symbol was not a mockery by eastern \nstandards. Orientals called it a knowledge sign, the feminine counterpart \npf the phallic cross; in India it was a lingam-yoni. 1? If the Templars \ntrampled a crucifix, they may have copied the custom of Arab dervishes \nIvho ceremonially rejected a cross with the words, "You may have the \nCross, but we have the meaning of the Cross." H As for the charge of \nBodomy, no monastic order was free of that. Men cut off from \nLvomen were no less prone to homosexual behavior in the 13th century \nman in the prisons, barracks, lumber and mining camps, and boys\' \nSchools of the 20th. \n\nI. Shah, xix. 2.

Marriage is still called "tying the knot" because it \nused to be viewed as a binding of two life-threads by the Goddess \nAphrodite, or Juno. Egyptians\' Isis-Hathor bound or loosed the lives of \nmen with Tat, the Knot of Fate, and taught the art of making magic \nInots. Sometimes she bore the title of the knot itself, Tait. High-ranking \nEgyptians were promised she would personally weave their cere- \nments, including "bandages from the hand of Tait." l In Egypt, holy \nmysteries in general were shetat, "she-knots." 2 \n\n\n\n511 \n\n\n\nKnot The Knot of Fate came into Greek myth as the famous Gordian \n\nKnot severed by the sword of Alexander, in fulfillment of the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^m prophecy that whoever could "unravel" the knot would become lord of \nall Asia. The original knot was the marriage tie of Phrygia\'s sacred \nking, alternately Gordius or Midas, sons and bridegrooms of the Magna \nMater. The knot was fastened to the yoke of the oxcart on which \nGordius entered into his kingdom, as the oracle announced in terms \nsimilar to the Bible\'s description of Jesus\'s triumphal entry into \nJerusalem: "Phrygians, your new king is approaching with his bride, \nseated in an ox-cart!" 3 \n\nPagan religions related the art of knotting to "binding" and \n"loosing" the forces of creation and destruction, the same power \nclaimed by the papacy for the alleged heirs of St. Peter (Matthew \n16:19). (See Peter, Saint.) The windings of Fate and the mysteries \nof Nature were often symbolized by elaborate knotwork, as in the \nintricate knot-patterns of Scandinavian and Saracenic monuments. \n\nWitches of Finland, Lapland, and the northern islands bound the \nwinds in magic knots and sold them to credulous sailors, who would \nuse the knots to try to control the winds at sea, as Odysseus\'s sailors did \nwith Aeolus\'s bag of winds. Such magic was still common in the late \n16th century. 4 Scottish witches were said to raise winds and storms by \nsoaking a knotted rag in water and beating it on a stone to make drops \nfly like rain, saying: \n\nIknok this rag upone this stane \n\nTo raise the wind in the divellis name \n\nIt sail not lye till I please againe. 5 \n\nIn 1814 Sir Walter Scott found one Bessie Millie selling "winds \nby the devil\'s help" to sailors in the form of knotted cords. 6 British \nwitches claimed to stop nosebleeds by tying knots in red thread, the \nclassic Fate-weaver\'s blood symbol. 7 Weaver\'s thread was also thought \nto cure "diseases of the groin" when knotted with a widow\'s name \npronounced at each knot. 8 On the other hand, witches could make men \nimpotent with a magic knot called "ligature." Predictably, men said \nthis was a "detestable impiety" deserving the death penalty. According \nto a canon of the church, God\'s opinion was self-contradictory. \nLigature could occur only with God\'s permission and could be cured \nonly "with God\'s help." 9 \n\nThe Jews so feared magic knots that rabbinic law forbade tying any \nknots on the Sabbath; though one rabbi said it was legal to tie a knot \nthat could be untied with one hand. 10 Moslems said Mohammed nearly \ndied of a sickness prepared by Jewish witches with a "cord of knots," \nwhich was discovered in time to save his life. The knots were loosened \nby speaking verses of the Koran. Moslems still believe that Surah \nCXIII of the Koran will stop "the evil of women who are blowers on \nknots." 11 \n\nKnot magic is performed by the Mexican recibidora (midwife) in \n\n\n\n512 \n\n\n\ncomplicated tyings of umbilical cords. 12 Greeks still remember the Kobolds \n\nlife-knots of the Moerae, saying of a dead man, "his thread is cut." ,J Koran \n\nThe same triple Fates govern the "Nordic Knot" of three interlock- ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ning triangles, known as the Knot of the Vala. 14 Formed of three \nfemale-genital symbols, this invoked the Great Vala (Freya) who \nwove the fates of men. \n\n1.

Their name descended from \nGreek kaballoi, horse-riders, which formerly referred to "Amazo- \nnian" tribes led by the Goddess. She was called Oberon\'s spouse, \nTitania, queen of the Titans who were, of course, the earth-giants \nworshipped by pre-Hellenic Pelasgian peoples, who resisted the Olym- \npian gods. 1 Similarly the kobolds lived underground, and resisted the \nrule of new celestial deities. \n\nl.deGivry, 315. \n\n\n\nKoran \n\nMohammedan scriptures, often erroneously thought to have been \n\nwritten by Mohammed. Moslems don\'t believe this. 1 But many don\'t \nI know the Koran was an enlarged, revised version of the ancient \nI Word of the Goddess Kore, revered by Mohammed\'s tribe, the \n\nKoreshites (Children of Kore), who guarded her shrine at Mecca. \nThe original writing was done long before Mohammed\'s time by \n\nholy imams, a word related to Semitic ima, "mother." 2 Like the \n(original mahatmas or "great mothers" in India, the original imams were \nIprobably priestesses of the old Arabian matriarchate. It was said they \n(took the scriptures from a prototype that existed in heaven from the \n(beginning of eternity, "Mother of the Book" i.e., the Goddess \n(herself, wearing the Book of Fate on her breast as Mother Tiamat wore \nthe Tablets of Destiny. Sometimes the celestial Koran was called the \n[(Preserved Tablet. 3 There was some resemblance between this and other \nlegendary books of divine origin, such as the Ur-text, the Book of \nIrhoth, and the Emerald Tablet of Hermes. \n\nAs in the case of the Judeo-Christian Bible, the Koran was much \nliewritten to support new patriarchal laws and to obliterate the figures \n|)f the Goddess and her priestesses. See Arabia. \n\n1. Encyc. Brit., "Mohammed." 2. Campbell, Oc.M., 443. 3. Budge, A.T., 52. \n\n\n\n513 \n\n\n\nKore \n\n\n\nNeolithic Asia knew \na mysterious Goddess \nKer, or Car, \nancestress of the \nCarians. 1 Her city in \nthe Chersonese was \nCardia, "the \nGoddess Car." Kardia \nbecame the Greek \nword for "heart," as cor \nbecame the Latin; \nboth descended from \nthe Goddess who \nwas the world-heart. \nThe same syllable is \nfound in words for \nmaternal blood \nrelationships: Gaelic \ncairdean, kinship; \nTurkish kardes, \nmaternal siblings. 2 \nThe Goddess became \nKardia ton kosmos: \n"Heart of the World." 5 \n\n\n\nKore \n\nGreek Holy Virgin, inner soul of Mother Earth (Demeter); a name \nso widespread, that it must have been one of the earliest designations of \nthe World Shakti or female spirit of the universe. Variations include \nKer, Car, Q\'re, Cara, Kher, Ceres, Core, Sanskrit Kaur or Kauri, \nalternate names for the Goddess Kali. \n\nShrines of Karnak in Egypt and Carnac in Brittany were sites of \ngigantic temples and funerary complexes over 5000 years ago, \ndedicated to Kar or Kore. France had similar shrines in similarly-named \nlocations, Kerlescan, Kercado, Kermario. 4 The last name combined \nthe pagan Virgin with the Goddess Mari, who was sometimes her \ndaughter, her mother, or herself, like Kali embodied in Kel-Mari. 5 \nInhabitants of Carnac, and of Carnuntum on the Danube, called \nthemselves in Roman times the Carnutes, "people born of the \nGoddess Car." 6 \n\nIn Egypt\'s early dynastic period there was a place called Kerma \n(Mother Ker) in Nubia, where mass sacrifices took place. A similar \nname, Kara, was held in reverence by several early Egyptian rulers. \nEgyptians spoke of an eastern land called Kher, and called Palestine \nthe country of Kharu. 7 \n\nCar or Carna was known to the Romans as "a Goddess of the \nolden time," whose archaic worship was connected with Karneia \nfestivals of Sparta and the classic Roman Carnival. 8 Sometimes she was \nCarmenta, "the Mind of Car," who invented the Roman alphabet. 9 \nAn extremely old temple on the Caelian Hill was dedicated to her. 10 A \nlater variation of her name was Ceres, origin of such words as cereal, \ncorn, kernel, core, carnal, cardiac. \n\nIn the east this ancient Goddess was everywhere. Some said she \nwas Artemis Caryatis, mother of the Caryatides of the Laconian \ntemple of Caryae. 11 The Tyrian seaport of Caraalis (modern Cagliari) \nwas sacred to her. 12 One of Israel\'s oldest shrines, the "garden" called \nMount Carmel, was her place and that of her baalim (gods). 13 \n\nKore was a great power in Coptic religion, with a flourishing cult at \nAlexandria in the 4th century a.d. Her festival, the Koreion, was held \neach January 6, later assimilated to Christianity as the feast of Epiphany. \nKore\'s festival celebrated the birth of the new year god Aeon to the \nVirgin, whose naked image was carried seven times around the temple, \ndecorated with gold stars and the sign of the cross. The priests \nannounced to the public that the Virgin had brought forth the Aeon. 14 \n\nThe Koreion passed into British tradition as the Kirn, or Feast of \nIngathering, which the church later changed to the Feast of Our \nLady of Mercy. Kirn was a cognate of the Greek kern or sacred womb- \nvase in which the grain god was reborn. 15 Here again the Kore or Ker \nwas a virgin mother. The Goddess\'s harvest instrument, a moon-sickle, \nrepresented even the Christian version of the festival. 16 \n\nThe classic myth of Kore\'s abduction by Pluto was another \n\n\n\n514 \n\n\n\ninstance of a god\'s usurpation of the Goddess\'s power, according to \nGnostic sources.

They would pray: "I come to thee, little water-mother, \nwith head bowed and repentant. Forgive me, pardon me and ye, too, \nancestors and forefathers of the water."

Centuries later, some accounts declared it was the sign of the \ncross that Constantine saw in the sky. The earliest descriptions \ncontradict this. The labarum was not the sign of the cross; it didn\'t \nappear in the sky; it was not even a Christian symbol. \nW% Lactantius said the emperor was "directed in a dream to cause a \n\n^^JZ^ heavenly sign to be marked on the shields of his soldiers ... the letter \n\n^^^^^ X with a perpendicular line through it, turned over at the top." This was \n\nin fact the emblem of the soldiers\' god Mithra, whose worship was \n\nmost popular in the legions. 1 Christians struggling to Christianize this \n\nLabarum sign claimed it was formed of the letters chi and rho, for Christos. \n\nHowever, a series of holy signs from Philae show that the labarum \nevolved from the Egyptian ankh. 2 \n\nPious hagiographers of the Middle Ages paid no attention to \nLactantius. They declared that Constantine saw in the sky "the \nimage of a cross described in shining light; and above the image was \nwritten in letters of gold the legend: \'In this sign shalt thou con- \nquer!\'" 3 This was the orthodox Christian myth, which survived. \n\nThere were other forms of the labarum or Chrismon (Christ- \nmonogram). Most common today is the combination of letters IHS, \noften with a cross surmounting the H. This is called a signum dei, \nsupposed to mean Iesus Hominum Salvator, "Jesus, Savior of Man." \nTaylor said the same letters had a mystic meaning in Orphic resurrec- \ntion cults, where they were not Latin but Greek letters: iota, eta, \nsigma. \n\nIHS are Greek characters, by ignorance taken for Roman letters; \nand Yes, which is the proper reading of those letters, is none other than \nthe very identical name of Bacchus, that is, of the Sun, of which Bacchus \nwas one of the most distinguished personifications; and Yes, or IES, \nwith the Latin termination US added to it, is Jesus. The surrounding rays \nof glory, as expressive of the sun \'s light, make the identity of Christ and \nBacchus as clear as the sun. * \n\nAccording to another interpretation, confusing Constantine\'s \nbiography with the Mithraic-Christian labarum, the letters meant in hoc \nsigno (in this sign), and the cross was a magical command: "Con- \nquer!" Yet another tradition confused the labarum with the \nAlpha-and-Omega cross, with the Greek letters of creation and \ndestruction on its right and left arms. 5 This was a further adaptation of \nvery ancient matriarchal symbols; for Omega was the letter of the \ndestroying Moon-goddess, and Alpha was the sacred river of her blood \nthat gave birth to all things.

When a male priesthood took \nj over the Goddess\'s shrine at Delphi, founded by Cretan "Amazons," \nj they adopted the labrys also and gave themselves the title of Labryadae, \nI "ax-bearers." The title was still used in classical times. 1 It may have \n< been based on a traditional male scepter-bearer in the Goddess\'s \nI processions in earlier centuries, perhaps even the sacred youth \nhimself, consecrated to the hieros gamos, and displaying a "phallic" \n! symbol of his imminent union and sacrifice. \n\nIn modern times the labrys has been adopted by lesbians as a \nI symbol of reminiscence, in jewelry or art, of the all-female com- \nmunity of Lesbos and its founding mothers who worshipped only the \nj Goddess in nature and in each other. \n\n1.

The classic Labyrinth was \nthe palace of Minos, "Moon-king," whose spirit dwelt in the sacred \nbull, the Minotaur or Moon-bull, a Cretan form of Apis, who was \nsimilarly sacrificed in Egypt. 1 Minos was a Lord of Death and an \nunderworld judge, a western counterpart of the Hindu Moon-bull \nYama, who functioned in the same way. 2 \n\nThe mystic meaning of a labyrinthine design was a journey into \nthe otherworld and out again, like the sacred king\'s cyclic journeys \ninto death and rebirth. Early labyrinthine designs on coins, caves, tombs, \netc. referred to the earth-womb. The classic labyrinth was not a maze \nto get lost in; it had only one path, traversing all parts of the figure. Such \nlabyrinths were meant for ceremonial walking, "almost always con- \nnected with a cave. ... In those cases where the ritual has been \npreserved, the labyrinth itself, or a drawing of it, is invariably situated \nat the entrance of the cave or dwelling." 5 \n\nLabyrinth-games were played by witches for ceremonial purposes. \nSome descended to the nursery level, like the game Troy Town still \nplayed by children on a pattern of seven labyrinthine circles cut in sod. 4 \n\nSome labyrinths were taken over by Christian churches and \nincorporated into floor patterns, gardens, or hedges. Some were \ninsinuated into church designs by masonic brotherhoods as secret \nGnostic symbols. Chartres Cathedral had a labyrinth with the six- \nlobed device of Aphrodite at its center. The path of the labyrinth was \nexactly 666 feet long, Aphrodite\'s sacred number. 5 (See Hexagram.) \nThe central lotus once bore the names of the master builders, who \n\n\n\nus \n\n\n\nLabyrinth \n\n\n\n523 \n\n\n\nLachesis \nLadder \n\n\n\nperhaps hoped to achieve immortality by the Gnostic name-magic. \nBut the names have been erased. 6 \n\n1.

The Book of the Dead said a pharaoh \nmight become Lord of the Ladder, assisted into heaven by a prayer that \nhe was taught: "Homage to thee, O divine Ladder. Homage to thee, \nO Ladder of Set! Stand thou upright, O divine Ladder. Stand thou \nupright, O Ladder of Set! Stand thou upright, O Ladder of Horus, \nwhereby Osiris appeared in heaven when he used the words of power o \nRa." 1 \n\nThe dead king\'s subjects were assured that "the gods made a ladder \nfor (him) that he might ascend to heaven on it." The king\'s funerary \ninscriptions said, "I set up a ladder to heaven among the gods." 2 \n\nThe ladder to heaven was a relic of shamanistic death-rebirth \nceremonies. It was ascended by kings, prophets, sages, bodhisattvas, anc \nother Enlightened Ones, the "angels" on the ladder in Jacob\'s dream \n(Genesis 28:12). Among central Asian tribes the "soul ladder" was a \npost fixed on the grave, with fourteen notches representing the "steps" \nor days of the moon in ascent. A similar Heavenly Ladder was made in ! \nIndia with wooden sword blades, which the priest must climb to perforrj \nsacramental decapitation of a white cock at the top. Chinese shamans ol \nhigh priests ascended a ladder of knives, walking barefoot on the edges \nas an initiatory ordeal. 3 \n\nPriest-kings in antiquity climbed soul-ladders to meet the Goddess) \n\n\n\n524 \n\n\n\nj&T: \n\n\n\nbn the occasion of their hieros gamos and also after death, when their \nfcouls returned to the Mother who bore them. Sometimes the ladder was \nberceived as a familiar passageway between the Goddess in heaven and \nper consort the king on earth. Kosingas of Thrace controlled his subjects \npy threatening to ascend his special wooden ladder to the Great \nGoddess Hera, to complain to her of their conduct and invoke her \nLvrath on them. 4 \n\nAs a rule the soul-ladder passed through the seven heavens, like \nme axis rnundi in Gnostic cosmology. Celsus said initiates into the \nMithraic Mysteries climbed a klimaxox ladder of seven rungs. 5 The first \n[ung was lead for Saturn, the second tin for Venus, the third bronze for \nlupiter, the fourth iron for Mercury, the fifth "monetary alloy" for \nMars, the sixth silver for the moon, and the seventh gold for the sun. At \nthe top, a platform represented the sphere of the fixed stars, the \nEmpyrean. 6 \n\nAs a symbol of ecstatic initiatory ascents in the sacred Mysteries, \n[he ladder was carried over into Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \nMohammed\'s vision like Jacob\'s was "a ladder rising from the temple in \nJerusalem (pre-eminently the \'Center\') to heaven, with angels to right \npnd left; on this ladder the souls of the righteous mounted to God." 7 \nBoth Jacob\'s ladder and Mohammed\'s were based on much earlier \nEgyptian representations of the pharaoh being welcomed into heaven \nby the gods, who helped him up the last rungs of his ascent. 8 Like the \nladders of Set, Osiris, and Buddha, the ladder of the pharaoh had 14 \n[tteps, alluding to the waxing days of the lunar cycle. Another 14 steps \n[represented the descending part of the cycle, into the underworld and \nIpack. \n\nThere were many "ladder-saints" in Syria and Persia during the \nffth century a.d., when ladder-sitting or pillar-sitting became a fad \n[among holy hermits. St. Simeon Stylites was a famous Christian pillar- \nlaint, glorified for remaining motionless so long that his living limbs \nDeveloped gangrene. One of his followers and admirers was named St. \nBadoth (Persian Schiadurte). The legend of this saint said he saw a \ni\'ision of Simeon at the top of heaven-reaching ladder, calling down to \nliim, "Mount up, Sadoth; fear not! I mounted yesterday; it is your turn \n|oday." Shortly afterward, Sadoth was martyred and climbed up to \n|ieaven. 10 \n\nThe sacred klimax was so popular in Byzantine and Gnostic \nconography that it was even canonized as a bogus saint, John Clima- \nus. A mystical book supposed to have been written by him appeared at \nVlt. Sinai in the 7th century a.d., the Ladder to Paradise." This St. \nohn was said to have been an abbot at the Sinai monastery, but his \nurname suggested a Tantric adept. The klimax was more than a ladder; \nis its modern usage suggests, it was also an ascent to sexual bliss through \nnarriage with the Goddess. Some Gnostic sects were still using the \nadder as a symbol of the soul\'s marriage in the Middle Ages. \n\\.B<x>k<>ftheDead,lO\\. 2. Eliade, S., 489. 3.

Churchmen said Lammas \n\nmmaammmmmmmm^mm was one or " me witches\' four annual Great Sabbaths, based on the \nfour seasonal festivals of the pagan year. \n\n1. Brewster, 349. \n\n\n\nLancelot \n\nArthurian hero based on early Celtic conceptions of the phallic \nlightning god Lanceor, the Golden Lance, mated to Colombe, the \nDove, a northern version of Aphrodite Columba. 1 Like the Oriental \nvajra, meaning phallus, jewel, or lightning, Lanceor descended into the \nGoddess\'s abyssal womb to fertilize the world. Thus Plutarch stated \nthat Lightning was the impregnator of the Waters. 2 \n\nThough anthropomorphized in romance as a knight of the Round \nTable, Lancelot showed signs of his pagan origin: he was still the \nlover of the Mother, and the reincarnation of his own elder self. He lay \nwith Elaine, or Elen, or Helen, or Eileen, or Hel-Aine, the same \nGoddess worshipped at the Celtic lunar shrine of Cnoc Aine. 3 She was \nthe Weaver of Fate, and she made Lancelot invincible with her gift \nof a vaginal fetish, a red silk sleeve. She was also Lancelot\'s queen \nmother Elaine, who christened him Galahad, the same name given \nhis younger reincarnation or "son." The elder hero received the name \nLancelot when he was initiated by the Lady of the Lake in her magic \nLand of Women. 4 \n\nLike Osiris-Horus, Apollo-Heracles, Zeus-Zagreus, God-Jesus, \nand other versions of the ubiquitous father-son deity, Lancelot \nbecame a Lord of Death and a keeper of the paradise-castle, which \nappeared in the romances as Joyous Gard, the "Happy World." \nLancelot stole Arthur\'s queen, living symbol of the land of Britain, after \nrescuing her from a fiery death at the stake, on a conviction of \nwitchcraft. It was she who announced that Lancelot came from Jesus \nChrist in the 8th generation, while Galahad was of the 9th genera- \ntion. 5 Though medieval churchmen insisted that Jesus never begot \nchildren, the heathen bards continued to popularize the contrary \nbelief because it was the best way to account for the old concept of \nsuccessive reincarnations. \n\nLike many other figures of Celtic romance, Lancelot seems to \nhave developed out of Oriental Tantric traditions. He resembled the \nTantric saint Padma-sambhava, the Lake-Born Vajra, i.e., a phallic \nlightning-bolt reborn from the Water-Mother as Lady of the Lake. 6 \nThe Dove of the Sea was his mother-bride, symbol of the Abyss \n(Maria). Lancelot\'s name, "Big Lance," might be compared to the \nother primitive Tantric-Celtic hero Peredur Paladrhir, "Spearman with \na Long Shaft," which described the ithyphallic god in union with his \nGoddess. 7 \n\n\n\n528 \n\n\n\nLancelot\'s origin in Meidelant, "Land of Maidens," also suggests Lapis Manalis \n\nan early date and an Oriental root of his basic myth. 8 He suggested Lat \n\nKrishna who was raised by "holy women" in a sacred grove, and grew ^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\nup to be an eminently sexual god. 9 Lancelot was not a solar deity but \nthe rival of the sun god, represented by Gawain, with whom Lancelot \nfought a great battle, defeating him when his strength ebbed at the \nend of the solar day. \n\n1.

At the annual festival of \nMania, the Ancestral Moon-mother, the stone was removed and her \nchildren the manes or ghosts-of-ancestors were invited to join the feast. \nSometimes the festival was called Parentalia, since the ghosts in the \nunderworld were the same as the diparentes or "parent-gods" from past \nages. 1 \n\nNorthern Europeans celebrated the same kind of festival at Hal- \nloween or Samhain, also a feast to which ancestral ghosts were \ninvited. \n\n1. Lamusse, 213. \n\n\n\nLara \n\nShort name of the Roman Goddess Acca Larentia, mother of the \nlares or household spirits. She was honored at the annual Larentalia, a \nfestival inherited from pre-Roman times. See Akka. \n\n\n\nLat \n\nItalian latte, "milk," descended from the milk-giving Goddess Lat, \neponymous Mother of pre-Roman Latium. She was also Latona, or \nLeto, mother of the World Egg and the sun. 1 Arabs knew her as Al- \nLat, the Moon, later masculinized as the Islamic Allah. She was well \nknown in pre-dynastic Egypt. Herodotus called her "an archaic \nqueen of the Lower Kingdom." Hers was one of Egypt\'s oldest oracular \nshrines, which the Greeks knew as Latopolis. 2 To the Egyptians, this \nplace was Menhet, "House of the Moon." 5 \n\nLat was the Moon because the ancient world regarded the moon \nthe universal source of nourishment: a celestial Breast that pro- \nduced the Milky Way. From the moon came water, milk, blood, plant \nsap, and all other life-supporting fluids. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n529 \n\n\n\nLeda Lat was the foundress of Latin matriarchal culture. The old word \n\nLeft Hand latifundia meant parcels of land allotted to clan matriarchs by the \n\n^^^^^i^^ Goddess herself. 4 See Matrilineal Inheritance. The island of Malta \n\nwas once Ma Lata, "Mother Lat." \n\nIn 1428, the church totally destroyed an Italian town whose \n\nresidents were suspected of heretical opinions. Oddly enough, the \n\ntown was named Magnalata: "Great Lat." \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 318. 2. Larousse, 29. 3. Budge, G.E. 2, 50. \n4. Cumont, M.M., 74. \n\n\n\nLeda \n\n"Lady" or "Woman," another name of the Goddess Lat, who laid \nthe World Egg and hatched Castor and Pollux, the morning and \nevening stars; and Helen, the earthly incarnation of the Moon- \ngoddess; and Clytemnestra, who was to Mycenae as Helen was to Troy. \nMythographers confused Leda with Nemesis, who coupled with \nZeus when he took the form of a swan-king. Thus she became the \nfamous Goose that Laid the Golden Egg (the sun, Apollo) under her \nother name, Leto. 1 To the Egyptians, this was the Nile Goose, Hathor. \nA favorite theme of medieval artists was the coupling of Leda with \nthe swan-god, which permitted an erotic subject to be shown without \ninvolvement of a human male figure. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,207. \n\n\n\nLeft Hand \n\nLatin sinister, "left," came to mean diabolic, witchlike; dexter, \n"right," yielded dextrous, meaning skilful or clever. Ambidextrous is \nliterally "two right hands." Right-ness is associated with righteous- \nness, rectitude, rectification, good right hand, adroitness (from French a \ndroite, "to the right"). Left is gauche, clumsy or stupid, with its \nEnglish derivatives gawk, gawky. Italian mancino, "left," means deceit- \nful. German link, "left," means wrong, backward, perverse. \nAnglo-Saxon lyft meant weak or worthless. The evil eye was said to be \nthe left one. 1 According to the Brahmans, left-handedness goes \nagainst the grain of decency. 2 Jewish mystics said God\'s left hand is the \nhand that destroys. Satanael or Sammael the death-god personifies \nGod\'s left side. 3 The Gospel of Nicodemus said the thief crucified at \nJesus\'s right hand received the kingdom of heaven; the thief crucified \nat his left hand was damned. 4 Superstitious folk still believe it\'s lucky to \nsee the new moon over one\'s right shoulder but disastrous to see it \nover the left. 5 \n\nSagan asks, "In the worldwide associations of the words \'right\' and \n\'left\' there is evidence of a rancorous conflict early in the history of \nmankind. What could arouse such powerful emotions?" 6 \n\n\n\n530 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else, indeed, but patriarchs\' battle of the sexes? \n\nAll myths agree that the right side was male, the left side female. \nWherever the deity was an androgyne, this arrangement was fol- \nowed. Typical was the Hindu bisexual deity Bhava, "Existence," with a \nwoman\'s left side and a man\'s right, signifying "man together with \nMature" and showing that all Existence is made up of two sexes. \n\\ndrogynous idols of Kali and Shiva showed the same arrangement. 7 \n\nGreek Pelopids tattooed themselves with a female symbol on the \nleft shoulder in honor of maternal ancestry, a male symbol on \nthe right shoulder for paternal ancestors. Egyptians said the left hand \n^represented the Goddess Maat, the right hand her consort Thoth. \nBabylonians prayed: "Let my goddess stand at my left hand! Let my god \nistand at my right hand!" 8 \n\nThe Jews said the seed of female children emanated from a father\'s \nleft testicle, while that of male children emanated from his right \ntesticle. 9 This ancient belief persisted among Christians even up to the \npresent century. In 1891 a book entitled Essentials of Conception \nsaid a man could "progenate a male or female child at will, by putting \nan elastic band around the testicle not required. Semen from the right \ntesticle progenates male, whilst that from the left female children." 10 \n\nAccording to some rabbinical traditions, the left hand of God was \n1 {female, which may have been why patriarchs thought it necessary not \n|to let "thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth" (Matthew 6:3). \nRabbis taught that "A wise man\'s heart is at his right hand: but a \n(fool\'s heart is at his left" (Ecclesiastes 10:2). Matriarchal societies \nbelieved the menstrual blood that made a child in a mother\'s womb \nwas her heart\'s blood, engendered on the left side of the body; but the \npatriarchs displaced the heart to the right. \n\nIn a sense, modern research has found some physical basis for \npelief in the left/female, right/male imagery of the ancients. The left \nhemisphere of the brain, which controls the right side of the body, is said \nto evolve logical thought sequences and suppress sensory input that \nmight interfere with problem solving. The right hemisphere, governing \nthe left side of the body, is called the intuitive, creative, or imaginative \npart of the brain. It is supposed to generate the more sensitive, broader \nawareness and response made manifest in feelings, empathy, fantasy, \nart, visual imagery, and inspiration: many of its qualities were belittled by \npatriarchal thinkers as incomprehensible "women\'s intuition." n This \nis an over-simplification, since both hemispheres work together in both \nfexes, and their functions are not neatly divisible. One half of a brain \ncould hardly exist without the other. \n\nIndia prized intuitive thinking somewhat more than logical think- \ning, and recognized two Ways to religious revelation: the male, solar, \nascetic "way to the gods" known as the Right-Hand Path; and the \nfemale, lunar, sensual way of the Goddess, known as Varna Marg or \nthe Left-Hand Path literally, the Female Way. 12 Tantric yogis recog- \nnized the left side of the body as the seat of every man\'s "female \nsoul" or shakti, with whom he would be united after death. In token of \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft Hand \n\n\n\nPelopids Tribes \nclaiming descent from \nPelops, a legendary \nsacred king sacrificed, \npartly devoured, and \nresurrected by Mother \nDemeter; inhabitants \nof the Peloponnese. \n\n\n\n531 \n\n\n\nLeft Hand reverence for the indwelling female soul, the yogis always entered a \n\nplace of worship with the left foot forward. 13 \nmm ^^^ mm ^^^^ m Europe\'s pagan customs, embodied in "witchcraft," maintained \n\nthe virtues of left-sidedness against prevailing patriarchal opinion. \nWitches said itching or burning of the left ear betokened joy in the near \nfuture, while the same sensations of the right ear meant sorrow. 14 \nWitches\' dances circled to the left, counterclockwise, moonwise, or \n"widdershins" as folk dances still do following the retrograde \nmotion of the moon instead of the clockwise motion of the sun. The \nmedieval church said dancing, turning, or circumambulating in this \ndirection was heresy. During the centuries of persecution, countless \npeople were burned alive for dancing widdershins, especially if they \nturned their backs to the center of the circle. Back-to-back dancing was \nevidently considered indecent, though widely practiced. 15 \n\nThe pagans were firmly in favor of the widdershins direction. Pre- \nChristian kings in Scandinavia were expected to lay magic circles of \nprotection around their cities by circumambulating them widdershins. \nIrish druidic law insisted on the same counterclockwise movement \naround the holy omphalos at Tara, shrine of Mother Earth: "Thou shalt \nnot go righthandwise around Tara." 16 Tantric influence also directed \nMiddle-Eastern Sufis to circumambulate their shrines in the widder- \nshins direction. 17 \n\nThe Christians reversed the direction of all turning charms, such \nas the divinatory magic of St. Andrew\'s Well on the isle of Lewis. \nSick pilgrims were told to float a wooden bowl on the waters. If the bowl \nturned sunwise, the patient understood that he would get well. If it \nturned moonwise, he would die. 18 \n\nWitches were said to make the sign of the cross with their left \nhands: another proof of heresy. The left-handed cross in graphic \nsymbolism was the Oriental moon-swastika, with arms pointing counter- \nclockwise, an emblem of Kali, as opposed to the sun-swastika, which \nrepresented male gods. 19 See Swastika. \n\nThe Scottish rite of handfasting was derived from a pagan-Oriental \nmarriage custom, incorporating the figure-eight Infinity sign that \nrepresented union of Kali and Shiva among Tantric yogis and yoginis. \nThe couple joined right hands to unite their "male" souls, then \njoined left hands to unite their "female" souls, forming the Infinity sign \nwith their arms thus crossed. 20 The sign itself is still used in modern \nmathematics, but handshakes are now exclusively and significantly \nright-handed. \n\nAnother Tantric sign of male-and-female unity was pressing the \npalms of the hands together, fingers upward: this meant two bodies \njoined as one. The gesture is still one of greeting and blessing among \nIndians. During the 12th and 13th centuries when Hindu religious \ncustoms were penetrating Europe, the gesture was adopted by Catharan \nheretics as the manibus junctis (hand-joining), which the orthodox \nchurch later took to itself. 21 Now it is the standard gesture of prayer, \nboth east and west. \n\n\n\n532 \n\n\n\nClassic traditions added still more support to the male-female \nimages of rightness and leftness. While giving birth to the sun and moon \n(Apollo and Artemis), the Goddess Leto grasped a male palm tree \nwith her right hand and a female olive tree with her left. 22 When giving \nbirth to Zeus, the Goddess Rhea placed her hands on the earth to \ncause five female spirits to spring up from her left handprint, and five \nmale spirits from her right handprint (see Fingers). The matriarchal \nmagic of Medusa was mythically symbolized: blood from her left side \ncould give rebirth to the dead; blood from her right side instantly \ndestroyed a human body. 25 The Romans still believed in the benevo- \nlence of the left side. Plutarch said it was a good omen to see an \naugury, such as a flying eagle, on one\'s left side; an evil omen to see it \non the right. 24 \n\nMen placed wedding rings on women\'s left hands to fetter their \nmagic power and hold their hearts. From the most ancient times, \nmen believed that a certain vessel or vein ran directly from a woman\'s \nheart to the fourth finger of her left hand. This was a remarkably \ndurable belief; Lemnius mentioned it as late as 1658. 25 \n\nAccording to heraldic symbolism, the bend sinister, a stripe slant- \ning to the left, signified bastardy or lack of a father. A warrior bearing \nthe bend sinister on his shield was therefore his mother\'s son only, after \nthe fashion of the heathen matrilineal clan. Fatherlessness was not \nconsidered a mark of dishonor until Christianity had established the \npatriarchal family system throughout Europe. \n\nRelated to the symbolism of the left and right hands was the \nsymbolism of east and west. Rome established the four cardinal points \nby a north-south line and an east-west line, decumanus. The eastern \nhalf was familiaris, the area of good omens and of the sun. The \nwestern half was hostilis, the area of evil omens and of the moon. 26 \nSince it was the custom to face the "still point" of the heavens the \nnorth celestial pole for orientation of buildings and towns, the left \nhand was to the west, the right hand to the east, as maps are still \nmade. To the west lay the Moon-land, home of the ancestral dead, \ncalled Westerners by the Chinese, Greeks, Celts, and Egyptians. 27 As \nlong ago as the Stone Age, the dead were buried facing west. "To go \nwest" has always been a synonym for "to die." Death meant a \njourney to the western gate of the Mother. Aztecs called the west "the \nplace of women," where human beings once crawled out of the \ngenital hole of Mother Earth, to which all the dead must return. 28 \n\nOn the other hand literally the east was the place of male solar \ngods greeted every morning with the formula, "He is risen." The \neastern sun-temple of Borsippa was known as the Temple of the Right \nHand. 29 The main avenue of Alexandria ran from the Gate of the \nSun on the east to the Gate of the Moon on the west. 30 The eastern abt \nof an Egyptian temple was the birthplace of the sun god Ra; the west \nwas the place of his dying. 31 This was probably the origin of the eastern \napse in a Christian church, which like the Egyptian abt was "orient- \ned" toward the east, birthplace of the sun. \n\n\n\nLeft Hand \n\n\n\nBorsippa Ancient \nsister city of Babylon, \nlocated about 1 5 \nmiles to the southwest; \nnow known as Birs \nNimrud. Borsippa \nflourished greatly in \nthe 7th and 6th \ncenturies B.C. It was \ndestroyed by Xerxes I in \nthe 5th, and partly \nrestored by Antiochus I \nin the 3rd. \n\n\n\n533 \n\n\n\nLegba \nLemnos \n\n\n\nBruce Papyrus Second- \ncentury Gnostic \nmanuscript \ndiscovered at Nag \nHammadi in Upper \nEgypt during the 1940s. \n\n\n\nArchons Gnostic \nterm for good or evil \nangels, especially as \nworld-creating or world- \ngoverning spirits who \ncontrolled the \nphenomena of the \nstars, heavens, weather, \netc. \n\n\n\nJohnHuss(ca. 1370- \n1415) Bohemian \nreligious reformer, \nfounder of the Hussite \nsect which \nrenounced papal \nindulgences and the \ndoctrine of \ntransubstantiation. \nHuss was promised a \nsafe-conduct to \ndefend his views before \na church council, but \nthe promise was broken; \nhe was declared \nheretic, arrested, and \nburned. \n\n\n\nChristians taught that the west was the natural home of "demons." \nThe Bruce Papyrus depicted Jesus revealing to his disciples the magic \nwords that would make evil Archons "flee away to the West, to the Left \nHand." 32 When the Greek church baptized converts, "they first \nturned their faces to the west, and so renounced the devil, and then to \nthe east, and made their covenant with Christ."" When John Huss \nwas burned for heresy at Constance in 141 5, he was at first bound to th< \nstake facing east; but the error was noticed in time, and he was shifted \nto face west, the direction "fitting for a heretic." 54 \n\nSuperstition still maintains the male-and-female symbolism of east \nand west. The bad luck caused by spilling salt (symbol of blood) can \nbe averted by throwing the salt over the left shoulder, toward the west, \nrelegating the bad luck to the devils. 35 \n\nGypsies believed they could keep a horse from straying by marking \nthe right fore hoof with a male cross, the left fore hoof with a female \nring. 36 The idea was that the sexual symbols would attract one another \nand tangle the horse\'s feet like a hobble. \n\nIt is still customary for rulers to hold the "phallic" scepter in the \nright hand, the "yonic" orb in the left. This usage descended from \nthe king\'s symbolic display of the hieros gamos between himself and \nthe Goddess of his land. The original meaning was that the ruler \nunited male and female principles; but the meaning was lost, and only \nthe symbols remained. \n\nI. Elworthy, 138. 2. O\'Flaherty, 147. 3.

Her work didn\'t survive \nthe book-burnings of the early Christian era. She was one of the first \nclassic authors to be attacked because of her homosexual orientation \nand her devotion to the Goddess. By the 8th century a.d., nothing \nsurvived of her large corpus of poetry except a few fragments quoted \nby other authors. 2 \n\nFemale homosexuality was generally regarded as a virtually \n\n\n\n\n\n\n535 \n\n\n\nLethe unthinkable threat in patriarchal societies. Christian Europe regarded \n\nLeto lesbianism as "a crime without a name," and sometimes burned \n\n^ a ^ B ^ H ^ a ^ HH ^ HI lesbians alive without trial. To this day, female homosexuals are credited \nwith fearful powers; Frank Caprio said "Lesbianism is capable of \ninfluencing the stability of our social structure." 3 Any phallocentric \nsociety would naturally so regard women indifferent to a phallus. \n\n1.

According to Orphics and other \nmystery-cultists, the spring of Lethe under a white cypress was the \nfirst thing to be seen in the underworld by a newly dead soul; and the \nsoul would be made very thirsty, and would be tempted to drink. Part \nof the mystery-cultists\' training was to learn endurance of thirst, for a \ndraught of Lethe would wipe out their memories of their previous \nincarnations and leave them no wiser than the rest of humanity, always \nborn again without remembering previous births. The enlightened \none should seek instead the spring of Memory (Mnemosyne). "Thou \nshalt find to the left of the house of Hades a spring, and by the side \nthereof standing a white cypress. To this spring approach not near. But \nthou shalt find another, from the lake of Memory cold water flowing \nforth, and there are guardians before it." l \n\nThe location of Lethe in the underworld, in classical and Gnostic \nimagery, derived from the ancient oracular cave of the Earth-deities \n(Chthonioi) at Lebadeia, where one made elaborate preparations to go \ndown into the dark pit and learn his fate through "things seen" or \n"things heard." Among the preparations, "he has to drink the water \ncalled Lethe, in order to achieve forgetfulness of all that he has \nhitherto thought of; and on top of it another water, the water of \nMnemosyne, which gives him remembrance of what he sees when \nhe has gone down." 2 \n\nClassical writers made Lethe one of the principal rivers of the \nunderworld, along with Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Styx. 3 \n\n1.

Their divine marriage took place at the Liberalia on \nirch 17, later Christianized as St. Patrick\'s Day, since Patrick or \nicius was a Celtic form of the same god. 1 \nHis Greek form was Dionysus Liber, annually reborn as the \nine Child laid in a winnowing-basket or manger. This ceremony \nadopted into the legend of the infant Christ, called a son of the god \nce worshipped as Liber in Jerusalem. 2 When the Roman temple of \nle Great Mother was converted into the church of Santa Maria \naggiore, the manger ceremony remained an essential part of its \nistmas observances. Usener claimed the church was founded by \nLiberius, possibly a confusion with the name of the pagan god. 3 \nDionysus.) \n\nVotaries of Liber were "libertines." The modern meaning still \n>kes their orgiastic rites. "Liberty" was also derived from their cult \n\nof the Liberalia, when, as part of the festivity, slaves were \niporarily free and permitted to behave as if they were masters. \nHiis practice passed into medieval Carnival customs. \n\n1.

Like the Egyptian \nMaat , she represented the balancing process of karmic law. Her \nfigure-eight glyph of "equilibrium" (now the mathematical symbol of \ninfinity) signified action and reaction under the rule of Fate. 1 \n\nIn astrology, Libra is still "ruled by Venus," because she was \nidentified with the Roman Venus-Aphrodite of the ius naturale \nnatural law, matriarchal justice. 2 The blindfold on today\'s Goddess of \nJustice was unknown in antiquity. She not only held the scales of \nevery man\'s fate; she also had the All-Seeing Eye. See Tanit. \n\n1. Lumusst, 84. 2.

Most pagan thinkers said the bes \ndeath was mystically connected with love. Ovid wrote that he wanted \nto die "in the act of coming to Venus." * Heavenly "bliss" was often \nconfused with orgasm. \n\n1.

Her name was \nessentially the same as Eve\'s title, "Mother of All Living" (Genesis \n3:20). Lif \'s consort was a subordinate male, Lifthrasir, "Desirer-of- \nLife." \' The names indicated a belief that Lif would be the true parent of \nthe new creation, whereas her mate\'s only purpose was to fertilize her, as \nin the oldest known versions of the Adam and Eve myth. \n1. H.R.E. Davidson, G.M.V.A., 234. \n\n\n\nLightning \n\nHeavenly-father gods of most Indo-European religions impregnated \nMother Earth, or the sea-womb, with phallic lightning bolts. India\'s \nDyaus Pitar, "Father Heaven," wielded the lightning in token of his \nunion with the Goddess; he foreshadowed Greece\'s Zeus Pater and \nRome\'s Jupiter, who did the same. Dumuzi, Dionysus, Leviathan, \nand many other versions of the "fiery serpent" including Lucifer and \nSatan figures, were identified with the descending phallus of Heaven, \nwhom Jesus claimed to have seen "fall as lightning" (Luke 10:18). \n\n\n\n538 \n\n\n\nThe lightning god\'s "fall" was not originally a defeat in a celestial Lightning \n\nbattle but rather a descent into the womb of the Abyss to fertilize the \n\nworld. Plutarch said lightning was the impregnator of the Great God- ^^^ mgm ^^^^^^ \n\ndess of the Waters (Maria), and their union was "the cause of vital \nheat." \' \n\nLightning was the cosmic phallus of the Vedic fire god Agni, \nmated to Kali as the Primordial Abyss. She was said to "quench a \nblazing lingam in her yoni." 2 Through ignorance of its sexual meaning, \nChristians inadvertently preserved the same image of Maria-the- \nWaters rendered fertile by male fire from heaven. The baptismal font of \na Christian church was likened to the womb of Mary, as the ancient \ntemples\' water-cauldrons called "seas" or "abysses" were likened to the \nGoddess\'s womb (see Cauldron). At the consecration of a Christian \nfont, the burning paschal candle was quenched in the water like Agni\'s \nlingam, with the words, "May a heavenly offspring, conceived in \nholiness and reborn into a new creation, come forth from the stainless \nwomb of this divine font." Mary was said to be igne sacro inBam- \nmata: fecundated by the sacred fire. 3 \n\nThis universal notion of the male-female connotations of fire and \nwater was based on the Tantric view of the water element as Shakti, \nthe primal liquid power that produced "all fiery elements" i.e., male \ndeities and their symbols, the sun, fire, lightning. 4 The Jewel in the \nLotus, primary Tantric image of maleness enclosed by femaleness, \noften used for the male element the word vajra, meaning jewel, \nphallus, and lightning. 5 \n\nThe same combination of meanings occurred in Latin Gemma \nCerauniae, lightning literally the Jewel of Ceraunus, the lightning \ngod. 6 Sometimes the "jewel" was a phallic scepter like the Tantric dorje, \n"lightning-bolt" or "thunderbolt," also a phallus. The same word \ndescribed a phallic scepter made by Hephaestus, forger of lightning bolts \nfor Father Zeus; it was called doru, a spear. 7 The Indian city of \nDarjeeling was named for the dorje-lingam, "lightning-phallus." 8 \n\nA lightning-phallus or lightning-scepter was the emblem of sover- \neignty for Greek and Roman heavenly fathers and for their \nson-reincarnations also. Dionysus, born of the Earth- or Moon-mother, \nbecame "king of all the gods of the world" when he sat on his father\'s \nthrone and wielded the lightning-scepter. 9 His father Zeus descended \ninto the "bridal chambers" of the Mother Goddesses on the Acropo- \nlis at Thebes in the form of lightning; therefore, these shrines were \ntaboo and were called Places of Coming. 10 The sky-god also "came" \nas lightning to fertilize the maternal rock, Petra Genetrix, that gave birth \nto the Persian savior Mithra. 11 \n\nA descent of lightning marked many miraculous impregnations \nand virgin births throughout mythology, possibly beginning with the \nAssyro-Babylonian Zeus, called Zu the Storm Bird. Zu was a model for \nthe winged lightning-spirits the Bible called seraphim, or fiery flying \nserpents. As a Son of God, Zu coveted the Tablets of the Law, wishing \nto rule the oracles and make himself king of heaven. 12 He was \n\n\n\n539 \n\n\n\nLightning \n\n\n\nSalmoneus of Elis \n\nLegendary sacred king \nbearing the Greek \nversion of the same \nname as \nShalmaneser or \nSolomon. Elis was an \nancient city and state in \nthe northwest corner \nof the Peloponnese; \nnow called Ilia. \n\n\n\npunished for his hubris in the Babylonian myth, but as the Olympian \nZeus he successfully defeated older heaven-gods like Uranus, Cro- \nnus, Prometheus, and Hephaestus, and successfully defended his throne \nagainst other challengers. \n\nKing Salmoneus of Elis dared impersonate Zeus the Lightning, \nseeking to become the beloved of the Goddess Salma (Salome) and \ncontrol the weather. He dragged brazen cauldrons behind his chariot to \nimitate thunder, and threw torches into the air to encourage light- \nning. Zeus destroyed him for his hubris. 13 So the later mythographers \nsaid; in fact the sacred kings everywhere were made to become God, \nor the Son of God, by such magical means before they were sacrificed \nto the same God. \n\nA Dipylon amphora from the bank of the Ilissos shows a king \nwielding the scepter from which issues a lightning bolt. The figure\'s \nerect penis also shoots a bolt of lightning toward the Delta-symbol of the \nGoddess on an altar. 14 This was a typical image of the god-king, from \nnorthern Europe to central Asia where chieftains impersonated the \nlightning god to mate with the divine swan-Valkyrie Kara, a variant of \nKali or Kauri. 15 Among the Celts, the Goddess\'s bird form was Co- \nlombe, the Dove, bride of Lanceor the "Golden Lance," a lightning \ngod who evolved into Lancelot. 16 \n\nA phallic lightning bolt was the original symbol of the Ugaritic sage \nAtyn, Eytan, or Etana, whom the Bible calls Ethan, a king almost as \nwise as Solomon (1 Kings 4:3 1). He tried to ascend to Mother Ishtar in \nheaven and was cast down like a bolt of lightning by the jealous sun \ngod Shamash. His Hebrew name meant either "perpetual stream" or \n"perpetually firm," both hopeful epithets of the phallic god. Ethan, \nor Eytan, was the answer to the riddle in Proverbs 30: "Who hath \nascended up into heaven, and come down?" 17 His totem was the \neagle, symbol of lightning, fire, and the sun. He ascended spread-eagled \non the bird\'s back in the form of a cross, his fingers "upon the \nfeathers of the wings" like the Greeks\' Ganymede and the Hindus\' \nGaruda. 18 \n\nQuarrels over possession of the lightning-phallus underlay many \nstories about god-kings and their rivals. Like God casting down \nLucifer "as lightning," Zeus cast down the older lightning-deity He- \nphaestus because he defended his Great Mother Hera against a \npatriarchal attack. As a god of the conquered matriarchate, Hephaestus \nwas imprisoned in a fire-mountain and set to forging lightning bolts \nfor the new ruler, Zeus. As the archaic Cretan Velchanos, Etruscan \nVulcan, Hephaestus was one of the Amazonian smith gods who \nopposed the Olympian patriarchy. 19 \n\nThe God of Moses copied the ways of other patriarchal deities and \nclaimed the ability to "cast forth lightning" (Psalms 144:6). In a literal \nanthropomorphization this meant he could cast forth the lightning god \nLucifer from heaven. Medieval theologians were never quite sure \nwho threw the lightning bolts God, or his rival Lucifer, who retained \nthe title of Prince of the Power of the Air. \n\n\n\n540 \n\n\n\nGerman bishops said in 1783 that despite allegedly infallible With \n\nprotections such as processions, hymns, and holy relics, the devil\'s \n\nlightning damaged 400 church towers and killed 1 20 bell-ringers within ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n33 years. 20 It was difficult to explain why God so often threw \nlightning at his own churches; or, if the destructive bolts were thrown by \nthe devil, why God didn\'t protect his churches better. Effective \nmeasures had to wait until the arch-infidel Benjamin Franklin invented \nthe lightning rod. Even then, many churchmen refused to use the \nnew invention on the ground that it was one of the devil\'s artifacts. \n\nWith the decline of the devil, the damage inflicted by lightning has \nbeen once more imputed to God. Modern legal documents still \ndescribe lightning-strikes as "acts of God." \n\n1. Knight, S.L., 135. 2. Rawson, E.A., 57. 3. Neumann, CM., 31 1-12. \n\n4. Mahanirvunatmitra, cxviii. 5.

Lilit \n\ni\\dam\'s first wife was a relic of an early rabbinical attempt to assimilate \nhe Sumero-Babylonian Goddess Belit-ili, or Belili, to Jewish myth- \nalogy. To the Canaanites, Lilith was Baalat, the "Divine Lady." On a \nablet from Ur, ca. 2000 B.C., she was addressed as Lillake. 1 \n\nHebraic tradition said Adam married Lilith because he grew tired \naf coupling with beasts, a common custom of Middle-Eastern herds- \nmen, though the Old Testament declared it a sin (Deuteronomy \n27:21). Adam tried to force Lilith to lie beneath him in the "missionary \nDosition" favored by male-dominant societies. Moslems were so insis- \nent on the male-superior sexual position that they said, "Accursed be \nthe man who maketh woman heaven and himself earth." 2 Catholic \nauthorities said any sexual position other than the male-superior one is \nsinful. 3 But Lilith was neither a Moslem nor a Catholic. She sneered at \nAdam\'s sexual crudity, cursed him, and flew away to make her home by \nthe Red Sea. \n\nGod sent angels to fetch Lilith back, but she cursed them too, \nignored God\'s command, and spent her time coupling with "demons" \n(whose lovemaking evidently pleased her better) and giving birth to a \nhundred children every day. So God had to produce Eve as Lilith\'s \nmore docile replacement. \n\nLilith\'s fecundity and sexual preferences show that she was a Great \nMother of settled agricultural tribes, who resisted the invasions of \nnomadic herdsmen, represented by Adam. Early Hebrews disliked the \nGreat Mother who drank the blood of Abel the herdsman, after his \nslaying by the elder god of agriculture and smithcraft, Cain (Genesis \n4:1 1). Lilith\'s Red Sea was another version of Kali Ma\'s Ocean of \n\n\n\n541 \n\n\n\nLily Blood, which gave birth to all things but needed periodic sacrificial \n\nreplenishment. \n\n^mhmm^mmhh^m There may have been a connection between Lilith and the \n\nEtruscan divinity Leinth, who had no face and who waited at the gate \nof the underworld along with Eita and Persipnei (Hades and Persepho- \nne) to receive the souls of the dead. 4 The underworld gate was a \nyoni, and also a lily, which had "no face." Admission into the under- \nworld was often mythologized as a sexual union. The lily or lilu \n(lotus) was the Great Mother\'s flower-yoni, whose title formed Lilith \'s \nname. \n\nThe story of Lilith disappeared from the canonical Bible, but her \ndaughters the lilim haunted men for over a thousand years. Well into \nthe Middle Ages, the Jews were still manufacturing amulets to keep \naway the lilim, who were lustful she-demons given to copulating with \nmen in their dreams, causing nocturnal emissions. 5 Naturally, the lilim \nsquatted on top of their victims in the position favored by ancient \nmatriarchs. \n\nGreeks adopted the lilim and called them Lamiae, Empusae \n(Forcers-In), or Daughters of Hecate. Christians also adopted them \nand called them harlots of hell, or succubae, the female counterparts of \nincubi. Celibate monks tried to fend them off by sleeping with their \nhands crossed over their genitals, clutching a crucifix. It was said that \nevery time a pious Christian had a wet dream, Lilith laughed. Even if \na male child laughed in his sleep, people said Lilith was fondling him. \nTo protect baby boys against her, chalk circles were drawn around \ncradles with the written names of the three angels God sent to fetch \nLilith back to Adam even though these angels had proved incapa- \nble of dealing with her. Some said men and babies should not be left \nalone in a house or Lilith might seize them. 6 \n\nAnother common name for the Daughters of Lilith was Night- \nHag. This term didn\'t imply that they were ugly; on the contrary, \nthey were supposed to be very beautiful. 7 As with their brothers the \nincubi, they were presumed so expert at lovemaking that after an \nexperience with a Night-Hag, a man couldn\'t be satisfied with the love \nof a mortal woman. \n\n1.

Scot, 512. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLily \n\nThe flower of Lilith, Sumero-Babylonian Goddess of creation; the \nlilu or "lotus" of her genital magic. The lily often represented the virgin \naspect of the Triple Goddess, while the rose represented her maternal \naspect. The lily was sacred to Astarte, who was also Lilith; northern \nEuropeans called her Ostara or Eostre, the Goddess of "Easter" \nlilies. 1 \n\nBecause of its pagan associations with virgin motherhood, the lily \n\n\n\n542 \n\n\n\nM \n\n\n\nwas used to symbolize impregnation of the virgin Mary. Some \nauthorities claimed the lily in Gabriel\'s hand filtered God\'s semen which \nentered Mary\'s body through her ear. 2 \n\nMary\'s cult also inherited the lily of the Blessed Virgin Juno, who \nconceived her savior-son Mars with her own magic lily, without any \nmale aid. 3 This myth reflected an early belief in the self-fertilizing \npower of the yoni (vulva), which the lily symbolized and Juno \npersonified. Her name descended from the pre-Roman Uni, a Triple \nGoddess represented by the three-lobed lily or fleur-de-lis, her name \nstemming from the Sanskrit yoni, source of the Uni-verse. \n\nIn 656 a.d., the 10th Council of Toledo officially adopted the holy \nday of Juno\'s miraculous conception of Mars into the Christian \ncanon, renaming it the Festival of the Mother of God, or Lady Day, \ninsisting that it commemorated Mary\'s miraculous conception of \nJesus with the aid of a lily. 4 Christian artists showed the angel Gabriel \nholding out to Mary a scepter surmounted by a fleur-de-lis on a lily \nstalk. A scroll usually issued from Gabriel\'s mouth, with the words Ave \nMaria gratia plena, the seminal "Word," which made Mary "full." \nAphrodite\'s dove, that other yonic symbol, hovered about the scene. 5 \n\nCeltic and Gallo-Roman tribes called the virgin mother Lily Maid. \nHer yonic emblem appeared not only as the French fleur-de-lis but \nalso as the Irish shamrock, which was not originally Irish but a sacred \nsymbol among Indus Valley people some 6000 years before the \nChristian era. Christianized France identified the Lily Maid with the \nvirgin Mary, but she was never completely dissociated from the pagan \nimage of Juno. Among the people, Lady Day was known as Notre \nDame de Mars. 6 \n\nThe Easter lily was the medieval pas-flower, from Latin passus, to \nstep or pass over, cognate oipascha, the Passover. The lily was also \ncalled Pash-flower, Paschal flower, Pasque flower, or Passion flower. \nPagans understood that it represented the spring passion of the god, \nlike Heracles, for union in love-death with the Virgin Queen of \nHeaven, Hera-Hebe, or Juno, or Venus, all of whom claimed the lily. \nWhen Hera\'s milk spurted from her breasts to form the Milky Way, the \ndrops that fell to the ground became lilies. 7 \n\n1.

The lingam-yoni is \nstill the supreme symbol of the vital principle, representing male and \nfemale genitalia in conjunction. 1 Its verbal equivalent is the Jewel in \nthe Lotus. \n\nSometimes the lingam appeared as a phallic pillar in the cella or \njHoly of Holies, the core of the temple which stands for the Goddess \n\n\n\n543 \n\n\n\nLion and is called "womb" (garbha-grha). 2 Shiva bore the name of Sthanu, \n\nLittle Red Riding Hood "Pillar," and was shown emerging from a lingam-pillar with his \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ "jewel" or phallic eye displayed in the center of his forehead, a graphic \nillustration of the transformation of the whole lingam into a man- \nshape. 3 \n\nIt was a Hindu custom to have brides deflowered in the temple by \nShiva\'s carved lingam to make their firstborn children God-begotten \n(see Firstborn). Temple harlots were made "brides of God" by the \nsame ceremony of the lingam, as was also the custom in the ancient \nMiddle East, Greece, and Rome. 4 Besides these man-sized examples \nthere were large pillars, which often became objects of pilgrimage. \nMany miracles were said to have taken place in the vicinity of Shiva\'s \nlingam. 5 \n\n1.

Ishtar, Astarte, and Cybele rode or drove lions. Bast-Hathor \nwas the Sphinx-lioness, symbolizing the Destroyer. Sometimes she \nappeared with two lion heads looking forward and backward, like her \nRoman counterpart Janus-Jana. This was a symbol of Time, with the \nhieroglyph xerefu and akeru, the Lions of Yesterday and Today. 1 \n\nThe Dark Age kingdom of the Britons was named after the \n"Lyonesse," one of its early queens appearing in Arthurian romance \nas the Lady Lyonors. Merlin\'s city was Caerleon, the Lion\'s Place. \nLions were not native to the British isles, therefore the British lion \nwas an imported totem. Lion and serpent stood for ascending and \ndeclining spirits of the sacred year, the former following the latter in \nthe pagan zodiac. 2 \n\nThe British "Lady who ruled lions"may have arrived on Roman \ncoins, which since the Augustan period showed the Great Mother of \nthe Gods (Cybele) enthroned between two lions, wearing the mural \ncrown that became a Saxon emblem of divinity. She was thus \ndescribed in a poem: "The Virgin in her heavenly place rides upon the \nLion; bearer of corn, inventor of law, founder of cities, by whose gift \nit is man\'s good lot to know the gods; therefore she is the Mother of the \nGods, Peace, Virtue, Ceres, the Syrian Goddess, weighing life and \nlaws in her balance." 3 \n\n1.

See Werewolf. \n\n\n\nLogos \n\n\n\nLogos \n\nGreek "Word," a theory of creation that passed from Tantrism \nthrough Neoplatonic philosophy to Christianity. The theory was that a \ndeity could create anything other deities, worlds, creatures by the \npower of magic words: when the name was spoken, the thing material- \nized. The Logos, then, was divine essence concentrated in a Word \nand made manifest, as Jesus was called "the Word made flesh." The \nGospel of John gave him eternal existence: "In the beginning was the \nWord, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1). \n\nJudeo-Christian thinkers defined the Logos in so many ways \nthat it became virtually without meaning, and so was relegated to the \nstatus of a "deep mystery." The Logos was Christ, or the Wisdom of \nYahweh, or an archangel, or Truth, or the high priest, or the Law, or \nthe covenant, or the scriptures, or Moses, or the creative power, or \nthe soul of the world, or the sun, etc. 1 Orphic, Pythagorean, and \nNeoplatonic philosophers who expounded the Logos doctrine were \nnot well understood by their Christian followers, who struggled vainly \nwith the subtle semantics of the pagan philosophers. \n\nThe pagans\' "Word made flesh" was usually Hermes, represent- \ning the Logos spermatikos, seminal Word, proceeding from the \nmouth of Zeus to beget all things through the power of his agent on \nearth. 2 The Corpus Hermeticum praised this Word-bearer: "Holy art \nthou, who by the Word has created all things that exist! Holy art thou, \nof whom all Nature has produced the image!" Justin Martyr\'s \nApologia earnestly tried to assimilate the attributes of Hermes-the-Word \nto Jesus, "on account of his wisdom," claiming that Jesus was exactly \nlike Hermes in being the Son, Messenger, and Word of God. 3 \n\nOne of the reasons for male enthusiasm for the Logos doctrine was \nthat it provided male gods with a method of creating, formerly the \nexclusive prerogative of the birth-giving Goddess. Hermes-the-Logos \nbecame Hermes-the-Creator, exercising the magic feminine powers \nhe derived from living in androgynous union with Mother Aphrodite. \nThe Perfect Word addressed Hermes as not only the Light of the life \nof man but also "the fruitful Womb of All." 4 \n\nSimilarly, Hermes\'s Egyptian counterpart Thoth mastered the \nWords of Power and assumed the attributes of the Goddess Maat, \n"whose Word is Truth," sometimes called his spouse. Priests of Thoth\'s \nholy city, which the Greeks called Hermopolis, said Thoth was the \nuniversal demiurge who spoke the Word of creation, met, and "gave \nbirth" to the first gods. 5 \n\nThe oldest Oriental father-gods "gave birth" by speech, when they \nwere first conceived by men who didn\'t know the real physiology of \n\n\n\nThe Perfect Word \n\nThird-century Greek \ntext of Hermetic \nrevelation-literature, \ndiscovered by \nReitzenstein in the \nMimaut papyrus. \n\nMet, a mother-word \nrelated to Maat, Greek \nmetis, Sanskrit \nmedha, "female \nwisdom." 6 \n\n\n\n545 \n\n\n\nLogos \n\n\n\nAmong the oldest \nMesopotamian texts \nthere are stories of \ndeities representing \n"the Word." In the \nEpic of Gilgamesh, \nEnlil the god of "air" \nor "breath" was also a \nLogos: "The spirit of \nthe Word is Enlil, the \nspirit of the heart of \nAnu (heaven)." Enlil \nembodied "the word \nwhich stilleth the \nheavens above." 9 \n\nThe fifty letters of \nKali\'s Sanskrit alphabet \nwere matrika, \n"mothers." Hindu \nscriptures said: "As \nfrom a mother comes \nbirth, so from \nmatrika, or sound, the \nworld proceeds." 11 \nOm was the \nmantramatrika, \nMother of Mantras; and \nthese divine Words \nspoken by Kali created \nand destroyed \neverything, including all \ngods. 12 \n\n\n\nbegetting. The Sanskrit word for a father-given or Brahma-given soul \nwas atman, "air" or "breath," cognate with the German atmen and \nGreek atmos, "air." A Brahman father still establishes a paternal claim \nto a child by breathing its soul-name three times into its face, \npretending to place the soul in the body. 7 \n\nThe biblical Yahweh also claimed to give life by the power of his \nbreath or "wind," which he used to animate the dry bones of the \ndead: "Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live" \n(Ezekiel 37:5). This incident was probably copied from the Babylo- \nnian Enuma Elish, wherein Marduk established his right to kingship \namong the gods by showing he could destroy and re-create by the \npower of his Word. 8 \n\nThough male gods popularized the idea of the Logos, the ability \nto destroy and re-create by Word-power belonged originally to the \nGoddess, who created languages, alphabets, and the secret mantras \nknown as Words of Power, Egyptian hekau, creations of Hecate \n(Maat). Every manifestation of life was brought into being by the Great \nGoddess Kali with her Word, Om, an invocation of her own \n"pregnant belly." This was the primordial Logos, "the supreme syllable, \nthe mother of all sound." 10 Kali\'s creative voice had its own personifi- \ncation as a Goddess Vac (Voice), engendered in celestial waters, at the \nsummit of the Cosmic Tree. 13 Vac brought forth the god who called \nhimself All-father, as well as everything else in the universe. 14 She \nreappeared in Greek myth as a disembodied voice, the nymph Echo, \nwho brought the flower-god Narcissus to his doom by trapping his soul \nin her water-mirror. In Arabic her Om became Umm, meaning \nmother, matrix, source, principle, or prototype: the Logos of the Sufi. 15 \n\nOm was a familiar sound. Celts called their Moon-mother Omh, \n"She Who Is." Shebans called their Moon-temple at Marib Aum, \nthe Belly of the World. Lydians placed the same Belly of the World in \ntheir own country as an omphalos or navel-stone, hub of the \nuniverse, "made flesh" in their Goddess-queen Omphale. It was not an \nexclusively Lydian custom; every temple in Greece hid an omphalos. \n\nOm was Alpha, the letter of creation, repeated again as the final \nletter of destruction, Omega, which means literally "great Om." Its \nGreek form is a horseshoe, based on the Hindu symbol of the yonic \nGate. When the biblical prophet proclaimed: "I am the Alpha and \nOmega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and \nwhich was, and which is yet to come" (Revelation 1 :8), he used words \ncopied from the temple of the Great Mother at Sais, where they were \nwritten on stone many centuries before the Bible was compiled. 16 \n\nThe Logos idea was virtually identical with the Oriental concept of \nthe Oversoul, which had been an essence of the Great Mother but \nwas re-defined as an essence of the Great Father or of his son, the \nSavior. Origen said, "As our body while consisting of human mem- \nbers is yet held together by one soul, so the universe is to be thought of \nas an immense living being which is held together by one soul, the \n\n\n\n546 \n\n\n\npower of the logos." I7 Christ was only one of many aspirants to the title \nof Logos. Before him, Attis was hailed as the Logos "who holds the \nuniverse together." 18 But before them all was the Great Mother: "The \nsupreme Shakti has the form both of the seed and the sprout of the \nrevealed coming-together of Shiva and Shakti; subtlest of the subtle, She \nb contained in all that lies between the first and the last letters of the \nalphabet, which contains the original root forms from which the names \nof everything in the world are compounded." 19 \n\nThe Christian idea that Christ was God\'s "Word made flesh" was \nan idea common to all the ancient pagan world. Every king was \nliterally God manifested in the flesh, whether he was a real ruler or a \nsacramental surrogate ruler. Usually he was called Savior, and begot- \nten by the god on a temple virgin. He was chosen and invested by holy \nwords and name-souls. Antiochus of Syria, for instance, received the \ndivine surname of Epiphanes, "God Made Manifest (in the flesh)." 20 \n\nNot even Christians, however, managed to purge the Logos of all \nits original feminine connotations. Clement of Alexandria distorted \nhis symbolism to the point of absurdity when trying to connect the \nLogos with parenthood: "The Word is everything to the child, both \nfather and mother, teacher and nurse. . . . The nutriment is the milk of \nthe Father . . . and the Word alone supplies us children with the milk \nof love. . . . For this reason, seeking is called sucking; to those infants \nwho seek the Word, the Father\'s loving breasts supply milk." 21 \n\nThese odd notions arose from the ancient belief that a mother gave \nher child its name-soul along with the first breast milk, as she \nbreathed a Word that would henceforth define and personify the child. \nIn the Old Testament, children were named by their mothers, never \nby their fathers. 22 Thus a universal Parent would be expected to give \nname-souls to all creation along with universal breast milk. \n\nA giver of nourishment was also a giver of Law, derived from the \nsame root word as Logos. Priest-chieftain of the Icelandic Althing \nsupreme governing body of the tribes had a title now translated \nLawspeaker. But that is not the literal translation of the Icelandic \nword, logsogumathr, which really means Mother- Who-Speaks-the- \nWord. 23 \n\nThe doctrine of the Logos was so widespread that Christians could \nhardly be expected to ignore it. It was one of many pagan ideas that \nme church eagerly seized. Medieval Schoolmen tried to make it \nreconcile faith with reason, insisting that the two must be identical \nbecause their root was the same: "that no more than one source of \ntruth, the Logos, had ever existed, and that everything of any value in \nhuman wisdom, especially in Greek philosophy, flowed from that sole \nBource. Plato himself was reputed to have pilfered from Moses." 24 \n\nThe Schoolmen were ignorant of the ancient logoi, sacred writings \npf the Orphics, mentioned by Plato and other philosophers as a vast \nmass of literature amounting to a true "Bible"; these writings had all \nbeen destroyed during the early centuries of Christianity. 25 But there \n\n\n\nLogos \n\n\n\nSchoolmen \n\nPhilosophical and \ntheological thinkers \nof the "Scholastic" \nmovement, 1 1th to \n15 th centuries, \nincluding such \nauthorities as Abelard, \nAquinas, Duns \nScotus, Ockham, and \nAlbertus Magnus. \n\n\n\n547 \n\n\n\nLohengrin \n\nLoki \n\n\n\nGospel of Truth \n\nGnostic scripture \nassociated with the \nearly Christian sect of \nValentinians, \nfounded about 1 50 a.d. \n\n\n\nwere Christian Gnostic writings that had copied the Orphics and \ntransmitted the idea of the Logos to Christian dogma even after they \nwere declared "heresies." The Gospel of Truth said, for example, \n"When the Word appeared, the Word which is in the hearts of those \nwho pronounced It. . . . It was not only a sound, but It had taken on a \nbody as well." 26 Christians gave such assertions a rather simplistic \ninterpretation, assuming the body was Christ\'s; yet perhaps the more \nperceptive of the ancient philosophers meant that man, the verbaliz- \ning animal, in effect creates all his gods out of his Word. \n\nI.

The holy swan, Leda\'s lover, was transformed \ninto a Knight of the Holy Grail, dedicated to helping women maintain \ntheir legal rights under a patriarchal system. See Swan. \n\n\n\nLoki was sometimes \nLogi, "Flame," the fire \ngod identified with \nthe Celtic Lug, and \nprobably descended \nfrom the Aryan Agni- \nShiva as the \nlightning-fire \n"quenched" by his \nmarriage to the \nGoddess of the \nwatery abyss. Indeed, \nunder the name of \nAgni, the god was "an \nearly king of \nSweden" married to the \nGoddess Skialf, or \nSkadi. 7 \n\n\n\nLoki \n\nNorse god of complex character and great age. He may have been a \ngenius loci, "spirit of a place." His name may have descended from \nSanskrit Loka, a spirit of the seven celestial planes. He was an archaic \nform of the "Luck" envisioned as guardian angel of a clan or family, \noften embodied in a fetish object. 1 One story said Loki\'s lips were \nstitched up with a thong, suggesting that his spirit dwelt in a mummified \noracular head. 2 Such heads were also used as clan-spirits by the early \nHebrews, who called them teraphim} To lose them was to lose the \nfamily\'s "luck." \n\nLike many of the oldest gods, Loki was bisexual. He even \nsucceeded in becoming a mother, though only after he had swal- \nlowed a woman\'s heart to acquire the power of birth-giving. The Greek \nZeus resorted to the same feminine magic, for the same reason. \nLoki\'s offspring was the eight-legged horse Sleipnir, spirit of death, a \nsymbol of the gallows tree on which Odin rode. 4 \n\nLoki was also a death spirit in his own right, like Shiva the \nDestroyer who often appeared as Shiva the Destroyed, dead under \nthe feet of Kali the Crone, his guts pulled out of his belly and devoured. \nThe same thing happened to Loki as he was periodically sacrificed to \nSkadi the Crone. 5 Also like the Oriental god, Loki always came back to \n\n\n\n548 \n\n\n\nlife. Though the other Aesir chained him up, as the wolf Fenrir and Longinus, Saint \n\nthe troublemaking Prometheus were chained, yet Loki\'s inevitable Lotus \n\ndestiny was to break free and initiate the ultimate convulsions of the ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nworld\'s doomsday. 6 Aryan belief postulated seven Lokas before the final \nparadise of Shiva and Shakti; thus it might be assumed that Loki \nwould have seven incarnations before the final death of the gods. \n\nl.Avalon.40. 2.

Some of Jesus\'s blood \nfell on his eyes and cured his blindness, whereupon Longinus was \nconverted and spent the rest of his life breaking pagan idols in \nCappadocia. 1 \n\nThis canonization-story made even less sense than most, as Ro- \nman centurions were not blind. Possibly in an original version, now \nlost, Longinus was stricken blind after delivering the spear-thrust; but \nthis would have allowed no time for his conversion. \n\nThe true prototype of the legend seems to have been the blind god \nHod, who slew the Norse savior Balder with the thrust of a spear of \nmistletoe. Early-medieval missionaries deliberately confused Jesus with \nBalder. Some even declared the cross of Jesus\'s crucifixion was made \nof mistletoe. 2 \n\nMarch 1 5, the "Ides of March" when most pagan saviors died, was \nthe day devoted to Hod by the heathen, and later Christianized as the \nfeast day of the Blessed Longinus. 3 \n\n1.

Possibly it was \nonce a shrine of the Water-goddess. Early in the 19th century, a \nGerman writer transformed the Lorelei into the usual maiden disap- \npointed in love. She threw herself in the river, and afterward \nappeared as a spirit of the rock, singing her fatal songs to passing \nboatmen. 1 \n\nl.Encyc. Brit, "Lorelei." \n\n\n\nLotus \n\nAsia\'s primary symbol of the yoni (vulva), often personified as the \nGoddess Padma, "Lotus," also known as Cunti, Lakshmi, or Shakti. \n\n\n\n549 \n\n\n\nLotus The central phrase of Tantrism, Om manipadme hum, meant the \n\nJewel (male) in the Lotus (female), with interlocking connotations: the \n^^^^^^^^^^__ penis in the vagina, the fetus in the womb, the corpse in the earth, \nthe God in the Goddess representing all of these. 1 \n\nThe father-god Brahma claimed to be a universal creator; never- \ntheless, he was styled "Lotus-born," for he arose from the primal \nGoddess\'s yoni. Egypt\'s father-god Ra also claimed to be a creator but \nowed his existence to the Goddess called "great world lotus flower, \nout of which rose the sun for the first time at the creation." 2 \n\nVirtually all Egyptian Goddess-forms were symbolized by the \nlotus. 3 Pharaohs were sexually united with the World Lotus to \nachieve rebirth after death. The funeral hymn of Unas declared that he \n"had union with the goddess Mut, Unas hath drawn unto himself the \nflame of Isis, Unas hath united himself to the lotus." 4 \n\nOne way of uniting oneself to the lotus was the custom of ritual \ncunnilingus, widely practiced throughout the east as communion \nwith the feminine life-principle. 5 This was probably the true meaning of \nthe Land of Lotus-Eaters visited by Odysseus and his crew. The \nsensual Land of Lotus-Eaters was described as a tropical place beyond \nthe southern sea, which could apply to any land from Egypt to India. 6 \n\nAscetic Jain Buddhism tried to eradicate the lotus symbol because \nof its erotic implications. Nevertheless, a few centuries after Buddha\'s \ntime, the most prominent figure on Buddhist monuments was again \nPadma, openly displaying her genital lotus. 7 A similar resurgence of \nerotic imagery overtook ascetic Christianity, when "obscene" figures \nproliferated in cathedrals and churches, for example the Irish sheila- \nna-gig. \n\nMost Oriental mystics held that spiritual knowledge began with \ncarnal knowledge. The lotus was the Goddess\'s gate, and sex was the \nWay through the gate to her inner mysteries. With proper sexual \nexercises, a true sage might achieve the final flowering of revelation \ndescribed as the thousand-petaled lotus of invisible light emanating from \nthe top of the head after ascending the spinal chakras from the pelvis. \n\nWorshippers of Vishnu sometimes painted their god as the source \nof the World Lotus, which grew on a long stem from his navel. But \nsince "the primary reference of the lotus in India has always been the \ngoddess Padma, \'Lotus,\' whose body itself is the universe, the long \nstem from navel to lotus should properly connote an umbilical cord \nthrough which the flow of energy would be running from the \ngoddess to the god, mother to child, not the other way." 8 Some Hindu \ncosmogonies saw the whole world as the lotus flower, with seven \npetals representing the seven divisions of the heavens where the cities \nand palaces of the god were located. 9 \n\nIn the Middle East, the lotus was Hlu, or lily. 10 It was the flower of \nLilith, the Sumero-Babylonian earth mother claimed by the Jews as \nAdam\'s first wife. The three-lobed lily or fleur-de-lis, like the shamrock, \nonce stood for the Triple Goddess\'s three yonis, which is why the lily \n\n\n\n550 \n\n\n\nwas sacred to the triune Queen of Heaven. The Blessed Virgin Juno Lotus Position \n\nconceived her savior-son Mars by the lily, and the same flower was Lucifer \n\nadopted as a conception-charm of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 11 When Isis ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nwas assimilated to the burgeoning legends of the Virgin, her Egyptian \nimages held the phallic cross in one hand, the female lotus seed-vessel in \nthe other, like the Goddess shown on the Isiac Table. 12 \n\n1 .

Canaanites called him Shaher. The Jewish \nShaharit (Morning Service) still commemorates him. 1 Shaher\'s twin \nbrother Shalem, the Evening Star, announced the daily death of the sun \nand spoke to him the Word of Peace (Hebrew shahm, Arabic \nsalaam). 2 Shalem was worshipped along with his brother in Jerusalem, \nwhich means "House of Shalem." Shaher and Shalem were the same \nas the Greeks\' Dioscuri or Heavenly Twins, Castor and Pollux, born of \nLeda\'s World Egg. They were also prominent in Persian sun worship \nas the two torch-bearers, one with his torch ascendant and the other \nwith his torch directed down. 5 \n\nBoth Shaher and Shalem were born of the Great Mother Asherah \nin her world-womb aspect as Helel, "the Pit." 4 Canaanite myth said \nShaher coveted the superior glory of the sun god and tried to usurp his \nthrone, but was defeated and cast down from heaven like a lightning \nbolt. Pagan scriptures of the 7th century B.C. included a dirge for the \nfallen Morning Star: \n\nHow hast thou fallen from heaven, Helel\'s son Shaher! Thou didst say in \nthy heart, I will ascend to heaven, above the circumpolar stars I will \nraise my throne, and I will dwell on the Mount of Council in the back of \nthe north; I will mount on the back of a cloud, I will be like unto \nElyon. s \n\nCenturies later, a Jewish scribe copied this Canaanite scripture into \nthe Bible and pretended it was written by Isaiah: \n\n\n\n551 \n\n\n\nLucifer H ow ar t thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! . . . For \n\nthou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend to heaven, I will exalt my \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the \n\ncongregation, in the sides of the north: J will ascend above the heights \nof the clouds; I will be like the most High. (Isaiah 14:12-14) \n\nThe biblical writer further told Lucifer: "Thou shalt be brought \ndown to hell, to the sides of the pit" (Isaiah 14:1 5). This "pit" was the \nsame as Helel, or Asherah, the god\'s own Mother-bride; and his \ndescent as a lightning-serpent into her Pit represented fertilization of the \nabyss by masculine fire from heaven. In short, the Light-bringer \nchallenged the supreme solar god by seeking the favors of the Mother. \nThis divine rivalry explains the so-called sin of Lucifer, hubris, which \nchurch fathers translated "pride" but its real meaning was "sexual \npassion." 6 \n\nActually, all sacred kings aspired to the same proud position \nLucifer or Shaher coveted: to be the spouse of the Goddess, to stand \nat the hub of the heavens (carried thence on a cloud), to become one \nwith the supreme deity. Egyptian pharaohs made almost identical \nclaims to glory, as shown by Pepi\'s tomb inscription stating that he \n"standeth upon the north of heaven with Ra, he becometh lord of the \nuniverse like unto the king of the gods." 7 He also descended into the \nearth in the guise of the immortal serpent Sata, father of lightning; \nand his Hebrew name Satan merged with the image of Lucifer in \nJesus\'s words: "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven" (Luke \n10:18). \n\nLucifer continued to be linked with both lust and lightning during \nthe Christian era. He became the Prince of the Power of the Air \n(Ephesians 2:2) who threw his lightning bolts at church towers. He \nwielded the trident, in Eastern symbolism a triple lightning-phallus \ndestined to fertilize the Triple Goddess. 8 \n\nAnother ancient source of the Lucifer legend was the Assyro- \nBabylonian lightning god, Zu the Storm Bird, a forerunner of Zeus; \nsometimes he was a seraph or "fiery flying serpent," the lightning bolt \npersonified. Zu was punished for coveting the power-filled Tablets of \nDestiny that Great Mother Tiamat had given her firstborn son, the \nfather of gods. Zu said to himself, "I will take the tablet of destiny of \nthe gods, even I; and I will direct all the oracles of the gods; I will \nestablish a throne, and dispense commands, I will rule over all the \nspirits of Heaven!" 9 \n\nEgypt called the Morning Star god Bennu, the dying-and-reborn \nPhoenix bird known as "Soul of Ra," who died on the World Tree in \norder to renew himself, to "shine on the world." His spirit dwelt in the \nphallic obelisk, called Bennu or the Benben-stone, which stood for \nthe god\'s sexual union with the Mother. Another of his phallic forms \nwas the mighty serpent Ami-Hemf, "Dweller in his Flame," who \nlived on the Mountain of Sunrise and was identified with the morning \nstar. 10 Thus Egypt and Mesopotamia had several versions of light- \n\n\n\n552 \n\n\n\nbringing Lucifer long before scraps of his myth found their way into \nJudeo-Christian writings. \n\nPlato knew the morning-star god as Aster (Star) and also under- \nstood that the same star appeared at evening in a different position \nand so became the evening star (actually the planet Venus). Plato \ntherefore viewed Aster as the dying-and-reborn deity himself: "Aster, \nonce, as Morning-Star, light on the living you shed. Now, dying, as \nEvening-Star, you shine among the dead." u \n\nGnostic Christians maintained that the "light" Lucifer brought \nwas true enlightenment, which he gave humanity against God\'s will, \nas Prometheus stole the fire of heaven to bring civilization to mankind \nagainst the will of Zeus. The Bible\'s story supported the Gnostic \nview. God denied Adam and Eve the fruit of the tree of knowledge, \ndesiring to keep them ignorant; but Lucifer, in the form of the \nserpent, gave them the "light" of wisdom. \n\nThe Persians, too, said their own Great Serpent Ahriman gave \nknowledge to the first couple in the garden of Heden. Ahriman too \nwas the twin brother of the solar God, cast out of heaven for his hubris; \nbut the Magi worshipped the Great Serpent as the source of their \noccult wisdom. 12 He was often thought more influential in terrestrial \naffairs than the Father who cast him down. \n\nSuch Persian precedents influenced Gnostic Christians who re- \ngarded Jehovah as the villain and Lucifer as the hero, savior, and \nfriend of man, revealer of sacred mysteries that the Heavenly Father \njealously withheld. Medieval secret fraternities perpetuated the Gnos- \ntics\' respect for Lucifer and sometimes identified him with Hermes, god \nof revelation. These Gnostic doctrines persisted through the first half \nof the Christian era and well into the second half. 13 Meister Eckhart \nsaid, "Lucifer, the angel, who is in hell, had perfectly pure intellect \nand to this day knows much." H \n\nIn the 14th century a.d. there were Gnostic groups called Lucifer- \nans, who "worship Lucifer and believe him to be the brother of God, \nwrongly cast out of heaven." 15 Luciferans were first heard of in Austria. \nTheir cult soon spread to Brandenburg, Bohemia, Switzerland, and \nSavoy. In 1336 the Inquisition burned fourteen men and women at \nMagdeburg for holding heretical opinions about Lucifer. In 1384, a \npriest at Prenzlau accused his entire congregation of believing that \nLucifer was God or the brother of God. 16 \n\nOne of the "great questions" among medieval Schoolmen was \nhow many angels fell with Lucifer and how many remained in \nheaven under the command of Michael. Some authorities said "most" \nangels fell. Some said "most" remained. Some said a tenth, a ninth, \nor a third of the angelic host fell, because "the dragon with his tail \nplucked down with him the third part of the stars." Furious debate \nraged also between Thomists, Scotists, and followers of Augustine on \nthe "great question" of the battle\'s location and duration. It was said \nto have taken place in the air, in the firmament, or in paradise. It lasted \n\n\n\nLucifer \n\n\n\nMeister Eckhart \nvon Hochheim Popular \nGerman mystical \npreacher of the early \n14th century; minister \nof a Dominican \norder in Saxony.

She bestowed the gifts of light, enlightenment, and \neyesight, especially as the opener of eyes of newborn children. 1 \n\nThe bogus "St. Lucy" bore the same symbols and was advertised \nas a patron of sufferers from eye diseases. Lucy, or Lucia, was one of \nthe most popular of medieval saints, ranking with Agatha, Catherine, \nand Mary Magdalene as a leading ecclesiastical money-maker. \n\nLucy\'s legend was the same "virgin martyr" story told of dozens of \nother mythical female saints. Her devotion to chastity was so great \nthat when a pagan suitor admired her beautiful eyes, she cut them from \ntheir sockets and sent them to him on a platter, asking to be left in \npeace henceforth. This was how Christians interpreted the Goddess\'s \npatera with its offerings. \n\nThe legend went on to say the pagans tried to execute St. Lucy for \nthe alleged crime of keeping her virginity. But when they tried to \ndrag her out of the temple where she had been imprisoned, she stood \nrooted to the floor as heavily as a great statue. She couldn\'t be moved \neven with ropes and pulleys. A fire built on the stone floor around her \nalso failed to destroy her. Finally she was killed by a sword thrust. 2 \n\nDetails of this naive legend show that "St. Lucy" really was a \ncolossal statue of Juno Lucina, whose jeweled eyes were gouged out \nby a Christian vandal; but destroying the statue proved difficult, as it was \ntoo heavy to be moved. In the end, Juno was broken up and removed \nfrom her temple in pieces but superstitious dread inspired the awe that \ncanonized her. The most significant detail in the legend said Lucy \nwas once very rich, but she distributed all her wealth to poor Christians. \nThis wealth evidently consisted of the expensive temple furnishings \nwhich were informally distributed among the looters. Robbing temples \nand smashing their holy statues was one of the major occupations of \npoor Christians in Rome during the 4th and 5th centuries. 3 \n\n\n\n554 \n\n\n\nPeople whom the church called witches apparently remembered Ludus \n\nbt. Lucy as the pagan Goddess Lucina, and continued to worship her Lug \n\nWith pagan ceremonies even though she was concealed by a Christian ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ntloak. As late as 1890, Tuscan witches still used Lucina\'s healing \n[-harm, a wreath of rue tied with red ribbon, making the patient spit \nhree times through the wreath calling on "St. Lucy" for protection \njigainst the evil eye. 4 \n\nOther versions of the same Goddess, such as Triduana (Diana \nrriformis) and the Irish Medana, were also assimilated to Christianity \nis fictitious saints, of whom the same story was told: they were beautiful \n[irgins who gouged out their eyes rather than succumb to the \nemptations of love. 5 It seems the new churches inherited from the ruin \nIf the old pagan world a great many eyeless female statues. \n\nSome medieval sources viewed Lucy as a female Christ and \nIttributed to her the same miracles performed by Jesus. She could \nestore sight to the blind, and by her magic touch she cured her own \npother\'s "issue of blood." 6 \n\nIn Sicily, St. Lucy continued to rule the Festival of Lights on the \nhortest day of the year, recalling the ancient festival of Juno Lucina \n(ekindling the sun. Swedish celebrations of the day still feature a girl \nRearing a crown of candles, known as the Lussibruden (Lucy \nferide). 7 \n\n1. Lxrousse, 203-4. 2. Brewster, 21. 3. J.H.

The ludi evolved into the commedia, carnivals, circuses, and \npystery plays of the Middle Ages, with the old gods disguised as \nlowns, whose traditional hieratic gestures thus became "ludicrous." \nfne ancient rex ludorum, King of the Games, became the medieval \nLarnival King, or Prince of Fools. See Antic Hey. \n\n\n\n"g \n\nltic god, son or reincarnation of the Dagda, eponymous founder of \nle cities of Lyons and London formerly Lugdunum, the stronghold \nf Lug. His temple stood on Ludgate Hill. 1 "Lud\'s Gate" was a great \none called Crom Cruaich, the Bloody Crescent, apparently a symbol \nf the menstruating Moon-goddess to whom Lug was married in \nuggestively Tantric style. 2 \n\nLug\'s special festival was Lammas Eve, formerly Lugnasad, "the \nJames of Lug." The pagan rites of Lugnasad were kept to a very late \nate at Taillten in Ireland, where the Goddess had been worshipped as a \nical Earth-mother, Tailltiu. At the annual Taillten Fair, men bought \n\n\n\nvar.

Irish \nlegendary history called \nhim a King Lugadius \nmartyred by a lance- \nthrust from a druidic \npriest a story taken \nquite directly from \nancient cults of the \nsacred-king/dying- \ngod. Lug perished after \nmarrying the Great \nGoddess called "the \nSovereignty of Erin \nuntil the day of \ndoom." 3 \n\n\n\nbrides in a custom reminiscent of the Goddess\'s ancient rites of sacred \npromiscuity and defloration. The hill where payments were collected \nwas known as the Hill of the Buying. 4 \n\nTaillten was so notorious for promiscuity that any casual sexual \naffair came to be known as a Taillten marriage. 5 Taillten marriages \nwere actually legal up to the 1 3 th century. They were supposed to last \nthe period specified by the old lunar calendars, a year and a day. 6 \n\nLug\'s curious name may have come in some remote past time \nfrom Mesopotamia, where the title of a sacred king, the Goddess\'s \nspouse, was lugal. 7 \n\n1.

Together they represented fire and \nwater, whose combination produced the Blood of Life. Luna the \nwatery moon used to be considered superior to Sol the fiery sun. Even \nChaucer wrote of "Luna the Serene, / Chief goddess of the ocean \nand its queen, / Though Neptune have therein his deity, / Is over him \nand empress of the sea." \' \n\nMany myths present the Moon-goddess as the Creatress who first \ndrifted alone on the primal ocean of chaos until she decided to bring \norderly forms out of elemental formlessness. Thus she was specifically \n"Moon Shining Over the Sea" to Scandinavian pagans. 2 Finns \ncalled her Luonnotar, sometimes loosely translated Daughter of Nature \nBut she was not the daughter of anything; she existed all alone in \nprimordial time, until she tired of loneliness and decided to create a \nworld. 3 See Moon. \n\nChristians claimed the worshippers of Luna were crazy, hence the \nword "lunatic," a person moon-touched or moon-struck. To this day, \nmany people believe lunacy is affected by the moon, being character- \nized by increased psychic disturbance when the moon is full. \n\n1. Chaucer, 435. 2. Briffault 3, 67. 3.

Lupa\'s temple harlots were lupae, sometimes \ncalled Queens (or high priestesses) in outlying towns of the empire. \nLupa\'s greatest festival was the annual Lupercalia, celebrated in the \nGrotto of the She- Wolf, with orgiastic rites to insure the year\'s \nfertility. After participating in the ceremony, naked youths traveled \nthroughout Palatine towns to "purify" them. 1 Perhaps this was why, \n\n\n\n556 \n\n\n\ntfter Lupa\'s festival was adopted by the Christian church, it was Lupus \n\n|enamed the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin. 2 See Dog; Lycaon \n\nWerewolf. ^^^^^^^^^i \n\n1.

The universality of the \nmother-word (not shared by words for "father") indicates either that \nthe human race carried the same word from its earliest source to all parts \nof the earth at a period previous to the discovery of fatherhood; or \nelse that all human beings instinctively say something like "ma" as the \nfirst verbal sound and associate it with the mother\'s breast, conse- \nquently with emotional dependence on a divinity perceived as a \nmilk-giving mother notwithstanding the absurd reference of Moses \nto a "nursing father" carrying the sucking child in his bosom (Numbers \n11:12). \n\nIn the Far East, the maternal blood bond that joined members of \nthe matrilineal clan was mamata, "mine-ness." 4 Its sacred letter Ma, \nin pictographic form as the Spark of Life (bindu or vindu), was said to \nbe "in the Great Yoni." 5 This scripture referred to a mystic essence \nuniting all the souls in a matrilineal kinship group. Ma or mamata \nexpressed the idea that descendants of the same mother shared the \nsame blood and couldn\'t injure one another without injuring them- \nselves; therefore the concept of the maternal clan was a practical \ninstrument of peace. \n\nIn Indo-European root languages, Ma was often defined as "intel- \nligence," the maternal force that bound elements together to create \nforms at the beginning of the world. 6 Ancient Egypt gave this maternal \nforce such names as Ma-Nu, Maa, or Maat, the Great Goddess of \nthe All-Seeing Eye and the spirit of Truth. 7 \n\nThe primitive Iranian Moon-goddess Mah (or Al-Mah, the Moon) \nwas another form of the same deity. Arabs called her Qis-Mah, \n"Fate," which the Turks corrupted into kismet. She gave birth to a \nseries of Messiahs, each one called the Mahdi, one guided or given \nby Mother Mah. Persians made her name a sacred Word, formed of the \nletters Mourdad-Ameretat, "Death-Rebirth." 8 The ideogram MA \nwas said to mean a state of immortality brought about by drinking the \nmilk of the Goddess\'s breast, which brings one back to the original \nMa-Ma. \n\nIn Hebrew the same sacred letters MA made the Mem-Aleph, \ncombining ideographs of "fluid" and "birth." This holy sign was \ncredited with great protective power, and was written on Jewish amulets \ndating from the early 9th century B.C. 9 It could have been copied \nfrom either the Persians or the Egyptians, whose Mother Isis wore an \n"Amulet of Ma," a vase representing her own fountains of nourish- \ning fluid. 10 Or again, as Ma-Nu, the Primal Deep, she was symbolized \nby three cauldrons. 11 Even today the Tantric Goddess as a personifi- \ncation of "fertilizing water" is named Mamaki. 12 \n\nIn Egyptian myth, a reversal of the Ma-Ma of nourishing breasts \nproduced the female Devourer in the underworld: Am-Am, eater of \n\n\n\n560 \n\n\n\nSouls. In the cyclic fashion of the elder religions, the giver was trans- Maat \n\nI Formed into the taker. 13 \n\nMa, the Great Goddess of Comana, was "worshipped by a whole \n\nj:>eople of hierodules in the ravines of the Taurus and along the banks ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nbf the Iris. Like Cybele she was an ancient Anatolian divinity and \njjersonified fertile nature." H She was taken to Rome where she \njTierged with the war goddess Bellona, who personified fighting spirit as \nndomitable as that of a mother defending her young. \n\nToday the divine implications of the syllable Ma are recognized \nbnly in obscure semi-magical cults like voodooism, where a priestess \nbmbodies the Goddess\'s spirit and is known as mamaloiox mambo. ls \nHowever, Ma is still a universal synonym for "mother."

Maat\'s symbol was the feather against \njvhich she weighed each man\'s heart-soul (ab) in her underground Hall \npf Judgment. Thus the Plume of Maat itself became a hieroglyph for \n\n\'truth." 1 \n\nThe same feathers of Truth were worn by other aspects of the \nGoddess, such as Isis, who was the same lawgiving Mother. The gods \nthemselves were constrained to "live by Maat." Her law governed all \n\nhree worlds ruled by her trinity as "Lady of heaven, queen of the \nearth, and mistress of the underworld." 2 \n\nAs the lawgiver of archaic Egypt, Maat was comparable to Babylo- \n\nlian Tiamat who gave the sacred tablets to the first king of gods. \njVIaat\'s laws were notably benevolent, compared to the harsh commands \npf later patriarchal gods, backed up by savage threats like those of \nDeuteronomy 28:1 5-68. An Egyptian was expected to recite the \nFamous Negative Confession in the presence of Maat and Thoth (or \nknubis) to show he had obeyed Maat\'s rules of behavior: \n\n\n\n/ have not been a man of anger. I have done no evil to mankind. I have \nnot inflicted pain. I have made none to weep. I have done violence to \nno man. I have not done harm unto animals. I have not robbed the poor. I \nhave not fouled water. I have not trampled fields. I have not behaved \nwith insolence. I have not judged hastily. I have not stirred up strife. I have \nnot made any man to commit murder for me. I have not insisted that \nexcessive work be done for me daily. I have not borne false witness. I have \nnot stolen land. I have not cheated in measuring the bushel. I have \n\n\n\n561 \n\n\n\nMaat allowed no man to suffer hunger. I have not increased my wealth except \n\nwith such things as are my own possessions. I have not seized \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ wrongfully the property of others. I have not taken milk from the mouths \n\nof babes. * \n\nThose who lived by the laws of Maat took a sacramental drink, \ncomparable to the Hindus\' Soma or its Persian counterpart Haoma, \nwhich conferred ritual purity in the same sense as the Christian \n"washing in the blood of the Lamb." Egyptian scribes of the 3rd \nmillenium B.C. wrote: "My inward parts have been washed in the \nliquor of Maat." Like baptismal water of life, Maat\'s potion brought life- \nafter-death to the peaceful, but death overtook violent persons. 4 \n\nEgyptian moral precepts were of a high order, many of them \nturning up centuries later in the Bible: \n\nTake heed not to rob the poor, and be not cruel to the destitute. . . . If \nthou canst answer the man who attacks thee, do him no injury. Let the \nevildoer alone; he will destroy himself. We must help the sinner, for may \nwe not become like him? . . . Crusts of bread and a loving heart are \nbetter than rich food and contention. . . . Learn to be content with what \nthou hast. Treasure obtained by fraud will not stay with thee; thou hast \nit today, tomorrow it has departed. . . . The approval of man is better than \nriches. s \n\nUnder the feudal disorders of the 12th dynasty, old rules began \nto break down along with the matrilineal clan system that supported \nthem, and educated Egyptians deplored the disruptions of society. A \nHeliopolitan priest wrote: "Maat is cast out, iniquity is in the midst of \nthe council hall. . . . [T]he poor man has no strength to save himself \nfrom him that is stronger than he." 6 Sometimes kinsman murdered \nkinsman, in violation of the clan\'s most sacred rule. One writer \nunfavorably compared his countrymen to the Maat-worshipping tribes \nof Nubia: "The Matoi, who are friendly towards Egypt, say: \'How \ncould there be a man that would slay his brother?\' " 7 \n\nMaat was more than a judge of the dead. She was a stand-in for all \nEgyptian Goddesses, including Hathor, Mut, Isis, Neith, Nekhbet, \netc. The sun god was told: "The goddess Maat embraceth thee both at \nmorn and at eve." As a birth-giver, she was sometimes Metet, the \nMorning Boat of the Sun, translated "becoming strong" and corre- \nsponding to the Greco-Roman mother of dawn, Mater Matuta. 8 She \nwas worshipped in lands other than Egypt. Northern Syria was called by \nthe Hittites, Mat Hatti: that is, Mother of Hatti. 9 Egyptian priests \ndrew the Feather of Maat on their tongues in green dye, to give their \nwords a Logos-like power of Truth so their verbal magic could create \nreality. 10 Similarly in northern Europe the divine bard Bragi had this \npower because of the runes engraved on his tongue by the Goddess \nIdun. \n\nAfrican Pygmies still know Maat by the name she bore in Sumeria \nas "womb" and "underworld": Matu. She was the first woman, and \n\n\n\n562 \n\n\n\nhe mother of God. Like her Egyptian counterpart she was sometimes Mab, Queen \n\nfat-headed." Macha \n\nI. Budge, E.L., 68. 2. Budge, G.E. 1, 418. 3.

This teaching stemmed ultimately from Egypt, \nwhere the Three Wise Men were the three stars in the Belt of Orion, \npointing to Osiris\'s star Sothis (Sirius), which "rose in the east" to \nannounce the coming of the Savior at the season of the Nile flood. \n(See Osiris.) These three Belt stars were still called Magi in the Middle \nAges. 1 \n\nIn Rome early in the Christian era, Magi meant priests of Mithra \n(the original Persian "Messiah"), or astrologers, or miscellaneous \nhealers and miracle-workers; it was a term for magicians in general. \nRoman Christians were hostile to the Magi but were forced to retain \n\n\n\nMagdala \nMagi \n\n\n\n$ \n\n\n\nStar of David (Hexagram) \n\n\n\n565 \n\n\n\nMagic \n\n\n\nthe three Magi of the Gospel story because their presence was empha- \nsized as evidence of Jesus\'s divinity. \n\nl.Jobes,221. \n\n\n\nGiovanni della \nPorta\'s list said ancient \nmagicians were \ncalled magos by \nPersians; sapientes by \nthe Latins; philosophes \nby the Greeks; \nBrachmanes or \ngymnosophistas by \nthe Indians; Chaldaeos \nby the Babylonians \nand Assyrians; Drydas, \nBardos, and \nSemnothesby the \nCelts; sacerdotes by \nthe Egyptians; and \nprophetes by the \nCabalists. History\'s \nleading magicians \nwere Persia\'s Zoroaster, \nRome\'s Numa \nPompilius, Thrace\'s \nZalmoxis, Babylon\'s \nBuddha, and Egypt\'s \nHermes. 3 \n\n\n\nGiovanni della \n\nPorta (1535-1615) \nNeapolitan philosopher \nand author, who \nwrote comedies as well \nas scientific treatises \non magnetism, \nagriculture, optical \nphenomena, \ncryptography, steam \nengines, chemistry, \nastrology, and \ndemonology. He \nfounded the \nAccademia dei Segreti, \nwhich the Inquisition \nlater suppressed. \n\n\n\nMagic \n\nThough the church condemned magic as a devilish art, the Ages of \nFaith were filled with magical beliefs and practices. Magic was legal in \nRoman times; this tolerance continued through the early Middle \nAges, in some areas much longer than that. Sir Walter Raleigh praised \nmagic as a route to "virtues hidden in the center of the center." He \nsaid magic "bringeth to light the inmost virtues, and draweth them out \nof Nature\'s hidden bosom to human use." \' \n\nThe nobility including princes of the church supported court \nmagicians, astrologers, and diviners who helped them conduct their \naffairs. 2 Scholars carefully classified different types of magicians, as if to \ndistinguish the heretical from the acceptable. The "ancients" were \nrespected for their great magical wisdom. \n\nMixtures of tradition and confusion characterized nearly all the \nmanifestations of magic, especially the verbal charms and holy names \npopularly supposed to invoke supernatural powers necessary to the \n"working." A magician must recite defensive charms while enroute \nto the scene of a magical operation, such as: "Zazaii, Zamaii, Puidamon \nmost powerful, Sedon most strong, El, Yod He Vau He (the \ntetragrammaton), Iah, Agla, assist me an unworthy sinner who have \nhad the boldness to pronounce these Holy Names which no man \nshould name and invoke save in very great danger. Therefore have I \nrecourse unto these Most Holy Names, being in great peril both of \nsoul and of body. Pardon me if I have sinned in any manner, for I trust \nin Thy protection alone, especially on this journey." Proceedings \nwere usually opened with an "evocation," often involving a sacrifice to \nbe performed in a specific manner. The Grand Grimoire gives a \nsample: \n\nOn the third day of the moon, the witch or sorcerer will sever the head of \na virgin kid with one stroke, a clean cut. The kid will be garlanded with \nverbena and green ribbon beforehand and the sacrifice must take place far \naway from habitation. A clean, new knife is used; the celebrant must \nbare the right shoulder and keep a willow wood lire brightly aflame. \nSaying: "I offer this creature to three, O great Adonai, Elohim, Ariel \nandjehovas, in the honor and power and the resplendence of The Name, \nwhich is greater than all the spirits. O Great Adonai: agree to accept it \nas agreeable."* \n\nMagic books were full of charms in series, with assurances that if \none charm failed to call up the dread spirits, then surely the next one, \nbearing even more powerful names, would work. Demons who \nstubbornly refused to appear were threatened with eternal torments. \n\n\n\n566 \n\n\n\nI he frustrated magician played God and enchanted recalcitrant \nIpirits into deeper circles of hell. The silliness of the grimoires can only \nje appreciated through their own words; here in a series of invoca- \npns from the Lemegeton or Lesser Key of Solomon: \n\nO mighty and potent prince Samael, who art the ruler and governor of the \nfirst hour of the day by the decree of the Most High God, King of \nGlory; I, the servant of the Most High, do desire and entreat you by three \ngreat and potent names of God, Adonai, Aglaon, Tetragrammaton, \nand by the power and virtue thereof, to assist me in my affairs, and by your \npower and authority to send me, causing to appear before me, all or \nany of the angels whom I shall call by name, the same being resident \nunder your government. I do further entreat and require that they shall \nhelp me in all matters which accord with their office, even as I shall desire, \nand that they shall act for me as for the servant of the Most High. \nAmen. \n\nIf this legalistic contract failed to bind the demons, the magician \npmmonly resorted to threats: \n\nBecause thou art disobedient, and obeyst not my commandments nor the \nprecepts of the Lord thy God, now I, who am the servant of the Most \nHigh and Imperial Lord God of Hosts, Jehovah, having His celestial \npower and permission, for this thine averseness and contempt, thy great \ndisobedience and rebellion, will excommunicate thee, will destroy thy \nname and seal, and bury them in unending oblivion, unless thou \ncomest immediately, visibly and affably, here before this circle, within this \ntriangle, assuming a fair and comely form, without doing harm unto \nmyself or any creature whatsoever, but giving reasonable answer to my \nrequests and performing my desire in all things. \n\nSolemn magicians seem not to have realized the absurdity of \n! [(communicating a demon, who was hardly likely to be distressed by \nbvering relations with the church, since he had presumably severed \nclations with God already. Nevertheless, wizards were supplied with \n:pe following curse for excommunication: \n\nThou art still pernicious and disobedient, willing not to appear and inform \nme upon that which I desire to know; now therefore, in the Name and \nby the power and dignity of the Omnipotent and Immortal Lord God of \nHosts, Jehovah Tetragrammaton, sole Creator of Heaven, Earth, and \nHell, with all contained therein, the marvellous Disposer of all things \nvisible and invisible, I do hereby curse and deprive thee of all thine \noffice, power and place; I bind thee in the depth of the Bottomless Pit, \nthere to remain unto the Day of Judgment, in the Lake of Fire and \nBrimstone, prepared for the rebellious Spirits. May all the Company of \nHeaven curse thee; may the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Light of the \nHosts of heaven, curse thee into lire unquenchable, into torments un- \nspeakable; and even as thy name and seal are bound up in this box, to \nbe choked with sulphureous and stinking substances and to burn in this \nmaterial fire, so, in the name of Jehovah, and by the power and dignity \nof the three names, Tetragrammaton, Anexhexeton, Primematum, may \nall these drive thee, O thou disobedient Spirit N., into the Lake of Fire. \n\n\n\nMagic \n\n\n\nGrand Grimoire \n\nOne of the most \npopular Renaissance \ncollections of spells, \nexorcisms, \ninvocations, and \nmagical recipes. \n\n\n\n567 \n\n\n\nMagic The grimoires provided many excuses for failure. They required \n\ninfinite care in the manufacture of tools, with complicated charms and \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ debilitating purifications, fasting, and penance. Their lists of holy \n\nnames and words of power were lengthy and hard to remember and \nletter-perfect recitation was essential. The practice of magic was \nclearly beyond the grasp of the lazy, stupid, or illiterate. Unfortunately i \nwas also beyond the grasp of the credulous educated as well. \n\nA grimoire called the Little Albert gave an infallible formula for \nmaking a ring of invisibility, but the ring had to be plaited with three \nhairs from the head of a hyena. 6 Hyenas were scarce in Europe, but \neven if one could be found, its head hairs would prove too short to be \nplaited in a ring. Similarly impossible prescriptions appeared in all magi< \nbooks. The more infallible the charm, the more outrageously difficult \nits execution. \n\nFaith in magic was identical with faith in religion. Both depended \non hieratic ceremony and verbal incantation. Both involved prayer to \na superior power even the same power in both cases. Both used the \nname as a vehicle of appeal and coercion. The pious practiced magic \nno less than the impious by way of a thousand informal charms like the \nfollowing, advocated in 1785 to learn winning numbers in the \nFrench national lottery: \n\nLord Jesus Christ, Who hast said, "lam the Way, the Truth, and the \nLife, "for Thou hast cherished truth and hast shown me the secrets of \nThy wisdom whereby again this night the unknown things which are not \nrevealed save to the lowly shall be revealed to me, send me the angels \nUriel, Rubiel, and Barachiel to teach me which numbers I must choose k \nwin, by Him Who will come to judge the quick and the dead and the \ntimes by fire. 7 \n\nPeasant magic was usually crude, without the secret names and \nverbose invocations requiring a written recipe. Illiterate witches simply \nperformed acts of magic, like this rude country charm to cure \nlameness: \n\nTake hog\'s dung and charnell, and put them together and hold them in \nyour left hand, and take in the other hand a knife, and prick the \nmedicine three times, then cast the same into the tire, and take the said \nknife and make three pricks under a table, and let the knife stick there; \nand after that take three leaves of sage, and as many of herb John, and pui \nthem into ale, and drink it last at night and first in the morning. 8 \n\nA witch\'s patient testified that this procedure did indeed give her \n"ease of her lameness." We may laugh, but equally crude magic has \nbeen promulgated for profit in our own time, often by churches \nthemselves. In 1880, one of the leading churches in Philadelphia sold \nblessed candles with the guarantee that the purchaser would be \npreserved for one year from all disorders of the throat. A sermon was \npreached to this effect, and seven examples given of miraculous \ncures. 9 The mass of exploitable believers was still evident a century latei \n\n\n\n568 \n\n\n\n31 \n\n\n\nvVi \n\n\n\nin 1970, when an enterprising seer sold healing cloths by radio Magic \n\n: advertising: "I lay hands on a cloth," he said. "The healing power of \n\nGod which I received four years ago is passed on to the cloth which I ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nisend to you." 10 \n\nChristians practiced magic from the very beginning of the church. \n\nIsaac of Antioch complained in the 5 th century that not only the \n\npeople but clergymen also "carry about the incantations of the magi- \n\nicians; and instead of the holy cross, lo, they carry the books of devils . . . ; \ni b child carries about devils\' names and comes to church." u In other \n\nwords, pagan amulets were credited with as much protective power as \n\njChristian amulets. St. Jerome himself affirmed that a sapphire amulet \na [\'procures favor with princes, pacifies enemies, and obtains freedom \n\nifrom captivity." 12 \n\nChristian authorities said an amulet containing many secret names \nf God was sure to keep the bearer from any evil death. The cake of \nax called Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) was advertised by Pope Urban V \n\nas a sure protection against lightning, fire, and water; also a charm for \n|sasy childbirth and remittance of sins. Various charms were sold by the \n: church to preserve horses\' hoofs from cracks, to prevent disease, to \n\nenhance sexual potency. Girls wishing to grow long hair were told to \n\nhang locks of their hair before an image of St. Urbane. Christians had \n\nmalevolent charms too. It was believed that any man would die within a \n\nyear if the 108th Psalm was "said against" him by a priest. 13 The \n, Mass was credited with potent magical force for both good and evil uses. \n\nMasses were said for healing, for fertility, for magical protection of \nr livestock, houses, boats, etc.; they were also said to kill enemies. From \n\nthe 7th to the 1 5 th century, church literature spoke of priests who \n\ncould cause death by saying the Mass for the Dead against living \n\nfrsons. 14 \nUp to the 17th century it was still written that a dream revealing \n:he whereabouts of any stolen article could be obtained by placing \njnder one\'s pillow a wax tablet with the names of the Magi Jasper, \nMelchisor (sic), and Balthasar. Another kind of magical dream, to see \nthe face of one\'s future mate, could be had by putting a Bible under the \njpillow with a sixpence inserted in the Book of Ruth. 15 Many magic \n:harms invoked the names of apostles: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe devil is tying a knot in my leg! \n\nMark, Luke, and John, unloose it, I beg; \n\nCrosses three we make to ease us: \n\nTwo for the thieves, and one for Christ Jesus! 16 \n\n\n\nPriests often tried to impress simple folk by teaching them magic \n:harms. Ady\'s maid was given a charm to make butter come in the \n:hurn, by an old woman who said her mother had it from "a learned \nChurch man in Queen Maries days, when as church men had more \ncunning, and could teach people many a trick, that our Ministers \nnow a days know not." 17 Typical Christian magic included verbal \n\n\n\n569 \n\n\n\nMagna Dea charms to exorcise, heal, bless, or excommunicate; the wearing of \n\nMagog amulets such as crucifixes, St. Christopher medals, and scraps of the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m scriptural texts; the use of holy water; the invocation of saints; and of \n\ncourse the belief in miracles generally for "magic" and "miracle" \n\nwere but different words for the same idea. \n\n1.

The same title was applied to all Goddesses throughout \nthe Roman empire, which was verging on a concept of female mono- \ntheism when Jewish, Persian, and Christian patriarchy intervened. \n\n\n\nMagnates \n\n"Landowners," medieval noblemen, whose title in the Balkans prob- \nably descended from the Magnetes or Centaurs. Equestrian warriors \nwere the model of every military aristocracy in Europe: Spanish \ncaballeros, French chevaliers, English cavaliers, all meant "riders of \nhorses." \n\n\n\nMagog \n\n"Mother of Gog," biblical name of the Scythian-Amazonian God- \ndess and her land in the north, whence came equestrian warriors greatly \nfeared by the Semites, to judge from the prophets\' lengthy cursings \nand invocations for their defeat (Ezekiel 38). \n\nAuthors of Genesis made Magog a "son" of Japheth (Genesis \n10:2), though Japheth himself was not a Hebraic hero but a borrowed \nform of the titan Iapetus in Greek myth. 1 From this bit of syncretic \nconfusion arose the impression that Magog was a male, and a giant, \nfor a titan\'s offspring would naturally be another titan. \n\nThough tribes of western Asia continued to worship Magog as a \nGoddess, in Europe "Gogmagog" was usually envisioned as a de- \nmonic colossus. "Ma" was merged with the Celtic mac to yield an \ninterpretation of "Gog, son of Gog." Gog and Magog were com- \nmonly used names for any pair of colossal figures, especially figures of \npagan deities. Yet, curiously, "Gog and Magog" appeared in Renais- \nsance magic books as two of the Ineffable Names of God. 2 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 253. 2.

The Mahdi \n[would be born of "the Virgin Paradise" (Pairidaeza), who embodied the \n(spirit of the Moon-goddess on earth. His coming was so eagerly \npvaited that many historical Islamic leaders claimed to personify him. \nAfter Arabia was converted to Islam, it was usually supposed that \nthe Mahdi would be sent by Allah. But he was older than Islam. As \njhis title suggests, he was a Son of the Moon in the most primitive times, \nwhen all Arabia was the territory of the lunar Goddess, one of whose \noldest names was Mah. 1 See Ma. \n\n1 .

She personified the powers of transfor- \nmation and material "appearances," the same powers attributed to \nMaya-Kali, who made the universe by her magic. Greek writers \ncalled Maia one of the Pleiades, but also understood that she was the \nGreat Goddess of Maytime festivals, of the renewal and rebirth of the \ndead. She made her son Hermes the Conductor of Souls in the \nunderworld, just as the Hindu Maya made her masculine counterpart \nYa-Ma into a Conductor of Souls and Lord of Death. 1 \n\n1.

She was also Mamata, spirit of "mine- \nness" or belonging, binding members of the same matrilineal clan \ntogether through the blood of mothers. 1 In Mesopotamia, she was \nMami or Mammitu or Mama, the Creatress who made mankind of clay \nand nourished her creatures with her own magic fluids. 2 \n\n1.

Queen Cleopatra had a mammisi built for \nworship of her own motherhood after the birth of her first child. It was \nstill standing in the 19th century a.d. but has since vanished. See \nCleopatra VII. \n\n\n\n| Mammon \n\nMedieval demon of commercial acquisitiveness, whose name meant \n"riches." In the Middle East, the original meaning of this name was the \nrich outpouring of the Great Goddess\'s inexhaustible breasts (mam- \nmae), which nourished all her children; Babylon named her Mami or \nMammitu (Mother), the biblical Mamre. Some Sumero-Babylonian \nscriptures called her "Mammetun the mother of destinies." \' \n\nJesus\'s precept, "Ye cannot serve God and Mammon" (Luke \n16: 1 3) meant a choice between God and Goddess, in a time when \nI her temples were richer and more magnificent than his. The Gospels \ndemanded that her shrines be destroyed and her wealth taken away, \nin an obviously jealous attack on the "Many-breasted" Goddess "whom \nall Asia and the world worshippeth" (Acts 19:27). Like the Oriental \nGoddess Earth (Artha, "riches"), she stood for material wealth because \nI her temples had a great deal of it and her soil was the ultimate source \nof all. 2 \n\nIt was the habit of demonologists to masculinize even Goddesses \nwhen they were diabolized and consigned to hell. Even Ashtoreth, or \nAstarte, was a male in hell. Much the same thing seems to have \nhappened to Mammetun: she became a "lord" of riches. Weyer \nmade her/him a dignitary of hell and an ambassador from hell to \nI England, probably a reflection of resentment of English \ncommercialism. 3 \n\n1. EpicofGilgamesh, 107. 2. Cavendish.

See Potter. \n\n\n\n573 \n\n\n\nMan \n\n\n\nThe Goddess-or- \nGod Mana-Anna, or \nMannanan, was \nmasculinized as a "son \nof Lir" of Sidh \nFinnaha. Lir however \nwas the same as \nShakespeare\'s King \nLear, who had three \ndaughters but no son. 10 \nThus, Shakespeare\'s \nsource seems to indicate \nthat this child of Lir \nwas originally the Triple \nGoddess, for one of \nthe so-called daughters, \nCordelia, was really \nCreiddylad, another \nname for the Fairy \nQueen. 11 \n\n\n\nMan \n\nIn the original Old Norse, man meant "woman." 1 The word for \n"man" was not man but wer, from the Sanskrit root viras in wer-wulf, \nthe man-wolf. 2 The name Man meant the Moon, creatress of all \ncreatures according to Scandinavian and other tribes throughout Eu- \nrope. Even in imperial Rome, Man or Mana was the mother of all \nmanes or ancestral spirits. The Sanskrit root man meant "moon" and \n"wisdom," both the primary attributes of the Great Goddess. 3 \n\nHeathen skalds composed a class of sacred love songs to the \nfeminine principle of the Moon and her earthly incarnation, woman; \nthese were mansongr, "woman-songs." They were expressly prohibited \nby the Catholic church. 4 \n\nThe Isle of Man was formerly sacred to the Moon-goddess, who \nwas sometimes a mermaid or an androgynous Aphrodite who kept \nmen\'s souls in "pots turned upside down" i.e., grave mounds and \nbeehive tombs. 5 Passage graves in East Jutland were full of upturned \npots, an Iron Age burial custom. 6 The same custom was mentioned in \nSouth America where the Moon carries souls away and places them \nunder upturned pots. 7 Apparently the Isle of Man used to be a sacred \nIsle of the Dead. The name of its deity was variously rendered Man, \nMana, Mana-Anna, or Manannan. \n\nThe island used to have an "enchanted palace" with a crypt or \nchapel of thirteen pillars, the sacred number of the old lunar year. \nEvery visitor was expected to count the pillars. If the counting ceremo- \nny was omitted, the visitor would be imprisoned in the crypt, which \nindicates a burial place sacred to the Moon. The site was later destroyed \nby "salt spilled on the ground," a reference to Christians\' habit of \nleveling pagan shrines and sowing the ground with salt to make it \ninfertile. \n\nThe Moon-goddess appeared in Manx legend as a Fairy Queen \nwho sometimes led the whole male population "into the sea, where \nthey perished." Most probably they perished first and were given to the \nsea-wornb as in the ancient Norse funeral rite. The Fairy Queen \nescaped annihilation by the priests when she took the form of a wren. \nBut pious Manxmen organized wren hunts, a custom followed every \nNew Year\'s Day thereafter, killing scores of the little birds in an effort to \nkill "Jenny Wren," the fairy. Feathers of the slain wrens were said to \npreserve sailors from shipwreck, and no Manx sailor would go to sea \nwithout one. 8 The wren hunts possibly were pre-Christian, with the \nlegend of the Fairy Queen invented for a new rationale. Before the \nmissionaries came, wrens probably were the "soul-birds" sacrificed to \nthe Goddess. Vallancey said the druids considered the wren supreme \namong all birds. "The superstitious respect shown to this bird gave \noffense to our first Christian missionaries, and by their commands he is \nstill hunted and killed by the peasants on Christmas Day, and on the \n\n\n\n574 \n\n\n\nfollowing (St. Stephen\'s Day) he is carried about hung by the leg, in the \nI center of two hoops crossing each other at right angles." 9 \n\nl.Steenstrup, 105. 2.

Mana came back into English via anthropolog- \nical studies in the South Pacific, where the word was described as \nfollows: \n\nMana is the stuff through which magic works . . . proceeding immediately \nfrom the nature of the sacred person or thing, or mediately because a \nghost or spirit has put it into the person or thing. . . . The cult of the relics \nof saints springs from the belief that their bodies, whether living or \ndead, possessed Mana. 3 \n\nMana also ruled the underworld, which the Finns called Man- \nala. 6 The Romans knew her as a very ancient Goddess Mana or Mania, \n| governing the underground land of the long dead: the ancestral spirits \ncalled manes, her children. They dwelt in a pit under the lapis manalis \nin the Forum, emerging to receive their offerings on the annual feast \nI day of the Maniae. 7 On this occasion the Goddess Mania appeared in a \nfright mask, like the terrifying Crone-face of Medusa or Destroying \nKali. 8 \n\nMania was not solely a spirit of death or madness, however, in \n\nclassical times. Her "moon-madness" or "lunacy" was viewed as a \n\nrevelation of the divine, to be received with gratitude. Socrates said, \n\n"The greatest of our blessings come to us through mania. . . . \n\nMadness coming from [the deity] is superior to sanity of human \n\norigin." 9 In other words, Mana-Mania was the Muse. Gnostics said \n\nMana is "the divine spirit in man"; and the Great Mana, or Mana of \n\nI Glory, is "the highest godhead." 10 \n\n1. Briffault 2, 602. 2. Steenstrup, 105. 3.

Mania \n\nMana may be \ncompared to Hindu \nMaya, the Virgin \nGoddess whose name \nwas "power," and \nArabic Manat, the \nVirgin Goddess \nwhose name was "fate" \nand who represented \nthe Triple Moon. 1 In \narchaic Europe, \nMana was the Moon- \nmother who gave \nbirth to the race of \nman that is, of \nwoman, which is what \nman originally \nmeant. 2 \n\nMana or Mania \nbecame a common \nname for the Great \nGoddess as Creatress \nand Queen of \nHeaven (moon), \nbecause it was \nintimately connected \nwith the mysterious \npowers of women, like \nthe moon itself. \nScandinavians called \nthe Goddess\'s sky- \nrealm Manavegr, "the \nMoon\'s Way." 4 \nCelts called it E-Mania, \nor Hy Many, the \nland ruled by the Triple \nGoddess. Sometimes \nit was Emain Macha, \nthe moon-land of \nMother Macha. \nCormac\'s Glossary \n\n\n\n575 \n\n\n\nManasa-Devi \nManicheans \n\n\n\nManasa-Devi \n\nSerpent Goddess of Bengal, identified with the moon, bearing the \nmoon\'s magic name Mana. \n\n\n\nMana . . . \n\nsaid ema meant "blood\' \n(compare the \nSemitic ima, "mother," \nand dam, meaning \nboth "mother" and \n"blood"). Emain, \ntherefore, was the \ncountry of the Great \nMother\'s regenerative \nlunar blood. 5 \n\n\n\nManat \n\nArabic Moon-goddess, ruler of Fate: thus her name is still a synonym \nfor Luck or Fortune. She was venerated in a sacred stone at Kodaid in \npre-Islamic times, and was one of the trinity of Fates worshipped at \nMecca.

Almonds had the power of virgin motherhood, as shown \nby the myth of Nana, who conceived the god Attis with her own \nalmond. 1 The candlestick of the Jews\' tabernacle of the Ark was \ndecorated with almonds for their fertility magic (Exodus 25:33-34). \nChristian art similarly used the mandorla as a frame for figures of God, \nJesus, and saints, because the artists forgot what it formerly meant. \n\nl.Frazer.G.B.,403. \n\n\n\n576 \n\n\n\nManicheans \n\nGnostic Christian sect, a leading rival of the early orthodoxy. \nSt. Augustine was a Manichean for over a decade, before he was \nconverted to orthodoxy and began writing arguments against the \nprecepts of his former teachers. 1 \n\nFounder of the Manichean sect was the third-century Persian \nprophet Manes or Mani, whose legend claimed he was another \nincarnation of Christ. He was born of a holy virgin named Mariham, or \nMar Mariam, "the Lady Mary," whose title was "Mother of the Life \nof the Whole World." 2 He performed the usual feats of every Savior: \npreached, healed the sick, exorcised demons, collected twelve disci \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI pies, and eventually suffered martyrdom. He was crucified and flayed by \n\njthe Persian king, perhaps as a ritual surrogate. 3 \n\nMani\'s central doctrine was puritanical. The material world was \n\nI the work of the devil, who invented sex to entrap ethereal souls in the \n\nprison of flesh: the same view was held by the Essenes. Mani\'s \n\n\'followers abstained from sex, and also from animal food, even eggs, \n\n|believing that all flesh was evil if begotten by copulation. They ate fish, \n\nI pretending that fish do not reproduce sexually but are spontaneously \n\nIjengendered from "living water." Christians\' adoption of the Aphrodi- \n\njtean fish symbol for Christ may have been a Manichean idea. 4 \n\nAccording to Mani, the devil who created this world of gross \n\n[matter was the Jewish Jehovah. He said: "It is the Prince of Darkness \n\nIwho spoke with Moses, the Jews, and their priests. Thus the Christians, \n\nithe Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they \n\nworship this God. For he led them astray in the lusts that he taught \n\npern." 5 Like Jesus, Mani faced this same demon-god on a moun- \n\nfltaintop and resisted his temptation. The demon-god offered Jesus "all \n\nflthe kingdoms of the earth" in return for a single act of worship, \n\nmplying that all the kingdoms of the earth belonged to the devil, who \n\ncould dispose of them as he pleased (Matthew 4:9). Jesus refused the \n\nbffer, and so did Mani. \n\nManicheans naturally aroused the ire of orthodox Christians by \n\nballing their God a devil. Eusebius fairly frothed with indignation at \n\njpese heretics: "Mani presumed to represent the person of Christ; he \n\n(proclaimed himself to be the Comforter, and the Holy Ghost, and \n\nbeing puffed up with this frantic pride, chose, as if he were Christ, \n\ntwelve partners of his new-found doctrine, patching into one heap \n\nfelse and detestable doctrines of old, rotten, and rooted out heresies, the \n\n|*rhich he brought out of Persia." 6 \n\nThis was wishful thinking on Eusebius\'s part. The heresy was not \n\nlooted out. The Manichean idea of the Catholic demon-Jehovah was \n\no recur again and again through the Middle Ages, in sects like the \n\n3athari, Paulicians, Albigensians, Bogomils, and many others. In \n\n/iew of the sufferings of these people at the hands of Catholic Rome, \n\nheir premise seemed not unfounded. One historian said the Mani- \n\n:hean heresy was conquered only by "massacre and violence at first, \n\nind afterward by organized terrorism." 7 So terrible were the persecu- \n\nions that Lea said, "If the blood of the martyrs were really the seed of \n\nChurch, Manicheism would now be the dominant religion of \n\nrope." 8 \n\nl.Reinach,76. 2.

When the Indians \n\n\n\nEusebius Bishop of \nCaesarea, active in the \nArian controversy \nduring the reign of \nConstantine I; a \nvoluminous writer, \napologist, exegete, \nand "corrector" of \nbiblical texts to suit \nthe theology of his sect. \n\n\n\n577 \n\n\n\nMante objected and even fought back, there arose what General Philip \n\nMantra Sheridan called "the vexed Indian question." The general\'s solution to \n\n,^^__^^^^^^ the question was to exterminate the buffalo, on whom the Plains \n\nIndians depended for food, shelter, and clothing. When the great herds \nwere killed and left to rot, many Indian tribes died of famine. This \nwas hailed as a working of Manifest Destiny. 1 \n\nIt was also part of Manifest Destiny that the Indians must be \nconverted to the conquerors\' religion. They didn\'t like that either. In \n1805 a Seneca chief told a missionary: "Brother, we do not wish to \ndestroy your religion, or take it from you; we only want to enjoy our \nown. Brother, we are told that you have been preaching to white people \nin this place . . .; we will wait a little while and see what effect your \npreaching has upon them. If we find it does them good, makes them \nhonest, and less disposed to cheat Indians, we will then consider again \nwhat you have said." 2 \n\n1 . National Geographic, v. 1 5 1 , n. 3, 427. 2.

In patriarchal myth, Mante was a "daugh- \nter" of the Theban sage Teiresias, daughter being the usual \nreplacement for mother, as in the reversed story of Adam and Eve. The \nmyth signified male usurpation of the priestesses\' functions of magic \nand prophecy, at first by transvestism and/or castration to turn men into \npseudo-women; Teiresias was made female and lived for seven years \nas a temple harlot, which gave him his divinatory powers. 1 The Mantes \neventually came to include male priests, then to consist of a wholly \nmale priesthood. Souls of such magical folk were thought to take the \nform of insects between incarnations, hence the "praying mantis." \nThe same Greek root word meant a method of divination, as in \nnecromancy, geomancy, oneiromancy, pyromancy, etc. \n\n1.
