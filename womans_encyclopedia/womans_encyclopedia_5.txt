Like the Muses who gave Greek poets \nthe gift of words, the Mother Goddesses or matrikadevis gave \nSanskrit poets the secret of mantras, by which the gods themselves coul< \nbe controlled. 2 \n\nThe matrikamantra or Mother of Mantras was Kali\'s Word of \nCreation Om, meaning her own "pregnant belly" and perhaps \n\n\n\n578 \n\n\n\nstemming from the grunting exhalation of a woman in childbirth; for Mantra \n\nOm was the word Kali uttered in giving birth to the universe. 3 The \n\nsecond most famous Tantric mantra, Om manipadme hum, Jewel in ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe Lotus, referred to the Lord of the universe contained within the \n\nGoddess. \n\nHindus believed anything could be accomplished if one only knew \nthe correct mantras. Compendia like the Tantrasara gave "prayers, \nMantras and Dharanis to protect against every form of evil, against the \nbad Spirits, wild beasts, natural calamities, human enemies, and so \nforth which were said to be effective, provided that they were applied in \nthe proper disposition and at the right time and in the right manner." \nTo produce the desired effect, "the Mantra must be intoned in the \nproper way, according to both sound (Varna) and rhythm (Svara)." \nTherefore a Mantra loses its efficacy when translated into another \nlanguage. 4 \n\nThe same belief led the Catholic church to retain Latin as its \nliturgical tongue, 1 500 years after Latin ceased to exist in the mouths \nof ordinary folk. Like Brahman priests with their God-controlling \nmantras, church fathers thought the very sound of the words had \nbeen invested with magic power at the see of St. Peter; so translation of \nthe Latin would rob the words of their power to make God act. 5 This \nsuperstition forced Christian laymen to listen, century after century, to \nchurch services of which they couldn\'t understand a single word. \n\nThe idea of the mantra wasn\'t introduced into Rome by Chris- \ntians; it was there already. Pagan Romans believed, as Virgil said, that \nthe right words, rightly spoken, could draw the moon down from the \nsky. A ritual of "drawing down the moon" is still practiced by modern \n"witches." 6 By the power of her words, a Roman priestess could "arrest \nthe flow of rivers and turn back the stars in their courses; she \nsummons the nocturnal spirits; you will see the ground rumble beneath \nher feet; and the ash trees descend from the mountains." 7 \n\nAll liturgies were basically mantras, evolved from the primitive \nI theory that human words could make things happen in the supernat- \nural realm, which in turn influenced the natural one. An example is the \n| idea of praying souls out of Purgatory, where "mantras" alone \nproduce the result even though the result is unverifiable. This also had \nTantric precedents. Tibetan lamas still circumvent their own law \nagainst eating animal flesh by eating it anyway, to the accompaniment \nof a mantra that will assure the eaten animal\'s rebirth in heaven. 8 \nThus the offended creature is placed, by human words, in a blessed \nsituation where he can no longer take offense. Naturally, mantras of \nsuch marvelous power are revealed only with great care, by qualified \ngurus to tested candidates worthy to become Guardians of the \nMysteries. 9 \n\nl.Avalon,493. 2.

Manu\'s ark, loaded with the \nseeds of every plant and a pair of every kind of animal, tied up to the \nSerpent\'s horn and so survived the watery chaos between the destruc- \ntion of one universe and the creation of the next. 1 \n\nManu\'s ark was the cosmic seed-vessel, in pre- Vedic myth the \nwomb of the Goddess, which preserved the spark of life through \ncycles of destruction and renewal. It seems Manu was a masculinized \nform of Ma-Nu or Mother Night, the name she bore in Egypt, as the \nspirit of the primordial abyss that gave birth to the cosmos. Sumerians \nknew her as Nammu, "the primeval ocean, the mother of the gods." 2 \n\nThe archaic notion of Manu as a Creatress also attributed to her \nthe foundation of morality and law; hence the scriptures that Vedic \nsages called the Laws of Manu, frequently rewritten and augmented by \npatriarchal Brahman and Buddhist philosophies. However, Manu \nremained sexually ambiguous, like Egypt\'s Ma-Nu or Nu or Nun, who \nsometimes took the form of a great Fish who gave birth to the gods. 3 \nNu was translated into Hebrew as Noah. Significantly, this name was \nthe "Fish" without the sexually definitive mother-syllable Ma. \n\nVedic sages came to believe in Manu as a kind of Adam, the \nprogenitor of the human race, incestuously begotten by the Brahman \ncreator upon his own daughter a reversal of the archaic myth of the \nprimal creatress who made, then mated with, her Great Serpent. So \nmany different acts, myths, laws, and customs were attributed to the \nauthority of Manu that this personage multiplied into 14 different \nManus, avatars or reincarnations of the same Manu in different ages of \nthe world. 4 This may have been a re-interpretation of the original \nidea of successive universes, with the dark mother-womb bridging the \nperiods of watery chaos between them by preserving the seeds of \nfuture life. \n\n\\.

The name and its variants may be found from India to northern \nEurope. Buddhists translated the name as Fear-of-Death, and com- \nbined it with Kama, Erotic-Desire, to create the demon who tempted \nBuddha to abandon his meditation before he achieved true knowl- \nedge of Nirvana. 1 This "temptation in the wilderness" scene was \nreplayed over and over in subsequent legends of ascetic Saviors, such \nas Mani and Jesus. \n\nThe gypsies, with their traditions rooted in Hinduism, knew Mara \nto be the death goddess who trapped the soul of the Enchanted \n\n\n\n580 \n\n\n\nHuntsman in a mirror, and caused his death a myth that paralleled Mardoll \n\nancient Pelasgian stories of the death of Dionysus. 2 Marduk \n\nThe Slavs said Mara or Mora was a destructive female spirit who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n"drank the blood of men" by night. 3 She became the mare or Night- \nmare, "A monstrous hag squatting upon the breast mute, motionless \nand malignant; an incarnation of the evil spirit whose intolerable \nweight crushes the breath out of the body." 4 This was the same image \nassumed by black Kali the Destroyer, whose death aspect meant \n"passive weight and darkness." 5 \n\nSemitic peoples associated Mara or Marah with the "passive \nweight and darkness" of the deep sea-womb; thus the name was \nsometimes translated "briny" or "bitter." Marah was the name assumed \nby the matriarch Naomi (Ruth 1 :20) as she passed into the Crone \nstage of her life. An old shrine of the goddess Mara was the Old \nTestament\'s Maralah, "a place of trembling" (Joshua 19:1 1), possibly \na necropolis. The biblical death-curse Maranatha (1 Corinthians 16:22) \nalso invoked the destroying Goddess. Mari was another version of \nher name, as in Kel-Mari (Kali the Pot Goddess, who made mankind \nout of clay), Marici the Goddess "clothed with the sun," Yamamari, \na combination of Mari with Yama or "Death," and Mari-Amma the \nDeath-giver, in Hebrew Mariamne, Miriam, or Mary. \n\n1.

Marduk also killed the first- \nborn God, Kingu, and created the first man from Kingu\'s blood a \nmyth remembered by the Arabs, who said Allah made man from \nflowing blood. 1 Marduk also inherited the tablets of sacred law that the \nMother Goddess had given her elder, favorite son. These same \ntablets were entrusted to Babylonian kings by presentation on the holy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n581 \n\n\n\nMarea "mountain" of the ziggurat.

Mari was the same Goddess later wor- \nshipped in Israel as a consort of Yahweh. 1 \n1. Graves, W.G, 439. \n\n\n\nMare Nostrum \n\n"Our sea," or "Our mother"; Roman title of the Mediterranean, or \n"Middle-of-the-Earth Sea." All seas were maria, "Marys," symbolized \nby the Goddess in her blue robe, sometimes a mer-maid (literally, \nSea- Virgin), often named Aphrodite Marina. See Mary. \n\n\n\nMargaret, Saint \n\nMythical "virgin martyr" who never existed as a Christian but was a \ncanonized form of Aphrodite Marina, Pelagia, or Margarita, called Pearl \nof the Sea. 1 Originally she was a yonic Goddess representing Aphro- \ndite\'s "Pearly Gate," which, like the Jade Gate of the Chinese Great \nMother, meant the genital entrance to paradise. The name Margaret \nmay be traced to Sanskrit Marga, "the Gate" or "the Way," i.e., the \nyonic gate of Kali-Shakti leading through ritual sexuality to the \nparadise of Tantric sages. 2 \n\nHagiographers invented several legends of Margaret-Pelagia-Mari- \nna, all names of the pagan Sea-goddess. Sometimes she was a virgin \nwho suddenly turned Christian on her wedding day and so renounced \nher bridegroom, the "sinful riotings" of the wedding feast, and the \njoys of married life which she decided were worthless as "dung." \nSometimes she was a divine harlot, the wealthiest and most beautiful \nwoman in Antioch, covered with gold, silver, and gems, who suddenly \nturned Christian and gave away all her possessions to poor folk \n(Christians, of course), and allowed a bishop to impose on her a hard life \nof penance. 3 This legend was a favorite of early saint-makers, who \nparticularly resented promiscuous women and invariably coveted their \nill-gotten gains. \n\nOne legend made St. Margaret the daughter of a pagan priest. She \nspurned her rich suitor, Olybrius, governor of Antioch, and devoted \nherself to Christian virginity. She was subjected to amazing tortures to = \n\n\n\n582 \n\n\n\novercome her determination. "All her bones were laid bare, and the Margawse \n\nblood poured forth from her body as from a pure spring." 4 But she still \n\nhad strength enough to conquer the devil, who took the form of a ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ngreat dragon and swallowed her, whereupon she caused his body to \n\nburst and stepped forth "unharmed" except of course for the harm \n\nthat had already been done by her various tortures. After this she was \n\nburned, drowned, and beheaded: St. Margaret was very hard to kill. \n\nAnother legend of St. Margaret said she fled from her suitor to \nbecome a holy hermit. She joined a monastery of ascetics, disguising \nherself as a monk, "Brother Pelagius." In this connection one might \nrecall the rule of early Syrian churches, that no women would be \npermitted to become Christians unless they "made themselves male." 5 \nMargaret made herself male so successfully that she was accused of \nseducing a nun, subjected to severe penances which she accepted \nhumbly, and finally vindicated only after death, when those who \ncame to prepare her body for burial discovered that she had been a \nwoman. \n\nUnder her other name of Pelagia, before she became the monk \nPelagius, Margaret devoted her early life to "lewd" worship of \nAphrodite as a temple harlot. On being converted to Christianity, she \ncalled herself "a sea of wickedness overflowing with the waves of sin \n... an abyss of perdition ... a quagmire and pitfall of souls." 6 The feast \nday of this Margaret- Pelagia was the same as that of St. Thais, \nanother mythical version of the same courtesan-turned-Christian, the \nsecond most popular type of female saint, after the "virgin martyr." \n\nSince Margaret was fundamentally an incarnation of Aphrodite, \nspouse of Adonis "the Lord" at Bethlehem, it would be expected that \nshe remain the spouse of "the Lord"; and accordingly her worshippers \nsaid, "Blessed art thou O Margaret the spouse of Christ." 7 \n\nThrough all her appearances as virgin, harlot, monk, and so on, \nhowever, Margaret remained what the pagan Goddess always was: \nthe primary patron of childbearing women. \n\nl.Attwater,228. 2.

Margawse \nwas the same as the Latin Anna, the Mother of the Year: she gave \nbirth to the four Aeons, named Gareth, Gaheris, Agravine, and Ga- \nwain. She also mated with her brother Arthur and brought forth \n[Arthur\'s nemesis, sister-son, son, tanist, and supplanter: Mordred, \nwhom Arthur tried to kill in his infancy. As Fate or perhaps \n[Margawse herself decreed, Mordred lived to grow up and destroy \n[Arthur. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n583 \n\n\n\nMan \n\n\n\nMari \n\n\n\nMany place names \nevolved from Marian \nshrines. Among \nthem were Amari or \nAy-Mari, the \nCyprian home of \nAphrodite Marina; \nMarib, City of the \nMoon, seat of the \nqueens of Sheba; Marea \nin western Egypt; \nMaronea near Lake \nIsmaris; Maru, \nmother-city of the \nMedes; Sa-Maria, a \ncountry whose name \nmeant literally "holy \nblood of Mary." 2 One \nof the entrances to \nher underworld womb, \na sacred cave \naccessible only by sea, \nwas Mar-Mari, \n"Mother Sea." 3 \n\nSometimes the deity \nwas named simply Mer, \nan Egyptian word for \nboth "waters" and \n"mother-love." 6 \nMer was also a \ncomponent of the \nnames of Egyptian \nqueens in the first \ndynasty. One of Egypt\'s \noldest names was Ta- \nMera, Land of the \nWaters, which could \nalso be interpreted as a \nLand of the Great \nMothers. 7 \n\nNorthern Europe \nknew the same Goddess \nas Maerin, wedded \nto Thor at her shrine in \nTrondheim. H To \nthe Saxons she was \nWudu-Maer: \n\n\n\nBasic name of the Goddess known to the Chaldeans as Marratu, to \nthe Jews as Marah, to the Persians as Mariham, to the Christians as \nMary: as well as Marian, Miriam, Mariamne, Myrrhine, Myrtea, \nMyrrha, Maria, and Marina. Her blue robe and pearl necklace were \nclassic symbols of the sea, edged with pearly foam. 1 \n\nThe Goddess\'s Amorite city of Mari was one of the wonders of the \nancient world. Its six-acre temple-palace astonished archeologists who \nuncovered it in the 1930s. Mari dominated the area now known as the \nHoly Land until it fell to the armies of Hammurabi in 1700 b.c. 4 \n\nSemites worshipped an androgynous combination of Goddess and \nGod called Mari-El (Mary-God), corresponding to the Egyptian \nMeri-Ra which combined the feminine principle of water with the \nmasculine principle of the sun. 5 \n\nThe Syrian version of Mari or Meri was worshipped in combina- \ntion with her serpent-consort Yamm, derived from Yama, the Hindu \nLord of Death. Yamm alternated with Baal, "the Lord," as the \nGoddess\'s favorite and a sovereign over heaven and the abyss. Indian \nYama was one of the consorts of Kel-Mari, as Kali was called in the \nsouth. 8 Tantric Buddhists still speak of the "Slayer of the Death \nKing," Yama-Mari, who was identified with the Dalai Lama. 9 Jews and \nearly Christians used the same combination of names, Mari- Yamm or \nMariam, for the mother of Jesus. 10 \n\nThe spirit of the archaic Mari entered into Babylonian diviners \nknown as mare baruti, sea-mothers, who operated in the bit mummu \nor womb-chamber, where statues of the gods were said to be "born" \n(made animate). 11 In similar womb-chambers the Hindu goddess was \nworshipped as Kau-Mari or Kel-Mari. 12 She is still invoked as Marici- \nTara, the Diamond Sow on the Lotus Throne, "Glorious One, the \nsun of happiness." She is the Goddess "whose mayik vesture is the \nsun," forerunner of the Gospels\' "woman clothed with the sun" \n(Revelation 12:1), who was identified with the virgin Mary. 13 \n\nShe was also the Great Fish who gave birth to the gods, later the \nMermaid, Mare-mynd, mareminde, marraminde, maraeman, or \nmereminne. 20 \n\nIn short, she was always Mother Sea. Her Latin name was Maria, \n"the Seas." St. Peter Chrysologus called her Christian incarnation, \nthe virgin Mary, "the gathering together of the waters." 21 But she was \nalso the earth and heavens, since her earliest form was a trinity. She \nwas worshipped in pre- Roman Latium as Marica, mother of the first \nking Latinus, who was also her priapic goat-footed consort Faunus. \nShe was probably the same Goddess worshipped by the Slavs under the \nname of Marzanna (Mari-Anna), who "fostered the growth of \nfruits." 22 \n\nMari and her pagan consort were incongruously canonized as a \npair of Christian saints, Addai and Mari (Adonis and Aphrodite- \nMari). Their legends called them "bishops" dispatched to Aphrodite\'s \n\n\n\n584 \n\n\n\ncult center at Edessa, probably because their portraits appeared there, \nand it was easier to Christianize them than to destroy them. \n\nTheir cult began with Nestorian Christians who called them "Holy \nApostles Addai and Mari." 23 Another Christianization was St. \nMaura, from the Goddess\'s Fate-name Moera, "older than Time." 24 \nAs the Fate-spinner who held men\'s destinies in her hand, she \ngenerated a taboo: on St. Maura\'a day, women were forbidden to spin \nor sew. 25 \n\nMedieval Spain knew the Goddess Mari as a "Lady" or "Mistress" \nwho lived in a magic cave and rode through the night sky as a ball of \nfire. 26 This may have meant the red harvest moon, or possibly the moon \nin eclipse always a dire omen. The Goddess Mari was said to give \ngifts of fairy gold and precious stones, which might turn into worthless \nlumps of coal by the light of day. 27 In later centuries, the same \nworthless gifts were given to "bad" children by St. Nicholas at \nChristmas. \n\nThe island of Inis Maree had a ruined temple, sacred to a certain \n"St. Mourie" none other than the Goddess Mari for whom the \nisland was named. In 1678 the Presbytery of Dingwall "disciplined" \nsome people who sacrified bulls to the divinity of Loch Maree on the \n25th of August, a day dedicated to Aphrodite-Mari for more than 1 500 \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nyears. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Because the Goddess\'s pa- \ntronage was constantly invoked in every aspect of marriage, Christian \nfathers were opposed to the institution. Origen declared, "Matrimony is \nimpure and unholy, a means of sexual passion." St. Jerome said the \nprimary purpose of a man of God was to "cut down with an ax of \nVirginity the wood of Marriage." l St. Ambrose said marriage was a \ncrime against God, because it changed the state of virginity that God \ngave every man and woman at birth. 2 Marriage was prostitution of \n\ne members of Christ, and "married people ought to blush at the state \nwhich they are living." Tertullian said marriage was a moral crime, \n\nmore dreadful than any punishment or any death." It was spurcitiae, \n\nobscenity," or "filth." 5 \n\nSt. Augustine flatly stated that marriage is a sin. Tatian said \n\n\n\nliterally, a Wood-Mary, \nor Goddess of the \nGrove. To the Celts she \nwas Maid Marian, \nbeloved by Robin, the \nwitches\' Horned \nGod. Their greenwood \ncult caused church \nauthorities considerable \ntrouble in the 14th \ncentury. 15 \n\nMari was the same \nMerian or Merjan \nworshipped in Persia as \nQueen of the Peris \n(Fairies). 16 Iran had its \nmother goddess \nMariana from very \nancient times. 17 She \nmight be traced to the \nland of Akkad, \ncreated by a Goddess \ncalled the Lady \nMarri, Mother of the \nWorld. 18 A king of \nMari in 2500 B.C., \nunited with the \nGoddess, took the royal \nname of Lamki- \nMari. 19 \n\nSt. Peter \n\nChrysologus (Peter \nGolden-word) Fifth- \ncentury bishop of \nRavenna, friend of \nPope Leo the Great. \nThree centuries after \nhis death, a collection of \n1 76 sermons was \nproduced, and \nattributed to him, \nthough mostly spurious. \nHe was made a \ndoctor of the church in \n1729. \n\n\n\n585 \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, ex- \nerting a powerful \ninfluence on the early \nGreek church. At \nfirst he was accounted a \nsaint, but three cen- \nturies after his death he \nwas declared a here- \ntic because of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens \nTertullianus) \ninfluential early \nChristian writer and \nfather of the church, ca. \n1 5 5-220 a.d., born in \nCarthage of pagan \nparents. \n\n\n\nmarriage is corruption, "a polluted and foul way of life." Influenced \nby him, Syrian churches ruled that no person could become Christian \nexcept celibate men, and no man who had ever been married could \nbe baptized. Saturninus said God made only two kinds of people, good \nmen and evil women. Marriage perpetuated the deviltry of women, \nwho dominated men through the magic of sex. 4 Centuries later, St. Ber- \nnard still proclaimed that it was easier for a man to bring the dead \nback to life than to live with a woman without endangering his soul. 5 \n\nSt. Paul damned marriage with faint praise, remarking that to \nmarry was only better than to burn (1 Corinthians 7:9); but later \nfollowers of Pauline Christianity damned marriage altogether, according \nto the word of Jesus: "If any man come to me, and hate not his \nfather, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, \nyea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:26). \nJesus renounced his family, declaring that he had no relatives except the \nfaithful (Mark 3:31-35). Jerome interpreted this as a mandate to \ndestroy marriage and the family. He was disgusted by motherhood: "the \ntumefaction of the uterus, the care of yelling infants, all those fond \nfeelings which death at last cuts short." 6 He said every man who loves \nhis wife passionately was guilty of adultery. 7 Augustine also expressed \ndisgust at feminine sexual and maternal functions. He coined the saying \nthat birth is demonstrably accursed because every child emerges \n"between feces and urine." 8 \n\nAn example of anti-family virtue was made of one of the artificial \nsaints built on a title of the pro-family Goddess, Perpetua, "the \nEternal One." In her new Christian disguise as St. Perpetua, she was so \ndevoted to single blessedness that she not only faced martyrdom with \nequanimity but also renounced her parents, her husband, and her \nsuckling infant in order to become Christian. Her pagan relatives \ntried to soften her heart by putting the infant to her breast, but she threw \nit aside and said to them, "Begone from me, enemies of God, for I \nknow you not!" 9 \n\nThis was the early Christian notion of a "good" woman: one who \nplaced faith before family. Church customs reflected this view. There \nwas no Christian sacrament of marriage until the 16th century. 10 \nCatholic scholars say the wedding ceremony was "imposed on" a \nreluctant church, and "nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness \nwith which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were \nevolved." It is perhaps not remarkable to find that these liturgical forms \nwere not evolved by the church at all, but borrowed from pagans\' \ncommon law. 11 \n\nThe Anglican marriage service came from Anglo-Saxon deeds \nused to transfer a woman\'s land to the stewardship of her "house- \nman" (husband). The original wording had the bridegroom say: "With \nthis ring I thee wed and this gold and silver I give thee and with my \nbody I thee worship, and with all my worldly chattels I thee honor." \nThe bride responded: "I take thee to my wedded husband, to have \n\n\n\n586 \n\n\n\nbnd to hold, for fairer for fouler, for better for worse, for richer for Marriage \n\npoorer, in sickness and in health, to be bonny and buxom in bed and \n\njat board, till death us depart [sic]." A curious clerical note made in the ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmargin at a later date, explained that "bonny and buxom" really \n\nmeant "meek and obedient." 12 \n\nAbout wedding ceremonies in Greece and the Balkans, an author- \nity on Greek religion wrote: "With the modern Greeks as with other \nEuropeans, the religious service of their church is intrusive, no real part \npf the ceremony of marriage, but an elaborate way of calling down a \nplessing on the ceremonial, or what is left of it, which constitutes the \nreal wedding." 13 \n\nThe Christian priesthood was fighting ancient traditions in which it \nwas remembered that male spiritual authority was dependent on \nmarriage: either a hieros gamos between the ruler of a land and his \nGoddess, or the mandatory husbandship of priests who were not \nallowed to contact the deities unless they had wives. In Asia, the gods \nthemselves had to be married. Even patriarchal figures like Vishnu \nand Brahma needed their Shaktis or wives who embodied their power, \nand "without whom they avail nothing." H Brahman priests couldn\'t \nperform certain ceremonies without wives. 15 Oriental mystics taught \nthat any man was spiritually incomplete until he experienced bha- \n\n\n\nvanan, "husbandship," which linked him to the Goddess as Bhavani or \nI Existence." 16 The implication was that an unmarried man does not \ntruly exist. Tantric hymns said all women are goddesses because they \nembody the spirit of the Goddess; thus "women are Life itself." 17 \n\nEarly Israelites also barred unmarried men from the priesthood. \nThey thought a priest\'s spells and invocations would be powerless if \nhe had no wife. 18 Jewish scriptures said, "The man who has neither wife \nnor children is disgraced in the world and is hated by them, like a \nleafless and fruitless tree." 19 Similarly, the spiritual authority of Rome\'s \n[ligh priest the Flamen Dialis depended on his marriage to the \nplaminica, high priestess of Juno. If she died or left him, he immediately \njost his holy office. 20 \n\nSo much depended on a man\'s ability to remain married, in the \n:t ancient times, that the first rules of marriage invented by men \nm to have been rules for insuring permanent monogamy. Thus a \niband could hold on to a woman\'s property and children by \nding the woman herself. Matriarchal societies seldom permitted \nual jealousy. Women were free to change lovers or husbands, to \nake polyandrous or group marriages. Myths record the transition from \noose, flexible marital arrangements favored by Goddesses to the rigid \nnonogamy favored by Gods. \n\nThe pre-Hellenic Mother of God, Rhea, condemned monogamy \nis a sin and insisted on her ancient law of group marriage. Her son \neus defied her, on behalf of patriarchal invaders of her lands. He \nreed Rhea\'s "daughter" Hera actually another form of Rhea \nerself into a monogamous union, though he never stuck to his own \n\n\n\no \n\n\n\n587 \n\n\n\nMarriage side of the bargain. He was constantly adulterous, and Hera detested \n\nhim. On one occasion she roused the other gods in a rebellion against \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ him. Zeus punished her by hanging her from the sky with anvils \n\nattached to her ankles perhaps the first divine precedent permitting \nmen to torture wives into submission. 21 \n\nHellenic Greeks believed that men should seize every possible \nadvantage in forcing wives to be obedient and (especially) faithful. \nAristotle taught that a husband should be more than twice his bride\'s \nage he 37, she 18 so he could dominate her: "The elder and full \ngrown is superior to the younger and more immature." 22 Greek \npatriarchy foreshadowed the patriarchal religion which, "in the form \nseen in Judaism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism, is basically noth- \ning other than a formalization, by means of a projection upon deities, \nand the demand for obedience to their revealed command, of the \nfather\'s desired sexual control of his wives and of their female \nchildren, and the forcible exclusion of male children from sexual \nactivity." 23 \n\nThe Greeks\' contempt for wives eventually led to their cult of \nhomosexual romance, ignoring their families and taking young boys \nfor true-love relationships. Some scholars say this belittling of marriage \nwas founded on fear of women: \n\nThe Greek male\'s contempt for women was not only compatible with, but \nalso indissolubly bound to, an intense fear of them, and to an underly- \ning suspicion of male inferiority. Why else would such extreme measures \nbe necessary? Customs such as the rule that a woman should not be \nolder than her husband, or of higher social status, or more educated, or \npaid the same as a male for the same work, or be in a position of \nauthority betray an assumption that males are incapable of competing \nwith females on an equal basis; the cards must first be stacked, the \nfemale given a handicap. 24 \n\nObserving group marriages among their neighbors, the Greeks \nregarded such customs as barbaric or unusual. In an age when the \nGreeks were almost the only people with a patriarchal-monogamous \nsocial structure, a Greek said to the Spartan wife of Leonidas: "You of \nLacedaemon are the only women in the world that rule the men." \nShe retorted: "We are the only women who bring forth men." 25 \n\nDespite their pretense that their own system was the only normal \none, Greek writers like Herodotus knew the Arabs were polyandrous, \nthe Scythians shared spouses and children communally, the Lycians \nrecognized only matrilineal inheritance, and the Agathyrsi "cohabit \nin common with the women, in order that they should all be blood kin \nand that their family relationships should prevent them from harbor- \ning envy and hostility toward one another." 26 \n\nCaesar said group marriage was the rule in Britain. An indicator of \nthe group-marriage system among the Celts was the multiple paterni- \nty of many of their mythic heroes. Clothru, queen of Connaught, \nmarried three brothers at once, the same kind of fraternal polyandry \n\n\n\n588 \n\n\n\nI practiced by such eastern peoples as the Todas and the Singhalese. 27 Marriage \n\nThe Nairs practiced group marriage up to the 19th century. Hindu \n\nliterature speaks of a princess who married five brothers at once, and was ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nblessed by the Goddess Cunti, and promised many children. 28 In the \nI Mahabharata, a speech to the same Goddess Cunti told of "the practice \nof old indicated by illustrious Rishis fully acquainted with every rule \nof morality": \n\nWomen were not formerly immured in houses and dependent on hus- \nbands and relatives. They used to go about freely, enjoying themselves \nas best they pleased. . . . They did not then adhere to their husbands \nfaithfully; and yet . . . they were not regarded as sinful, for that was the \nsanctioned usage of the times. . . . Indeed, that usage, so lenient to \nwomen, hath the sanction of antiquity. The present practice, however, \nof women being confined to one husband for life hath been established \nbut lately. 29 \n\nAfter Brahmanism established monogamy in some parts of \nIndia, the rules of marriage were greatly changed: "No act is to be done \naccording to her own will by a young girl, a young woman, though \nshe be in her own house. In her childhood a girl should be under the \nwill of her father; in her youth under that of her husband; her \nhusband being dead, under the will of her sons. A woman should never \nenjoy her own will. Though of bad conduct or debauched, a husband \nmust always be worshipped like a god by a good wife." ?0 \n\nRules similar to those of the Brahmans were established in \nwestern Europe by Christian authorities, insofar as possible. Some \nchurches even insisted that a bride at her wedding must kneel and \nplace her bridegroom\'s foot on her head in token of abject obedience. 51 \nChristianity accepted marriage only on condition that the partners \nform a slave-and-master relationship. This meant getting rid of the \nGoddess whose many forms and avatars protected the married \nwoman in all phases of matrimony and motherhood. \n\nJuno, the Roman Queen of Heaven, regulated every aspect of \nmarriage through her priestesses. Juno Pronuba arranged marriages. \nJuno Domiduca conducted the bride across the threshold of her new \nI home. Juno Nuxia perfumed the doorposts. Juno Cinxia untied the \nbride\'s virgin-girdle. Juno Lucina watched over the pregnant woman. \nJuno Ossipago strengthened her infant\'s bones. Juno Rumina provid- \ned mother\'s milk. Juno Sospita took care of women in childbed. 32 So it \nwent: in marriage and family matters, women ignored God and \nappealed to their own Goddess. The idea that a male priest should \npreside alone over a marriage ceremony was unthinkable which is \none reason why Christians didn\'t think of it. For many centuries, \nmarriage existed in a limbo without a deity to solemnize it, having no \nplace in canon law, which is why marriage remained so long under the \njurisdiction of common law. \n\nThe Council of Trent decreed that a person who even hinted that \nthe state of matrimony might be more blessed than celibacy would be \n\n\n\n589 \n\n\n\nMarriage declared anathema accursed and excommunicated. 33 The earliest \n\nform of Christian marriage was a simple blessing of the newly wedded \nj^ m ^ pair, in facie ecclesiae outside the church\'s closed doors to keep the \npollution of lust out of God\'s house. This blessing was a technical \nviolation of canon law, but it became popular and gradually won \nacceptance. In 1215 the fourth Lateran Council granted it legal \nstatus. 34 Still, the church maintained that there were no marriages in \nheaven, according to Christ\'s statement in the scriptures (Mark \n12:25; Luke 20:35). St. Thomas Aquinas assigned a "goodness value" \nof 30 to marriage, as compared with 60 for widowhood, and 100 for \nlifelong virginity. 35 \n\nMedieval folk tales convey a distinct impression that the Christian \nGod opposed marriage. One story said a pure youth and maiden \nagreed never to marry, "for love of God." But their heathen parents \nforced them into a wedding. By God\'s grace, the ground opened \nunder their feet and swallowed them before they could spoil their \nvirginity. A priest who dared officiate at the wedding was found dead \nnext day. Another young couple eloped, being forced to defy God, who \n"did not sanction earthly marriages." Gebhard, archbishop of Co- \nlogne, was said to have blessed married couples illegally, and even toi \nwife himself. He was excommunicated, besieged by Catholic forces \nin Godesberg Castle, caught, and killed. The ruins of his castle are sti! \nshown to travelers. 36 \n\nCommon-law marriages were often informal. Mere cohabitation \ncould constitute a valid marriage. 37 Temporary trial marriages were \nlegal up to the early 17th century. Peasant "betrothals" were often trial \nmarriages, incorporating such customs as "tarrying," night-visiting, \nand courting-on-the-bed. Pregnancy might make the union permanent, \nbut not necessarily. Bastardy was a commonplace in all social classes \nof medieval society. 38 \n\nThe church displayed remarkable reluctance to deal with the \nmatter of marriage at all. During the Middle Ages there was no \necclesiastical definition of a valid marriage nor of any contract to validate \none. Churchmen seemed to have no ideas at all on the subject. 39 \nThey ignored marriage, leaving it largely in the realm of the common \nlaw. \n\nUnder Roman and barbarian laws, marriages "could be freely \ninitiated and could be terminated without formality by either party \nand at any time." 40 This system persisted among common folk until \n1 563. Finally the church declared the priestly blessing indispensable \nto a legal marriage, refusing to recognize any more marriages made by \nthe common law. Still, the church\'s rule remained invalid in many \nareas for several centuries more. 41 \n\nIn 1753 Lord Harwicke\'s Act made clerical blessing a requirement \nfor legal marriage in England, but the Act didn\'t apply to Scotland. \nTherefore Scotland became a mecca for elopements, because legal \nmarriages could be made there by the old pagan custom of "handfast- \n\n\n\n590 \n\n\n\nling" simply joining the couple\'s hands in the presence of witnesses, \ni I without benefit of clergy. 42 All the way up to 1939, English lovers \nil could travel across the Scottish border to the "marriage town" of Gretna \nI Green for an instant wedding. \n\nWhen Christian authorities revised pagan marriage laws, they were \nI primarily concerned with placing a wife\'s property in her husband\'s \n| control and keeping it there. Women owned the land under the pagan \n{system, and their husbands could acquire an interest in it only \n\nthrough matrimony. This system was reversed in husbands\' favor. \nICommon-law and Morganatic marriages were provisionally accepted \nI by Christian churches only after many restrictions had been imposed on \nthe wife\'s rights of ownership and inheritance. Christian marital \nf morality amounted to taking the means of independence from women \nfland turning it over to men. \n\nCelibacy was strictly enforced among the clergy when new laws \nMpermitted men to bequeathe their property (and their wives\' proper- \nty) directly to their children. When priests were forbidden to make valid \nDmarriages, they couldn\'t have heirs. Thus all property they owned or \nI gained would revert to the church when they died. 43 Clerical marriages, \n\'on the other hand, meant a loss of ecclesiastical income. \n\nPriests abandoned the early church\'s rule of celibacy and began to \ni take wives during the 5th and 6th centuries. This continued to the \nf 1 lth century, when papal decretals commanded married clergymen to \n|tum their wives out of their homes and sell their children as slaves. 44 \nflThese new laws brought much more wealth to the church. Though \nIsome ex-wives stayed on as the concubines of their former husbands, \nI they were disinherited in the church\'s favor. (See Matrilineal \nInheritance.) \n\nChurchmen revered St. Hilary, who was married and the father of \na daughter. When his daughter wished to marry, however, Hilary \nforbade her. Fearing she might weaken and lose her virginity, he asked \n|God to kill her. God complied with a little help from Hilary \nihimself. After burying the daughter, "by his prayer" Hilary sent his wife \nIto heaven also. The legend claims the wife voluntarily begged Hilary \nIto "obtain for her the same grace which he had obtained for her \n(daughter." 45 \n\nBesides popularizing the peculiar morality of a saint who killed his \nfamily, the church fostered "chastisement" of wives by husbands, \nIciting St. Paul\'s teaching that "the head of every man is Christ; and the \nhead of the woman is the man" (1 Corinthians 1 1:3). In practice, \nunder the pretext of discipline a man could torture his wife with \nI impunity, and no legal or religious agency would defend her. A mild \nprotest in the 13th-century Laws and Customs of Beauvais noted that \nJan excessive number of women were dying of marital chastisement, \nso husbands were advised to beat their wives "only within reason." 46 \n\nThe theological view of the time was that "woman has sinned \nmore than man" and should therefore be unhappier; her suffering \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nMorganatic \nmarriage A form of \nlegalized \n\nconcubinage, first \ninstituted in \n\nGermany to allow high- \nranking noblemen \nand princes to "marry" \nwomen of low rank, \nor commoners, with the \nproviso that neither \nwife nor children of the \nmarriage would ever \nhave any legal claim on \nthe husband\'s \nproperty. \n\n\n\n591 \n\n\n\nMarriage must be doubled on earth, even in the womb, which is why female \n\nembryos did not receive their souls from God as early as male \n^^^^^ mma ^^^^ embryos. 47 Men were only doing God\'s will when they made women \nsuffer. \n\nThe Oriental heathen, whom Christians thought barbaric, were \nteaching different rules: "The householder should never punish his \nwife, but should cherish her like a mother. ... By riches, clothes, love, \nrespect, and pleasing words should one\'s wife be satisfied. The \nhusband should never do anything displeasing to her." 48 Westerners \nsimply condemned as obscene the passages in the Brhadaranyaka \nUpanishad describing as a sacrament a husband\'s sexual worship of his \nwife as "House-Goddess (Grhadevata)." 49 \n\nPhysical abuse and sexual coercion were so often the lot of a \nChristian wife that it came to be an accepted idea that no woman \ncould love a husband. A "lover" meant a man outside the marriage. \nThe Countess of Narbonne, ruler of France\'s celebrated Court of \nLove, said the relation between husband and wife and "the true love \nbetween lovers are two absolutely different things which have noth- \ning in common. . . . We say definitely and considerately that love \ncannot exist between married people." 50 One good reason was the \nmaster-slave relationship. "Men were exhorted from the pulpit to beat \ntheir wives and wives to kiss the rod that beat them." 51 \n\nMedieval society was so accustomed to the idea that all wives were \nbattered by their husbands, that churchmen used this as an argument \nfor women to renounce marriage in favor of the cloister. They told \nyoung girls that "the wife was subject to her husband, that often she \nwas exposed to blows and kicks, and often brought forth misshapen \noffspring. . . . While men are betrothed they seem filled with gentle- \nness, whereas after marriage they rule as cruel masters." 52 \n\nIt has been recently shown that, "Although omitted from most \nchurch historical accounts, the Christian church . . . has had a record \nof practicing and recommending physical abuse to women." The \nDecretum of 1 140 said: "It is right that he whom woman led into \nwrongdoing should have her under his direction so that he may not fail \na second time through female levity." Friar Cherubino\'s 1 5th- \ncentury Rules of Marriage made a husband his wife\'s sole judge: "Scold \nher sharply, bully and terrify her. And if this still doesn\'t work . . . take \nup a stick and beat her soundly, for it is better to punish the body and \ncorrect the soul than to damage the soul and spare the body. . . . \nThen readily beat her, not in rage but out of charity and concern for her \nsoul, so that the beating will redound to your merit." " \n\nA Russian pope recommended the use of a whip rather than a rod \nof wood or iron, which was more likely to cripple or kill. "Keep to a \nwhip," said the pontiff, "and choose carefully where to strike: a whip is \npainful and effective." 54 \n\nMartin Luther thought himself an unusually kind husband. He \n\n\n\n592 \n\n\n\nsaid when his wife "gets saucy, she gets nothing but a box on the \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nEnglish jurisprudence applied to marital "disagreement" the fam- \n\n| ous Rule of Thumb elucidated by Blackstone: a husband was free to \n| beat his wife with a whip or rod no thicker than his thumb, "in order to \nenforce the salutary restraints of domestic discipline." British law up \n\nt to the late 19th century decreed that acts which would amount to an \n(assault if committed against a stranger were legally innocent when \ncommitted by a husband against a wife. 56 Wives had little help from the \n\nIjlaw; they were legally classified with minors and idiots, and were \nconsigned to the custody of their husbands. 57 \n\nWhen John Adams was helping to draw up the Constitution of the \nUnited States in 1777, his wife Abigail wrote to him, "Do not put \n\nIsuch unlimited power in the hands of husbands. Remember, all men \n\ntwould be tyrants if they could." 58 Abigail\'s plea went unheard. The \nAmerican husband was no less tyrannical than his British forebear. It has \nbeen said that among the Puritans especially, the husband "exercised \nthe authority of God" over his wife. 59 \n\nIn 1848 feminist Emily Collins described a typical example of the \nabused American wife: a woman who mothered seven children, \ncooked, cleaned, washed, spun, wove, sewed and mended the family \n\nclothing, milked the cows, and took the multiple responsibilities for \nthe welfare of nine persons, including her husband, who beat her \nbecause she sometimes "scolded" that is, nagged, or complained. \nThis was accepted as sufficient reason for violent attacks on his hard- \n\nI working spouse. 60 \n\nUp to the middle of the 20th century, American law upheld the \nso-called doctrine of immunity, which meant the "sanctity of the \nhome" could not be invaded to stop husbandly violence. A man\'s home \nwas his castle, even if it was also his wife\'s prison. The law denied \nwomen the right to sue their husbands for assault because the suit \n"might destroy the peace of the home." Only in 1962 did a judge \nrule that the peace of the home was already destroyed by a wife-beating \nhusband, therefore the doctrine of immunity was legally unsound. 61 \n\nJ Even now, the law may refuse to recognize a woman\'s right to \nprotection within her home. \n\nWife-beating was a by-product of the Christian view of woman \n\nlas man\'s property. Napoleon remarked, "Woman is given us to bear \n\njchildren. She is our property. . . . She is our possession, as the fruit \ntree is that of the gardener." 62 St. Thomas Aquinas said a wife is lower \nthan a slave because a slave may be freed, but "Woman is in \nsubjection according to the law of nature, but a slave is not." 63 \n\nJosephine Henry reported that "The ownership of the wife estab- \nlished and perpetuated through Bible teaching is responsible for the \ndomestic pandemonium and the carnival of wife murder which reigns \nthroughout Christendom. In the United States alone, in the eighteen \n\n\n\nSir William \n\nBlackstone (1723-1780) \nFamous English \njurist, author of the \nCommentaries \nwhich became the \nstandard reference \nauthority of both British \nand American law \nthrough the 19th \ncentury. \n\n\n\nJosephine Henry \n\n19th-century Kentucky \nsuffragist and \npamphleteer, active in \nthe women\'s rights \nmovement. \n\n\n\n593 \n\n\n\nMarriage hundred and ninety-seventh year of the Christian era, 3,482 wives, \n\nmany with unborn children in their bodies, have been murdered in \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m co \'d blood by their husbands. . . . The by-paths of ecclesiastical history \nare fetid with the records of crimes against women; and \'the half has \nnever been told.\'" 64 \n\nFrom feudal times onward, Christian systems of slavery placed \nsimilar powers in the hands of slaveowners and husbands, often \ncombining the two functions. A sister of President Madison wrote: "We \nsouthern ladies are complimented with the name of wives: but we are \nonly the mistresses of seraglios." A southern planter\'s wife described \nherself as "the chief slave of the harem." The wife of a Confederate \ngeneral wrote: "God forgive us, but ours is a monstrous system. . . . \nLike the patriarchs of old, our men live all in one house with their \nwives and their concubines. . . . Any lady is ready to tell you who is the \nfather of all the mulatto children in everybody\'s household but her \nown. Those, she seems to think, drop from the clouds." 65 \n\nSouthern ladies\' doublethink about their roles was an expected, \neven mandatory, social response. The first edition of Emily Post\'s \nEtiquette described "The Instincts of a Lady: As an unhappy wife, her \ndignity demands that she never show her disapproval of her husband, \nno matter how publicly he slights or outrages her." 66 \n\nThough the rule obviously served the man\'s dignity, not the \nwoman\'s, unhappy wives tried to obey it. Patriarchal society managed \nto convince them that if they failed to make their marriages "happy," \nthey failed as women and as human beings. Hence, battered wives \noften accepted the guilt for their own victimization. Recent investigators \nreport that battered wives go to great lengths to conceal the crime \nbecause of their own embarrassment and shame. 67 \n\nChurches helped develop this secret embarrassment. One clergy- \nman\'s routine advice to brides was: "Your duty is submission. . . . \nYour husband is, by the laws of God and of man, your superior; do not \never give him cause to remind you of it." 68 Of all professional groups, \nclergymen have proved least able or willing to help battered wives. \n\nOne abused wife from a "nice suburban neighborhood" wrote of \nher appeal to her clergyman and the reprimand she received. The \nminister demanded to know what she was doing wrong to bring her \nhusband\'s violence down upon herself, and advised her only to search \nher own soul and discover how she might behave better to relieve the \ntension. She had a husband so violent that she feared for her life. Yet \nher spiritual leader and alleged comforter gave her less than no comfort. \nHe tried rather to increase her suffering with a specious burden of \nguilt. 69 \n\nIn 1977 Ellen Kirby of the Board of Global Ministries of the \nUnited Methodist Church wrote: "The institutional church either \nthrough its blatant sexist theology, which has blessed the subordination \nof women, or through its silence, blindness, or lack of courage, has \nallowed itself to be one of the leading actors in the continuing tragedy of \n\n\n\n594 \n\n\n\ni." 70 Under the circumstances it seems unrealistic for Pope Paul \nto have observed in 1966 that "a true contradiction cannot exist \n/een the divine laws pertaining to the transmission of life and \npertaining to the fostering of authentic conjugal love." 71 Translat- \nI from theologese, the "divine laws" meant simply the church\'s \nid on birth control and "authentic conjugal love" meant husbandly \nlinance over the wife. \n\nPatriarchal religions developed many rules for maintaining male \nlinance in marriage, but the structure was inherently unstable: \n\nThe patriarchal "family" of academic social science is but a euphemism \nfor the individualistic male with his subordinate dependents. As a social \nunit the family means the (male) individual activated by his most \naggressively individualistic instincts; it is not the foundation, but the \nnegation of society. . . . \n\nHuman society did not arise as an organization of adjusted interests. \nIt arose out of an extra-rational sentiment; it has never existed in any \nform except through the binding force of such sentiments. n \n\nThe patriarchal family was at bottom unnatural, a reversal of the \nogical authority of the female over her dependents. "Economic man \nicis in perfect self-interest; a woman cannot base her relationships \n[vithin the family on the principle of quid pro quo: she gives. It appears, \nrom a masculinist perspective, that woman might be a more primi- \ntive version of a man not because there is prima facie evidence of her \nower intelligence, but because of her loving and giving nature, which \nIs itself taken as evidence of lower intelligence. Rousseau\'s \'noble \njiavage\' like his ideal woman was compassionate and nurturing." 75 \n\nAs a rule, women were driven into marriage by social pressures \npat made spinsterhood even less attractive economically. When \npatriarchal laws took property out of women\'s hands and placed it in the \nlands of men, unmarried women became as helpless to support \npemselves as wives were. In the 1 7th century, a "spinster" was any \nwoman imprisoned in a "spin-house" without money or male protec- \ntors. John Evelyn described a spin-house as a place where "incorrigible \nbid lewd women are kept in discipline and labor." 74 It was seldom \nnoticed that spinsters had become "incorrigible and lewd" in an effort to \nparn a living, in a society that allowed them to learn no skills other \n(than trying to please men. \n\nThough patriarchal marriage typically existed for the service of \nman, there was usually a pretense of male autonomy and leadership; \nand the discovery of its mythical quality caused the wife\'s "basic \ntrauma," according to Jessie Bernard: \n\nThere are few traumas greater . . . than the wife\'s discovery of her \nhusband\'s dependencies; than the discovery of her own gut-superiority \nin a thousand hidden crannies of the relationship; than the realization that \nin many situations his judgment is no better than hers; that he does not \nreally know more than she; that he is not the calm, rational, nonemotional \ndealer in facts and relevant arguments; that he is, in brief, not at all the \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nJohn Evelyn (1620- \n\n1706) English \ngentleman of letters, \nauthor of about 30 \nbooks including a \nfamous diary. \n\n\n\nJessie Bernard \n\nModern American fem- \ninist author and \nsociological researcher. \n\n\n\n595 \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nMarlene Dixon \n\nModern feminist, \nwriter, and teacher of \nsociology at a Canadian \nuniversity. \n\n\n\nkind of person the male stereotype pictures him to be. Equally, if not \nmore, serious is her recognition that she is not really the weaker vessel, \nthat she is often called upon to be the strong one in the relationship. 75 \n\nMarc Feigen Fastau also pointed out that false commitment to \nthe myth of masculine steadiness and objectivity brings on disillusion- \nment among wives: \n\nNothing contrasts more sharply with the masculine image of self-confi- \ndence, rationality, and control than men\'s sulky, obtuse, and, often \nvirtually total, dependence on their wives to articulate and deal with their \nown unhappy feelings and their own insensitivity, fear, and passivity in \nhelping their wives to deal with theirs. This, more than anything else, \ndisillusions women about their men. Bromides like \'Men are just \novergrown little boys\' are both a description of the phenomenon and an \nattempt, by labeling it innocuously, to ease the pain of disillusionment: \ndisillusionment at having subordinated yourself to a person who isn \'t, it \nturns out, special enough to justify the sacrifice, who is probably not \nmuch smarter than you are in most ways and in some very important ways \nis a lot less perceptive, more dependent and more childlike. 76 \n\nThough wives provide an essential support system, without \nwhich few men would be capable of carrying on productive careers, the \n"job" of a wife is the last relic of slavery in that it earns nothing. A \nwoman can\'t collect unemployment insurance for losing this non-paid \njob, even when it means financial hardship for herself and her \nchildren. As a widow she is taxed at the highest level because she is not \nconsidered a contributor to her husband\'s estate. Yet a conservative \nestimate of the market value of a wife\'s services amounts to over \n$1,000,000. Nor is the job an easy one. Data collected by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services show that housewives \nsuffer more from symptoms of stress than do working women. 77 \n\nMarlene Dixon said marriage is "the chief vehicle for the perpetu- \nation of the oppression of women; it is through the role of wife that \nthat subjugation of women is maintained." 78 To a large extent it was th< \nChristian concept of marriage in the western world that brought this \nabout, since the church declared women socially, politically, and intel- \nlectually inferior and made them their husband\'s chattels. 79 \nWife-beating was so routine in Christian Europe that the standard \nsymbol of "marriage" in Alsatian New Year decorations was a \nminiature man beating his miniature wife. 80 \n\nNineteenth-century clergymen in both Europe and America con- \nsistently upheld a husband\'s right to abuse his wife and to use \n"salutary restraints in every case of misbehavior," without the interfer- \nence of what some court records of 1824 referred to as "vexatious \nprosecutions." In other words, it was vexatious for a battered wife to \nseek redress, but not vexatious for her husband to beat her in the first \nplace. Many clergymen still have this attitude. A battered wife recently \nsaid: "My husband repeatedly spoke scripture at me about what a \nwife\'s responsibility was. . . . She was supposed to be submissive, and he \n\n\n\n596 \n\n\n\nm \n\n\n\nivould quote Paul, verse after verse after verse. I didn\'t feel like I had Mars \n\nlery much to fight with. ... I don\'t recall any clergy person I went to \n\nknd I went to more than one being supportive of my feelings about ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhot continuing the marriage, of not wanting the abuse to continue. I got \n\n|io support from any clergyman." 81 \n\nOnly recently, and grudgingly, did the clergy of some denomina- \ntions remove the word "obey" from the bride\'s responses in the \n[narriage service. Many clergymen still believe a wife should bow to her \nhusband\'s wishes more than he bows to hers not the best attitude in \nfnen who think themselves qualified to act as marriage counselors. \n\n1.

The inscription of \n\nDarius at Behistun says the god was incarnate in a sacred king slain by Sign of Mars \n\nlis people. 2 His spirit ruled what Sufis still call the "fulfilling" death- \n\nirjdriebirth process, known as mardiyya or martyrdom. 3 An early \n\nPhrygian version of the same sacrificial god appears in Greek myth as \n\nhe flayed satyr Marsyas, slain on a pine tree "between heaven and \n\njarth" by order of the heavenly father. \n\nMars was "red" because his basic Indo-European prototype was \nhe pre-Vedic flayed god Rudra, father of the Maruts or sacrificial \nvictims, red with their own blood. Rudra "the red one" was born of the \nhree-faced virgin-mother Marici, Goddess of birth, dawn, and the \n^ew Year, a manifestation of the ancient feminine Trinity. Thus, \nludra bore the title of Tryambaka, "He Who Belongs to Three \n\n\n\n\n597 \n\n\n\nMartin, Saint Mother Goddesses." In Japan this Goddess was known as Marici-deva \n\nor Marishi-ten, whom later patriarchal writers masculinized as a \n^^^^^^^^^^_ Buddhist monk. However, this alleged monk always wore the garments \nof a woman. 4 \n\nThe same Goddess was Marica to the Latins. She gave birth to the \ngod-king Latinus, ancestor of all Latin tribes. Her consort was the \nflayed goat god of the Lupercalia, Faunus, another incarnation of Mars, \nwho also appeared in bird-soul form as the sacred woodpecker Picus, \ngiving oracles from the top of a phallic pillar in his shrine. 5 \n\nThe Martian New Year sacrifices took place in the god\'s month of \nMarch, which once began the Roman year; this is why the "Ides of \nMarch" were considered dangerous to kings. In the Babylonian sacred \ncalendar, the same New Year month of atonement sacrifices was \nMarcheshvan. 6 The astrological sign of this month still begins the year, \naccording to astrologers\' tradition. \n\nIn northern Europe, Mars was identified with Tiw, Tyr, or Tig: \nnames derived from Indo-Germanic dieus, "God." 7 Just as Mars was \noften confused with the sky-father Jupiter, so Tiw was another name for \nthe sky-father Odin. Tiw\'s sign was a lingam-yoni arrangement of a \nphallic spear attached to a female disc. As wielder of the spear or \nlightning bolt of fertility, Mars-Tiw became a god of battle. He was \nthe patron of Roman warriors, who called him Marspiter (Father Mars) \nand honored him with "martial" exercises on the Campus Martius, \nsite of a temple of Maris in Etruscan times. His sacred day was Tuesday, \nnamed after Tiw in English, though it is still dies martis in Latin and \nsimilarly named in Latinate languages (French mardi). \n\nTo account for the inevitable story that the Queen of Heaven as \nCelestial Virgin gave birth to the sacrificial god, Romans claimed the \nBlessed Virgin Juno spurned the love of her spouse, Jupiter, and to spite \nhim conceived Mars by her own unaided feminine fertility magic, the \nlily blossom that represented her own yoni. 8 \n\n1.

It was claimed that the saint himself was cut up and eaten in \nthe form of an ox. Every household killed some domestic animal and \nsprinkled the threshold with the animal\'s blood. St. Martin as "martyr" \ncame to be regarded as "one of the very chief of the saints. . . . The \ntradition of slaughter is preserved in the British custom of killing cattle \non St. Martin\'s Day." 1 \n\nThe holy day was a continuation of the Roman festival of Martina- \n\n\n\n598 \n\n\n\n/hen the god Bacchus prefigured Jesus by turning water into \n! at his sacred marriage (the Christian adaptation appearing in the \nof John). By British folk custom down to the 19th century \n[d., schoolboys filled vessels of water on St. Martin\'s Night so the water \n\nId be turned into wine before morning. By a benevolent decep- \nlon like that of the Tooth Fairy, parents sometimes replaced the water \nkith wine during the night. 2 \n1. Miles, 204-6. 2. Hazlitt, 393. \n\n\n\nMartyrs \n\n\n\nMartyrs \n\nince the 9th century, when martyr-legends became wildly popular, \n[ne church listed countless bogus saints said to have died in "persecu- \nJons" of the 4th and 5th centuries. With more imagination than \nistoricity, martyrologists created a church history out of fictions. Rec- \nrds of the alleged martyrs slain in "persecutions" are virtually \nbnexistent. The gory fantasies reported by such sources as the Golden \nlegend were invented from six to nine centuries after the time of the \n! leged events. Even Catholic scholars say martyrologists\' tales are so \nnildishly naive that when reading them "it is often difficult to refrain \npm smiling." \' \n\nStill, one might wonder why a smile should be the response to \nhese grisly fantasies of torture and butchery, which hint at a sadistic \nlirn of mind in those who invented such tales for the edification of their \ni [How Christians. \n\nMost of the classic martyrs were assigned to the persecution of \nPiocletian, which Christian tradition greatly exaggerated. Diocletian \nLade no objection to Christians until 298 a.d., when his priests claimed \nthristian unbelievers, present at an official sacrifice, prevented the \nception of favorable omens. The emperor ordered Christians to honor \ne gods by burning a pinch of incense on the imperial altars. For \nlose in the army or civil service, refusal to comply with this rule could \n[lean discharge. Five years later, quarrels between Christian and \nligan priesthoods escalated to the point where official oracles began to \nllsist on the closing of Christian churches. Some Christian zealots \nItok it on themselves to strike back by attacking the emperor himself. \n\nTwo fires were set in Diocletian\'s palace at Nicomedia. Three \nlihristian eunuchs, residents in the palace, were accused of arson and \nIcecuted. Centuries later they were canonized as Saints Dorotheus, \njtorgonius, and Peter. 2 After the fires, Diocletian also ordered the \nItest of some Christian priests. Martin Jones says "Some months later, \nHie imprisoned clergy were all forced to sacrifice, and then, with the \nIcception of a few obstinate reclusants, released." Some of the obstinate \nHies were executed. But the "persecution" was never more than \nHilf-hearted. Though it continued intermittently for a while, it was \nIntirely abandoned by 3 1 3 a.d.* \n\n\n\nThe Golden \nLegend Collection of \nthe "lives" of various \nsaints, with emphasis on \nmartyrdoms and \nmiracle tales, written by \nJacobus de Voragine, \na 13th-century \nDominican bishop in \nLombardy, later \narchbishop of \nGenoa. \n\n\n\nDiocletian (Gaius \nAurelius Valerius \nDiocletianus) \nRoman emperor from \n284 to 305 a.d. Of \nmilitary background, \nDiocletian was noted \nfor his economic and \nadministrative \nreforms. \n\n\n\n599 \n\n\n\nMartyrs These ten years and comparatively few deaths were blown up into \n\na legendary reign of terror, after the teachings of the primitive church \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m were forgotten. One of these teachings was that martyrdom, called "the \nCrown," automatically brought Christlike apotheosis and made the \nsoul of the martyr one with Jesus, as the soul of an Egyptian could \nbecome one with Osiris. In pursuit of this "imitation of Christ," so \nmany Christians purposely broke laws and clamored for the death \npenalty that Antoninus of Antioch irritably inquired whether Chris- \ntians had no ropes or precipices to kill themselves, without constantly \nmaking trouble for the authorities. 4 \n\nSome of the early churches taught that martyrdom was required t( \nbe among the blessed in heaven. Apocryphal Gospels quoted Jesus: \n"Truly I say to you, none of those who fear death will be saved; for the \nkingdom of death belongs to those who put themselves to death." \nTertullian said he longed for martyrdom, "that he may obtain from Go \ncomplete forgiveness, by giving in exchange his blood." Gnostics \nhowever ridiculed martyrdom, saying it made God a cannibal who \ndesired human blood; and the advocates of martyrdom were said to \ninflict it on each other all too often. Some Gnostic writings denounced \nother Christians for "oppressing their brothers" and even making \nchildren suffer, to save their souls. 5 This was one of the sources of the \ncharge that Christians sacrificed children to their deity. 6 Centuries \nlater, Christians used the same charge of child sacrifice to justify \npersecution of the Jews. 7 \n\nIn reality, Rome embraced many diverse faiths, Christianity \namong them, with far more tolerance than Christians showed. Angus \nsays, "In the matter of intolerance Christianity differed from all pagan \nreligions, and surpassed Judaism; in that respect it stood in direct \nopposition to the spirit of the age." 8 Some of the so-called persecutors \nwere actually trying to stop the fighting between different factions of \nChristians, like the emperor Maxentius who arrested the rival popes \nMarcellus and Eusebius to prevent further street battles between their \nfollowers. Another pair of rival popes, Damasus and Ursinus, precipitat \ned such bloody fighting that 137 corpses were left in the basilica of \nSicininus in only one day. Ammianus reported that "It was only with \ndifficulty that the people, having been roused to such ferocity, could \nbe brought back to order." 9 \n\nA persecution, rich in martyrdoms, was expected from the "Apos- \ntate" emperor Julian, an urbane pagan who disliked fanatical \nChristians. But Julian disappointed them by leaving them alone. Greg- \nory of Nazianzus held even Julian\'s tolerance against him: "He \nbegrudged to our soldiers the honor of martyrdom. ... In order that wc \nmight suffer, and yet not win honor as we should, suffering for \nChrist\'s sake ... he attacked our religion in a very villainous and \nungenerous way, introducing into his persecution the traps and snares \nof argument." Julian was killed in a military camp, under odd circum- \nstances. According to Libanius, the emperor was assassinated by a \n\n\n\n600 \n\n\n\nchristian less inclined to argue, more inclined to destroy the Martyrs \n\n(pponent. 10 \n\nThere are no verifiable contemporary records of individual Chris- ^^^^^^^^^^^ \ntans "slain for their faith" under the Roman empire. Eusebius \nU. 371 a.d.) mentioned a letter, supposedly from the churches of Lyons \nnd Vienne to the churches of Asia and Phrygia, listing the names of \n[8 Christians executed in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, 177 a.d., nearly \nwo hundred years earlier. 11 Eusebius probably wrote the letter \n^imself. It was he who adopted the principle of "holy lying" on the \nhurch\'s behalf. Ever afterward, churchmen cited Eusebius to prove \nnat any lie is permissible if it glorifies the Christian faith. 12 \n\nAside from this father of "holy lying" and his dubious letter, no \nnartyrs\' names were heard of until the 7th to 9th centuries. A \npajority were only names or titles of old pagan deities whose shrines had \n|een pilgrimage centers since pre-Christian times. \n\nThe real martyrs of the early Christian era were not made by the \nlagans so much as by their fellow Christians. Diocletian\'s persecution \nlas negligible compared to the violent warfare of Christian against \nChristian in those centuries. Zealots in Asia Minor destroyed whole \npwns and villages and massacred thousands of "heretics." Women and \nhildren were tortured until they agreed to receive the Host of the \nrue faith. Ammianus said "no wild beasts are so hostile to man as \nChristian sects in general are to one another." 1? Toleration itself was \n[unishable. At Trier in the 4th century two bishops, Priscillian and \npstantius, with two other men and a woman, were illegally tortured \nnd executed by their fellow Christians for being too tolerant of their \nlagan neighbors. 14 \n\nIn the 5th century, Innocent I proclaimed that God gave the \nhurch the right to kill. Its military might "had been granted by God \nnd the sword had been permitted for the punishment of the guilty" \n(leaning anyone holding unorthodox opinions. 15 A letter attributed \np Clement, bishop of Rome, said whoever refuses to "bow the neck" to \nGod\'s bishops, priests, and deacons is guilty of insubordination \n{gainst God and must suffer the death penalty. 16 \n\nOnce in power, the church attacked both pagans and non-ortho- \npx Christians in a reign of terror. By a conservative estimate, pagan \nmperors spilled less than one ten-thousandth of the amount of Chris- \nan blood later shed by other Christians. 17 The persecutions in Asia \nMinor were thus described in 386 a.d.: \n\nThe monks say they are making war on the temples but their warfare is i \nway of pillaging what little poor unfortunates do have, the produce of \nthe fields and the cattle they feed. . . . They grab people\'s land, claiming \nthe place is sacred. Many have been robbed of their patrimony on such \na pretext. They who (as they say) give honor to their god by fasting are \ngetting fat on the wretchedness of others. \n\nAnd as for those others, the victims of such a sack, if they go to \ntown, to a "shepherd" he will be called that, though he may not be a \n\n\n\n601 \n\n\n\nMary good shepherd precisely and tell him, weeping, of their injustices suf- \n\nfered, the shepherd will approve of the pillagers, and chase their victims \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ away, saying that they should count it a gain that they have not suffered \n\nworse. \n\nIf they hear of a place with something worth raping away, they \nimmediately claim that someone is making sacrifices and committing \nabominations, and pay the place a visit. \' 8 \n\nChristian zealots sometimes tortured pagan women to make \nthem renounce their Goddess. 19 This may have been the real origin of \nthe many fictitious "virgin martyrs" said to have renounced love and \nmarriage to embrace Christian celibacy, retaining their virginity despite \nthe most horrendous tortures. Catholic writers now call the church\'s \nvirgin-martyr horror tales only "edifying romance" though why these \nsadistic fantasies should seem edifying is not made clear. 20 Christian \ntales of the pagans\' execution of virgins made no sense in any case; for \nunder Roman law, no virgin could be executed. If sentenced to \ndeath, a virgin had to be legally deflowered before sentence could be \ncarried out. 21 No Roman law made virginity perse a crime. \n\nThe real reason why the church demanded martyr-myths was that \nit was the best traditional way to achieve union with a deity and \nconsequent immortality. From the earliest ideas of sacred kingship, he \nwho died in agony could become at once one with his God. The very \nword martyr was the name of the ancient sacred king in Persia, Martiya- \nImmanuel (see Mars). 22 The Fourth Book of Maccabees, written \nabout the 1st century B.C., provided a typical scriptural model for \nChristian martyrologists. It described the sufferings of the Jew Elea- \nzar and his companions, who endured the usual sequence of flayings, \nburnings, scourgings, disembowellings, etc., couched in loftily meta- \nphorical prose: "Eleazar, like a fine steersman steering the ship of \nsanctity on the sea of the passions, though buffeted by the threats of \nthe tyrant and swept by the swelling waves of the tortures, never shifted \nfor one moment the helm of sancity until he sailed into the haven of \nvictory over death." 2? \n\n1.

Churchmen knew the same titles were applied to Mary as to \nher pagan forerunners: "queen of heaven, empress of hell, lady of all \n[the world." 2 \n\nThe Speculum beatae Mariae said Mary was like the Juno- \nUrtemis-Hecate trinity: "queen of heaven where she is enthroned in \nIthe midst of the angels, queen of earth where she constantly manifests \njher power, and queen of hell where she has authority over the \njdemons." According to the Office of the Virgin, she was the primordial \nbeing, "created from the beginning and before the centuries." 3 \n\nChristian patriarchs therefore sought to humanize and belittle \n(Mary, to prove her unworthy of adoration. Epiphanius ordered: "Let \nithe Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be worshipped, but let no one \nI [worship Mary." 4 Anastasius said, "Let no one call Mary the Mother \npf God, for Mary was but a woman, and it is impossible that God should \nbe born of a woman." 5 Ambrose called Mary the "temple" of God, \nend "only he is to be adored who worked within the temple." 6 Up to \n1 the 5th century the church persecuted as heretics a sect calling \n(themselves Marianites, who claimed that Mary possessed the true \nquality of divinity. 7 Mariolatry has plagued Christian patriarchy \nthroughout its history, as the popular need to worship the Mother-figure \nalways arose unbidden. \n\nSome early church fathers sought a way out of the dilemma by \n\\ attacking Mary\'s motherhood, to prove her neither divine nor really \nnaternal. Some claimed Jesus wasn\'t born in the ordinary way but \n! suddenly materialized before Mary. 8 Marcionites said Jesus could \n[never touch vulgar female flesh, therefore he was never born at all. He \ndescended from heaven as a fully formed adult. 9 Some church fathers \nrejected Mary\'s motherhood on the ground that she was not only a \n\\ mere mortal, but even a sinful woman. 10 \n\nThere was ecclesiastical opposition to Mary throughout the Chris- \ni lian era. Pope Nicholas III ordered Jean d\'Olive, a friar \n{\'distinguished for learning and piety," to burn with his own hands a \n| Tact he had written in praise of Mary because it expressed excessive \nHevotion to her. 11 When it was permitted, Marian devotion did appear \n|o take on an Oriental extravagance. \n\nGermanus, Patriarch of Constantinople in 717, called Mary "Lady \nIpll-holy" and "Lady most venerable," maintaining that no one could \ni be saved or receive the gift of grace except through her, since God \nIpbeys her "through and in all things, as his true mother." Henri \n| poudon, archdeacon of Evreux, said his people thought Mary "as much \nis, or more than, God himself." Isidore Glabas said Mary ruled in \nleaven before her earthly birth; like a creatress she brought all things \nI nto being, and all the angels obeyed her. Bernardine of Siena said \n( Mary\'s birth of the Savior through her own mystic powers was more \n\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\nSpeculum beatae \nMariae A book of \npraise attributed to \nSt. Bonaventura (13th \ncentury), but \nprobably written \nanonymously some \ncenturies later. \n\n\n\nIsidore Glabas \n\n14th-century Greek \nMarianist theologian. \n\n\n\nSt. Bernardine of \nSiena (1380-1444) \nFranciscan \n\ntheologian and reformer \nwho preached \nagainst the moral \nbreakdown \nconsequent upon the \npapacy\'s Great \nSchism. \n\n\n\n603 \n\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\nSt. Louis-Marie \nCrignion de Montfort \n\n(1673-1716) French \npriest who founded two \ncongregations and \nwrote True Devotion to \nthe Blessed Virgin. \nHe was canonized in \n1947. \n\n\n\nProtoevangelium, \n\nalso known as the \nRevelation of James: \na Gospel written in the \nsecond century a.d., \nvalued by early church \nfathers as authentic \nbut eventually \neliminated from the \n\n\n\nmiraculous than God\'s generation of him. "Even if she had not been \nthe Mother of God, she would nevertheless have been the mistress of \nthe world." Louis-Marie de Montfort declared that Mary had abso- \nlute power over God. 12 \n\nPeople of the Middle Ages often viewed God as their persecutor, \nMary as their defender. Early 16th-century woodcuts showed God \nshooting arrows of pestilence, war, and inflation at the world, while the \ninscription pleaded with Mary to restrain him. 13 It was said that \n"Mary stands for Mercy, and it is only because of her influence at cour \nnot because of love or goodwill on God\'s part, that heaven is within \nreach." M A 14th-century Franciscan wrote: \n\nWhen we have offended Christ, we should go Erst to the Queen of \nHeaven and offer her . . . prayers, fasting, vigils, and alms; then she, like \na mother, will come between thee and Christ, the father who wishes to \nbeat us, and she will throw the cloak of mercy between the rod of \npunishment and us, and soften the king\'s anger against us. 1S \n\nAshe says, "Christian scripture and doctrine totally preclude \nplacing Mary above Christ. Yet the vitality of Christ\'s own Church has \noften seemed to depend on her rather than him. . . . [Wjithout her he \nwould probably have lost his kingdom." 16 During its first five centuries, \nChrist\'s church discovered that no amount of force would make \npeople renounce their Mother Goddess. She had to be preserved in \nsome form: \n\nThe church seemed doomed to failure, destined to go down to bloody \ndeath amidst the bleeding corpses of its victims, when the people \ndiscovered Mary. And only when Mary, against the stern decrees of the \nchurch, was dug out of the oblivion to which Constantine had assigned \nher and became identified with the Great Goddess was Christianity finally \ntolerated by the people. . . . The only reality in Christianity is Mary, the \nFemale Principle, the ancient goddess reborn. l7 \n\nIn the eastern empire it was said the mark of true Christian faith \nwas to "confess the holy Ever-Virgin Mary, truly and properly the \nMother of God, to be higher than every creature whether visible or \ninvisible." Ephraem of Syria called Mary the bride or spouse of Jesus as \nwell as his mother, after the fashion of the pagan Goddess and her \nson-consort; she was also Gate of Heaven, Ark, and Garden of Paradise. \nMary personally sprinkled the face of Adam with life-giving rain, \nwhich placed her in the creation myth as "co-redemptress." Ephraem\'s \nopinions were called heretical by some, but after a lapse of 1 600 \nyears in the year 1920 he was declared a Doctor of the Universal \nChurch by papal decree. 18 \n\nThe Christian figure of Mary was gradually created during the first \nfour centuries of the Christian era, out of bits and pieces of the Great \nGoddess who conceived "sons of God" and Saviors in all the temples of \nthe ancient world. The Protoevangelium said Mary served as a \ntemple hierodule, and received God\'s seed as she was beginning to spin \n\n\n\n604 \n\n\n\na blood-red thread in the temple the work of the Fate-virgin, first of \nthe Moerae or "Marys," who spun the thread of destiny. 19 At this \nmystically crucial moment the angel Gabriel "came in unto her" \n(Luke 1:28), the biblical phrase for sexual intercourse. \n\nOther sources also identified Mary with the Fate-spinner, whom \nthe Greeks called Clotho, youngest of the trinity of Moerae. The \nCoptic Discourse on Mary, attributed to Cyril of Jerusalem, represented \nMary as the same triple Goddess of Fate, incarnate in the three \nMarys who stood at the foot of Jesus\'s cross. 20 In like manner, the three \nFates of Nordic myth stood at the foot of Odin\'s tree of sacrifice; their \nvirgin aspect was sometimes Freya, "the Lady." The Swedes called the \nconstellation of Orion the distaff of the virgin Mary, because it was \nformerly the distaff used by Freya to spin the destinies of men. 21 \n\nGreek myth presented an image of the Virgin Persephone almost \nidentical to that of fate-spinning Mary. Persephone sat in a sacred \ncave or temple, starting to spin a web with a great picture of the \nuniverse the magic picture which the Mother made into reality. At \nthat moment the Heavenly Father appeared in the form of a phallic \nserpent and begot the savior Dionysus on her. 22 \n\nIn an effort to make Mary\'s impregnation as sexless as possible, \nsome Christian ascetics invented very peculiar mechanisms for it. \nSacred art showed semen emanating from God\'s mouth and passing \nthrough a long tube that led under Mary\'s skirts. Some theologians \nclaimed God\'s seed was carried to Mary in the beak of the Holy Dove. \nOthers said it came from Gabriel\'s mouth, to be filtered through the \nsacred lily before entering Mary\'s body by way of her ear. 23 \n\nThough the Christian God took over the Triple Goddess\'s ancient \ntrinitarian character at the Council of Nicaea, there is some evidence \nthat early Christians perceived Mary as a trinity. Like the Buddhists\' \nMara, she was sometimes a spirit of death. 24 The Gospel of Mary \nidentified all three of the Marys at Jesus\'s crucifixion with one another, \nas if they were the same Triple Goddess who attended the death of \nthe pagan Savior. 25 \n\nFor some centuries, eastern churches worshipped a Father-Mother- \nSon trinity modeled on such pagan triads as Osiris-Isis-Horus, \nZeus-Rhea-Zagreus, Apollo-Artemis-Heracles, etc. This idea was so \ncommonplace that even writers of the Koran felt compelled to deny \nthe divine trinity of God, Mary, and Jesus. 26 Moslem sources also \npreserved another manifestation of the Virgin Goddess as Mar \nMariam or Sancta Maria, mother of the Persian savior Mani. 27 As "the \nSea" (Maria), the Triple Goddess swallowed up the god she gave \nbirth to. In solemn imitation, the women of Alexandria threw images of \nOsiris into the sea after his Passion Play. 28 Hebraic copies of this rite \nprobably account for Plutarch\'s report that the chief city of Palestine \nJerusalem was built in honor of a child whom Isis killed and threw \ninto the sea. 29 \n\nMary was also closely associated with the Great Goddess of \n\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\nGospel of Mary One \n\nof the early Gnostic \nGospels, once \nincluded with the books \nof the New \nTestament but later \neliminated from the \ncanon. A copy was \nrediscovered in the \n1940s at Nag Hammadi. \n\n\n\n605 \n\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\nMariale Common \nname of two Marianist \nhandbooks, the first \nwritten by an \nanonymous author \nand falsely ascribed to \nAlbertus Magnus; \nthe second written in \n1478 by the \nFranciscan friar \nBernardine of Busti. \n\n\n\nEphesus, whose temples she took over. In the 5th century an \nEphesian priest named Proclus delivered a sermon on the multiform \nnature of Mary, calling her "the living bush, which was not burnt by \nthe fire of the divine birth . . . virgin and heaven, the only bridge \nbetween God and men, the awesome loom ... on which the gar- \nment of union was woven." 30 \n\nMuch was made of the reversal of Mary\'s Latin Ave and the name \nof Eve (Eva). Mystics said Mary was Eve\'s purified reincarnation, as \nJesus was the similar reincarnation of Adam. 31 Somehow, theologians \nfailed to recognize that the new incarnations apparently reversed the \nparent-child relationship. Then again, as Adam and Eve were spouses, \nso the relationship of Mary and Jesus sometimes verged on the sexual \nor conjugal. In a legend ascribed to St. John, Jesus welcomed Mary into \nheaven with the words, "Come, my chosen, and I shall set thee in my \nseat, for I have coveted the beauty of thee." 32 \n\nThe church\'s doctrine of the assumption of Mary was explained in \na number of ways. Early churchmen declared that Jesus visited \nMary\'s tomb variously located in Ephesus, Bethlehem, Gethsemane, \nor Josaphat and raised up her corpse, which he made to live again; \nthen he personally escorted her into heaven as a live woman. 33 She was \nnot a soul or a spirit but an immortal person in her own original body. \nThis became the official modern view when the doctrine of the \nassumption was declared an article of faith in 1950, when Pope Pius \nXII pronounced that "the immaculate mother of God, the ever Virgin \nMary, when the course of her earthly life was run, was assumed in \nbody and in soul to heavenly glory." 34 But the point had already been \nargued for more than a thousand years. \n\nThe church\'s problem was to take advantage of popular reverence \nfor Mary but at the same time prevent her literal deification. Some \ntheologians of the 13 th century claimed Mary\'s mortality should bring \nmore women to obey the church, because the king of heaven "is no \nmere man but a mere woman is its queen. It is not a mere man who is \nset above the angels and all the rest of the heavenly court, but a mere \nwoman is; nor is anyone who is merely man as powerful there as a mere \nwoman." 35 \n\nAlways the theologians feared to impute too much power and \nglory to Mary. Pope John XXIII, presuming to know Mary\'s inner \nthoughts, announced: "The Madonna is not pleased when she is put \nabove her Son," though in fact it was the church who was not \npleased. Catholic doctrines themselves attributed to her two of the three \nbasic characteristics of divinity: she was immortal by reason of the \nassumption, and sinless by reason of the Immaculate Conception. \nThe third requirement of divinity, omniscience, was conceded to her \nby popular belief. A 1 3th-century Mariale said she had perfect knowl- \nedge of divine mysteries, understood all scriptures, foresaw the future, \nand knew everything about mathematics, geography, astronomy, alche- \n\n\n\n606 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy, and canon law even in her earthly life, when there was no Mary \n\ncanon and therefore no canon law. 36 A French manuscript illustration \n\nshowed Mary enthroned beside God on Judgment Day, weighing ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsouls in her balances like her prototype the Goddess Maat 3000 years \n\nearlier. 37 (See Alchemy.) \n\nThe Welsh confused Mary with the triadic White Goddess, and \nseldom asked the blessing of God without also imploring the favor of \n"the white Mary." 38 Saints\' tales implied that Mary\'s was the true touch \nof canonization. St. Bernard was ennobled by three drops of milk that \nthe Virgin pressed from her own breast for him. 39 St. Catherine of \nSiena also claimed to have been nourished by Mary\'s milk. 40 \n\nMany legends depicted Mary as the only true source of the milk of \nhuman kindness. At Mainz Cathedral she gave away one of her \nimage\'s gold shoes to a starving beggar, who had pleased her by playing \nhis fiddle for her. He was caught with the shoe, arrested, and \nsentenced to death. On the way to the scaffold he paused to pray to the \nVirgin, and she exonerated him by publicly giving him her other \nshoe. The beggar was released, but the priests took away the gold shoes \nand locked them in the treasury, "lest the Virgin should again be \ntempted to bestow them upon some penniless beggar who prayed for \nher aid." 41 \n\nMary\'s mercy often proved superior to that of God or Jesus. She \nwas occasionally represented leaning on the balance that weighed a \nsinner\'s few good deeds, to make them heavier than his evil deeds \nand save him from damnation. Her mercy extended even to the Jews, \ndespite her priests\' detestation of them. On Easter Day in Bourges, a \nJewish child took Holy Communion along with his Christian friends. \nFor this offense, the boy\'s father threw him into a furnace; but he lay \nunharmed by the fire, saying the Lady who stood on the Christians\' \naltar was protecting him. "Then the Christians, understanding that \nhe meant the statue of the Blessed Mary, took the aged Jew and threw \nhim into the furnace, and he was burnt and consumed." 42 \n\nEthiopian Christians\' Lefafa Sedek, "Bandlet of Righteousness," \nsaid God gave the secrets of salvation to humanity only because Mary \nrequested it, when she began to grieve for her relatives writhing in hell\'s \nRiver of Fire. Egyptian paganism was the real source of this "Chris- \ntian" scripture, copied from the Book of the Dead with the name of \nGod substituted for Ra, of Christ for that of Thoth, and of Mary for \nthat of All-Merciful Isis. 43 \n\nSome theologians said even the worst of sinners could win a sure \nsalvation by doing some special service for Mary. Two scribes pleased \nher by making copies of the Book of the Miracles of the Virgin Mary. \nAfterward they committed many sins, and when they died, devils \ncame for their souls. But the Virgin pulled them away from the devils, \nsaving them on account of their devotion to her. 44 \n\nAt times it seemed that Mary, not God, was the real opponent of \n\n\n\n607 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary evil forces. Spengler said this was "one of the maxima of the Gothic, \n\none of its unfathomable creations one that the present day forgets and \n\n^^^^^^^^-^ m deliberately forgets It is not possible to exaggerate either the \n\ngrandeur of this forceful, insistent picture or the depth of sincerity with \nwhich it was believed in. The Mary-myths and the Devil-myths \nformed themselves side by side, neither possible without the other. \nDisbelief in either of them was deadly sin. There was a Mary-cult of \nprayer, and a Devil-cult of spells and exorcisms." 45 Historian Henry \nAdams noted: "Without Mary, man had no hope except in atheism, \n\nand for atheism the world was not ready The thirteenth century \n\ncould not afford to admit a doubt. Society had staked its existence, in \nthis world and the next, on the reality and power of the Virgin.""* 6 \n\nCaesarius of Heisterbach told a story showing that Mary was more \nrevered than God. A knight of Liege needed money and so made a \npact with Satan. When asked to curse and renounce God, he did so \nwillingly. However, when the demon required him to renounce the \nVirgin, he refused, horrified. Therefore the Virgin later intervened to \nsave him from damnation. 47 \n\nMary dispensed compassion (Hindu karuna) more effectively than \nChrist, for this very quality had been associated with the feminine \nimage from the beginning. Compassion was the chads of sacred harlots, \nwhich contributed much to Mary\'s consistent patronage of prosti- \ntutes. The "whore" Mary Magdalene was one of the original Marian \ntrinity. 48 Augstein says Mariolatry evolved because "the people need- \ned a queen of heaven, as the Israelites needed one in Jeremiah\'s time, \none for whom they could bake cakes, a great mother, a fertility- \nprostitute; but she was half shown to them, half withheld, and Freud \nonly gives us half the truth when he says that the Christian religion \nrecreated the mother-god." 49 Actually, the people recreated the \nmother-god out of their own pagan heritage. \n\nChurchmen claimed that all women lay under a threefold curse. j \nThey were accursed if they were barren. They were accursed also if \nthey conceived, since conception was of the nature of original sin. They \nwere accursed by the pains of childbirth, in fulfillment of God\'s curse \non Eve. But Mary escaped all three curses. "Mary alone of all women is \nblessed, because she is virgin and fruitful, she conceives in holiness, \nand gives birth without pain." 50 Of course this view of Mary did little to \nimprove the lot of ordinary women, presenting them with a wholly \nimpossible ideal, yet implying that they fell short of the ideal only \nbecause of their sinfulness. 51 The ancients saw no incongruity in a \nGoddess who was both virgin and mother (as well as lover and crone), \nbecause she represented all women in all phases of life. Christians \nhowever insisted on taking the "miracle" literally, having lost sight of its \nsubtle allegory. \n\nA hidden reason for the church\'s adoption of Mary was the \n\n\n\n608 \n\n\n\nuccessful amputation of her pre-Christian sexuality. Of all the Mary \n\nAttributes she inherited from the ancient Goddess, Mary\'s virginity was \n\nTiost emphasized. She was called "the Virgin," not "the Mother." m^mmmhmmmm \n\nChurch fathers insisted that she never engaged in sexual intercourse in \n\nher life, even though the Bible plainly spoke of Jesus\'s brothers and \n\nisters. 52 St. Ambrose demanded, "Would the Lord Jesus have chosen \n\ntor his mother a woman who would defile the heavenly chamber with \n\nhe seed of a man, that is to say one incapable of preserving her virginal \n\nthastity intact?" 53 Marian legends insisted that, although Mary was \n\n[mazingly beautiful, no man could ever look on her with desire. 54 \n\nYet some monasteries institutionalized desire for Mary, who "mar- \nked" the monks as Christ "married" nuns. If a knight placed his ring \nj>n the finger of Mary\'s image, she would grip it firmly so it couldn\'t be \ntemoved. At this, the knight considered himself a Bridegroom of the \nnrgin and entered a monastery. The same tales were told of pagan \nftatues of Venus, who "married" any man who placed a ring on her \nnarble finger. 55 In 1470 a Breton Black Friar, Alain de la Roche, \nlaimed the Virgin married him in the presence of many saints and \nngels, placing on his finger a ring woven of her hair. 56 \n\nCistercians styled themselves "Knights of Our Lady," associating \nheir Lady with the pagan May Queen. Aegidus\'s 1 3th-century \nistory of the order said it was the custom in the time of Bishop Albero \npr the clergy of Liege to choose "from among their concubines" a \nfaschal and Pentecostal Queen, who was robed in purple, crowned, \nnroned, and worshipped with drums and music, "revered almost \nnth idolatry as if she were an idol." 57 She also manifested herself as the \n[airy Queen who watched over a monastery near Laach as the \nnonks\' divine Bride. She announced each man\'s death three days in \npvance by placing a lily in his stall at midnight. 58 \n\nGothic cathedrals were dedicated not to God or Jesus but to Notre \nUame; they were collectively called "Our Ladies" or "Palaces of the \nQueen of Heaven." 59 Many of them were built over pagan shrines of \npe Great Goddess. Rome\'s cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore was \n\'kiilt over the sacred cave of the Magna Mater. Santa Maria in Aracoeli \np the Capitoline Hill was formerly a temple of Tanit. Mary\'s \nhurches throughout Italy were founded on shrines of Juno, Isis, \nMinerva, Diana, Hecate. One church was even naively named Santa \n_Haria sopra Minerva: Holy Mary over (the shrine of) Minerva. 60 \n\nkin the 6th century, the great temple of Isis at Philae was re- \nicated to Mary. 61 Aphrodite\'s sanctuaries on Cyprus became \niurches of Mary, whom the Cypriots continued to address by Aphro- \nite\'s name. 62 At Chartres, the heathen idol of the virgo paritura (Virgin \nliving Birth) was preserved in the so-called Druid Grotto under- \nth the cathedral. It was said to be a black statue of Mary. 63 \nEcclesia, "the Church," was one of Mary\'s titles. She was identi- \n\n\n\n609 \n\n\n\nMary fied with both the buildings and the organization of Holy Mother \n\nChurch as bride and mother of God. Yet this pseudo-female church \n^^^^^^^^^^^ remained the exclusive property of men. As late as February 1977 \nPope Paul VI again forbade ordination of women, saying the church \n"does not consider herself [sic] authorized to admit women to priestly \nordination." The pope maintained that priests must have a "natural \nresemblance" to Christ, and if they were women "it would be \ndifficult to see in the minister the image of Christ." 64 There was no \nmention that a priestess might present a resemblance to Mary, who \nsymbolized the church itself. The modern church prefers to forget that \nearly churches of Mary were staffed by priestesses, not priests. 65 \n\nAbove all, Christian authorities feared Mary might be the channel \nthrough which Goddess-worship could reestablish itself, for she \ninspired utterances similar to those the ancient Mother inspired, like \nGoethe\'s: "Supreme and sovereign Mistress of the World! ... Oh \nVirgin, in the highest sense most pure, oh Mother, worthy of all our \nworship, our chosen Queen, equal with the gods." 66 The secret, \nineradicable heresies of Marian worship received graphic form in the \nfamous Vierge Ouvrante Mary as a statue that opened up to show \nGod, Jesus, angels, and saints contained inside her. \n\nIn the generating and nourishing, protective and transformative, feminine \npower of the unconscious, a wisdom is at work that is infinitely superior \nto the wisdom of man \'s waking consciousness, and that, as source of vision \nand symbol, of ritual and law, poetry and vision, intervenes, summoned \nor unsummoned, to save man and give direction to his life. \n\nThis feminine-maternal wisdom is no abstract, disinterested knowl- \nedge, but a wisdom of loving participation. . . . In the patriarchal \ndevelopment of the Judeo-Christian West, with its masculine, monotheis- \ntic trend toward abstraction, the goddess, as a feminine figure of \nwisdom, was disenthroned and repressed. She survived only secretly, for \nthe most part in heretical and revolutionary bypaths. . . . \n\nSeen from the outside, the "Vierge Ouvrante" is the familiar and \nunassuming mother with child. But when opened she reveals the \nheretical secret within her. God the Father and God the Son, usually \nrepresented as heavenly lords who in an act of pure grace raise up the \nhumble, earth-bound mother to abide with them, prove to be contained in \nher; prove to be the "contents" of her all-sheltering body. 67 \nMary represented the second of the two expedients men used to \novercome their fear of women, according to Homey: disparagement \nand idealization. 68 But she was so ideal that she had to be apotheo- \nsized just as unmistakably as Jesus himself. So she rose bodily from the \nearth and ascended to glory. Unfortunately, those who formulated \nthis idea were quite ignorant of the vastness of the universe, and their \nsimplistic "rising to the sky" no longer serves an age in which such \ninformation is readily available. Even assuming that Mary\'s body could \ntravel at the speed of light an impossible idea to begin with it \nwould be only two thousand light-years away at the present time, about \n\n\n\n610 \n\n\n\nftM i \n\n\n\none-fiftieth of the distance across our own galaxy, let alone plunged Mary \n\ninto the unthinkable immensity of intergalactic space. And yet in an era \n\nwhen the absurdity of the idea is perfectly plain to the educated, to be ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nexact on June 30, 1968, the Credo of Pope Paul VI reconfirmed the \n\ndogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary though God \n\napparently didn\'t take the trouble to inform him about the method of its \n\naccompl ish ment. 69 \n\nBut not all minds in the modern age are modern minds. Many \nremain ignorant of what has been discovered about the physical \nuniverse. Many are ignorant of the theories and doctrines professed by \ntheir own religion. They worship Mary only because their inner \nbeing demands a mother-archetype, and she is the only one presented \nto them. They don\'t know how many "Marys" there were before \nChristianity. But educated churchmen know. Canon John de Satge \nwrote: "The evangelical has a strong suspicion that the deepest roots \nof the Marian cultus are not to be found in the Christian tradition at all. \nThe religious history of mankind shows a recurring tendency to \nworship a mother-goddess. . . . May it not be the case, the evangelical \nwonders, that what we have here is in reality an older religion, a \npaganism which has been too lightly baptized into Christ and whose \nancient features persist under a thin Christian veil?" 70 \n\nHowever, Mary wasn\'t "lightly" adopted by Christianity. She was \nopposed, attacked, and finally accepted only with many theological \nmisgivings and restrictions. Early Gospels that dwelt on the divinity of \nMary were labeled "poisonous" by the orthodox church. 71 Christian \nmystics who coveted the female role and spoke of "becoming Mary and \nbearing God from within," did so in defiance of the church\'s earlier \nedict that Mary couldn\'t claim the title of Theotokos (God-bearer), \nbecause God couldn\'t be born of a mortal woman. 72 The edict was \nabandoned after several centuries only because Christians wished to \nemulate the pagan Mystery-cults whose Savior-gods were invariably \nborn of mortal virgins. (See Virgin Birth.) \n\nChristian art of the first five centuries showed Mary in a position \nlower than Jesus, even lower than the Magi, who wore haloes while \nshe wore none. In the 6th century she acquired a halo and rose to the \ncentral position in a group of non-haloed apostles. By the 9th century \nshe reigned as Queen of Heaven in the middle of the apse in two \ncathedrals. 73 \n\nBy the 14th century, Wyclif was writing: "It seems to me \nimpossible that we should obtain the reward without the help of Mary. \nThere is no sex or age, no rank or position, of anyone in the whole \nhuman race, which has no need to call for the help of the Holy Virgin." \nThe Te Deum Laudamus declared, "All the earth doth worship \nthee, Spouse of the Eternal Father." 74 \n\nWhen Mary appeared in a subordinate position, it was in the role \nf Daughter like the Virgin Kore on the lap of the Elder Goddess \n\n\n\no \n\n\n\n611 \n\n\n\nMary represented by "God\'s grandmother," the ancient Anna (St. Anne, \n\ncalled Mary\'s mother). In some painted or sculpted groupings, the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ two Goddesses and the male infant seem to form a trinity quite \n\nexclusive of God. 75 An observer might be reminded of the Egyptian \ngod-king on the laps of his Two Mothers, they who would nurse him \nforever and thus give him eternal life. The mythical history of St. \nAnne reveals that she, even more directly than Mary, descended from \nthe image of that fertile Creatress, Mother Earth. 76 \n\nLegends and images of Mary exerted an uncanny appeal even in \nthe "scientific" modern age with its professed skepticism about the \nsupernatural. In 1945, a young boy named Joseph Vitolo was greatly \nimpressed by the film Song of Bernadette, and subsequently conjured \nup a vision of the Virgin for himself. He conversed with her for sixteen \nconsecutive nights at a certain rock in the Bronx. She told him to \nhave a chapel built on the spot, and promised the appearance of a \nhealing spring within a short time. \n\nThough the site received the popular name of the Bronx Lourdes, \nand credulous folk hurried there in astonishing numbers to pray for \nmiraculous cures, the spring never appeared. Eventually, young Joseph \nbecame embarrassed by the fuss he had caused. He then said the \nVirgin told him she wouldn\'t come any more to that place. Despite this \ndisappointment, for many years the faithful continued to gather and \ndig in the mud, seeking the holy spring. 77 \n\nBut it was not only the simple-minded who sought help from \nMary. Historian Henry Adams thought Christianity\'s divine mother, \nhowever attenuated, offered the only hope of spiritual comfort in an \nalienated technological society. He saw that "the males of his society, \nwho had transferred so many of their once autonomous activities to \nmachines and automatons, did not have sufficient life-sense to save \nthe race. In their blind pride over their scientific facilities, they would \ncling to the insensate mechanisms they had created, making them go \nfaster and faster, though incapable of applying the brakes. . . . Henry \nAdams, at the end of his own career, turned to another countervailing \nform of energy, the energy of life, the energy of erotic love, reproduc- \ntion, and creation; he sought a counterpoise to chaos by invoking \nwoman\'s faith in her own creativity, in all the ramifying, formative \nprocesses of life, above all those of sex, love, and motherhood." In a \npoetic address to the Virgin he said: "I feel the energy of faith, not in \nthe future science but in you." 78 \n\nOnce more it seemed that God (or man) depended on his Mother \n(or woman) to straighten up the mess he had made, even if it meant \nceding supreme power to her. An 1 8th-century theologian wrote, "At \nthe command of Mary all obey, even God." Today it is widely \nrecognized even by laymen that "two rivers of common source, Mary \nand Maya, the Virgin and Shakti, once again run into one: and the \n\n\n\n612 \n\n\n\nidess is once more, as she ever was, the creatrix of the universe, the Mary Magdalene \n\nself-revealing energy of the unknowable God." 79 \n\n\n\n1.

Therefore medieval traditions concern- \ning Mary Magdalene hark back to her early mystical supremacy. She \nwas called Mary Lucifer, "Mary the Light-giver." It was said Jesus \nraised Lazarus from the dead solely for love of her. "There was no \ngrace that He refused her, nor any mark of affection that He withheld \nfrom her." 5 \n\nThe Pistis Sophia made Mary Magdalene the questioner of Jesus, Pistis Sophia (Faith- \n\nin the Oriental manner of the catechism applied to the god by his Wisdom) A Gnostic \n\nShakti or Devi (Goddess). The female questioner then was addressed as scr \'P^e of the 3rd \n\nccnturv a O trcinsritccl \n"Dearly Beloved." 4 Jesus used the same form of address, though later from q^i^ \n\neditors eliminated all traces of the identity of his questioner; but it was Coptic, setting forth the \n\napparent that his "dearly beloved" was Mary Magdalene. 5 teachings of Jesus \n\nOrigen showed a mystic devotion to Mary Magdalene, confusing u P on his return to earth, \n\nher with the Goddess by calling her "the mother of all of us," and ] 2 y ears after his \n\n1 <* resurrection. \n\n\n\n613 \n\n\n\nMary Magdalene \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, \nexerting a powerful \ninfluence on the \nearly Greek church. At \nfirst he was \naccounted a saint, but \nthree centuries after \nhis death he was \ndeclared a heretic \nbecause of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\nGospel of Mary \n\nOne of the early \nGnostic Gospels, \nonce included with the \nbooks of the New \nTestament but later \neliminated from the \ncanon. A copy was \nrediscovered in the \n1940s at Nag Hammadi. \n\n\n\nsometimes Jerusalem, and sometimes The Church (Ecclesia, another \ntitle of the Virgin). Origen claimed Mary Magdalene was immortal, \nhaving lived from the beginning of time. 6 \n\nThus it seems Mary the Whore was only another form of Mary \nthe Virgin, otherwise the Triple Goddess Mari-Anna-Ishtar, the \nGreat Whore of Babylon who was worshipped along with her savior-son \nin the Jerusalem temple. 7 The Gospel of Mary said all three Marys of \nthe canonical books were one and the same. 8 \n\nIndeed, the Virgin and Whore were still confused with one \nanother in the 7th century a.d. when, on the day of the Nativity of \nthe Blessed Virgin, Pope Sergius instituted an annual procession to the \nold temple of the prostitute-goddess Libera, changing the temple\'s \nname to Santa Maria Maggiore: Most-Great Holy Mary. 9 It was not \nmade clear which Holy Mary was meant. A Gnostic poem merged \nthe two of them as a primal feminine power: "I am the first and the last. \nI am the honored one and the scorned one. I am the whore, and the \nholy one." 10 \n\nMagdalene means "she of the temple-tower." The Jerusalem \ntemple had a triple tower representing the triple deity, one tower \nbearing the name of the queen, Mariamne, an earthly incarnation of the \nGoddess Mari. 11 This was the same Mariamne, Miriam, or Mary \nwho took Joseph for her lover. 12 Priestesses of this temple apparently \nsubsidized Jesus and his companions, according to Luke 8:1-3, \nwhich says Jesus and "the twelve" were financially supported by Mary \nMagdalene and a group of women. Latin texts say the women \nprovided for "him" (Jesus), but Greek texts make it "them." n \n\nThe seven "devils" exorcised from Mary Magdalene seem to have \nbeen the seven Maskim, or Anunnaki, Sumero-Akkadian spirits of \nthe seven nether spheres, born of the Goddess Mari. Their multiple \nbirth was represented in her sacred dramas, which may account for \ntheir alleged emergence from Mary Magdalene. An Akkadian tablet \nsaid of them: "They are seven! In the depths of the ocean, they are \nseven! In the brilliancy of the heavens, they are seven! They proceed \nfrom the ocean depths [Maria], from the hidden retreat." H \n\nThe Gospels say no men attended Jesus\'s tomb, but only Mary j \nMagdalene and her women. Only women announced Jesus\'s resur- \nrection. This was because men were barred from the central mysteries \nof the Goddess. Priestesses announced the successful conclusion of \nthe rites, and the Savior\'s resurrection. The Bible says the male apostles \nknew nothing of Jesus\'s resurrection, and had to take the women\'s \nword for it (Luke 24:10-1 1). The apostles were ignorant of the sacred \ntradition and didn\'t even realize a resurrection was expected: "They \nknew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead" \n(John 20:9). \n\nMari-Ishtar the Great Whore anointed or christ-ened her \ndoomed god when he went into the underworld, whence he would \n\n\n\n614 \n\n\n\nrise again at her bidding. That is, she made him a Christ. Her priestess Mary Magdalene \n\nraised the lament for him when he died in the flesh, as a sacrificial \n\nvictim. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, victims were told: "The harlot who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nanointed you with fragrant oil laments for you now." 15 Temple- \nwomen of Jerusalem raised the same lament for Tammuz (Ezekiel \n8:14), with whom Jesus was identified. Jesus himself said Mary \nMagdalene anointed him for his burial, pouring a precious unguent on \nhis head in the time-honored manner of the sacred king\'s crowning \n(Matthew 26:7-12). The christening-vase of holy oil was the ubiquitous \nsymbol of Mary Magdalene in Christian art though the virgin Mary \nalso bore the harlot\'s title of Holy Vase. 16 See Jesus Ben Pandera. \n\nVirgin and Whore constantly exchanged attributes through the \nMiddle Ages; the virgin Mary was consistently a special patron of \nprostitutes. 17 A Christian magic ring, now in the London museum, \nbears the legend, "Holy Mary Magdalene pray for me." 18 \n\nPope Julius II by a papal bull established a "sacred" brothel in \nRome, which flourished under his successors Leo X and Clement \nVII. The earnings of this brothel supported the Holy Sisters of the \nOrder of St. Mary Magdalene, indicating that the Holy Sisters and \nthe magdalenes (whores) were one and the same. Pope Innocent III \nalso favored Rome\'s collegia of prostitutes, called virgines, "unmar- \nried women." He publicly announced that any man who married one of \nthem would be specially praised in heaven. 19 \n\nMuch Christian myth-making went into the later history of Mary \nMagdalene. She was said to have lived for a while with the virgin \nMary at Ephesus. This story probably was invented to account for the \nname Maria associated with the Ephesian Goddess. Afterward, Mary \nMagdalene went to Marseilles, another town named after the ancient \nsea-mother Mari. Her cult centered there. Bones were found at \nVezelay and declared to be hers. Her dwelling was a cave formerly \nsacred to the pagans, at St. Baume (Holy Tree). 20 For thirty years she \nlived there without eating or drinking, her only nourishment the sweet \nsongs of the angels, a "delightful repast" she daily took in through her \nears. 21 A church was built over her grotto. Local winegrowers still offer \nvotive candles to her for a good vintage, as if the ancient fertility- \nmother still occupied the site. 22 \n\nSt. Martha accompanied Mary to Provence and worked a number \nof miracles there. Meeting a dragon named Tarasque (i.e., the Celtic \ndeity Taranis), Martha destroyed him by tying him up with her girdle \nand pouring holy water on his head. 23 Old images of the Twofold \nGoddess with her Great Serpent seem to have been renamed Mary and \nMartha. More often, Mary appeared as the typical feminine trinity \nruling birth, love, and death. As Holy Mary at the Cradle, she was the \nmidwife (or birth-goddess) who delivered Jesus. 24 As harlot and \nfunerary priestess she was linked with sex and death. Finally there was \nthe Gnostic suggestion that she was the original "pope," foundress of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n615 \n\n\n\nMascot Christ\'s church, according to the Oriental idea that spiritual authority \n\nMashya and Mashyoi must pass from male to female and vice versa (see Peter, Saint). \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Some said she married St. John the Evangelist. 25 In 1 2th-century Milan \nthey were worshipped together in a dual cathedral built and adminis- \ntered by the monks of St. John jointly with the virgines of St. Maria \nMaggiore, also entitled Sancta Dei Genetrix (Holy Mother of God). \nThe androgynous cathedral was excavated in 1943-44, but its discovery \nwas kept secret. 26 \n\nDuring the 1 3th century a Dianic temple was rededicated to Mary \nMagdalene. At Easter, the story of her conversion of the rulers of \nMarseilles was chanted at the altar. Later the sacred song was sup- \npressed. Later still, Mary\'s devotees were forbidden to hold mass. In \n1781, the Magdalene temple was demolished. 27 \n\nl.Pagels,22,64. 2. Malvern, 47-49. 3. de Voragine, 355. \n\n4. Mahanirvanatantra, 173. 5. Malvern, 12. 6. Malvern, 60. 7.

God \n\n\n\n616 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ahura Mazda) told them not to listen to the lies of the devil Mask \n\n(Ahriman).

Lamusse, 319. 2. Legge 1, 183. \n\n\n\nMask \n\nIt is a commonplace of primitive religion that deity resides in a sacred \nmask. A wearer of the mask is possessed by the spirit. He or she is the \nGod or Goddess, at least for participation in the sacred drama or \nprocession. Paleolithic rock drawings show divine creatures as human \nbeings wearing the masks of animals. Egyptian animal-headed deities \nwere obviously human beings wearing elaborate animal heads. 1 Modern \nAfricans, Melanesians, Australians, and many others maintain the \nsame belief. A witch doctor in a lion mask "isn\'t pretending to be a lion; \nhe is convinced that he is a lion. . . . [H]e shares a \'psychic identity\' \nwith the animal." 2 Similarly in pre-Christian Europe, anyone wearing \nthe mask or headdress of a god would become the god or, as \nChristians put it, would be possessed by the devil. \n\nThe word mask occurs in many Indo-European languages and \nmight be traced to the maskim of Sumer and Akkad: spirits of the \nnether spheres, or ancestral ghosts. Initiated Sufi magicians of the \nMiddle Ages wore spirit masks and became maskhara, "revelers," at \ntheir sabbats; this probably gave rise to the French designation of a \nmystery play as a masque} \n\nThe Scandinavian word for a mask was grim} This word was often \na component of gods\' names, like Grimnir (Masked One, a title of \nOdin). 5 In some legends the mask became a magic helmet that gave \nadmission to the spirit world. The most famous magic helmet was \ncalled Hildegrim, or Helkappe, or Tarnkappe, or Cap of Darkness. It \nwas given by Mother Hel (Hilde) to her favored heroes. It made \nthem invisible so they could enter the rose gardens of paradise as if they \nwere dead, yet return alive to the earth. The wearer of the mask \nbecame like the Lord of Death, able to reincarnate himself. \n\nThe Book of Heroes and the Wilkina saga named Hel\'s perennial \nconsort Grim. He lived with the Goddess in her secret cave until \nanother hero came to challenge and kill him and inherit the mask. 6 \nSome said this magic Helkappe was made of dog skin, since dogs \nwere sacred to the death-goddess, and it was the same mask worn by \nHades, the Lord of Death. 7 \n\nIn medieval France the same Lord of Death was Macabre, the \n\n\n\n617 \n\n\n\nMass \nMater \n\n\n\nGrim Reaper that is, the masked reaper, wielding his scythe as a \nreaper of souls. He performed the danse macabre, Dance of Death, in \nthe mystery plays and folk festivals so frequently featured in medieval \nart. Like Dancing Shiva in Kali\'s cosmic yoni, Macabre reminded his \naudience that the dance of life is also a dance of death; that the two \nare mutually dependent, neither possible without the other. 8 Tibetan \nmystery plays still present the death-masquerader in his skull mask \nand skeleton costume. 9 Evans-Wentz said medieval mystery plays \ncontained "symbolism so much akin to that found in mystery plays \nstill flourishing under ecclesiastical patronage throughout Tibet and the \nneighboring territories of Northern Buddhism as to point to another \nstream of Orientalism having come into Europe." 10 \n\nAnimal-headed deities of Egypt and the Middle East also found \nnew incarnations in medieval mystery plays, some of which may have \nbeen rooted in Neolithic rites when sacred dancers wore the heads of \nsacrificed beasts. At the ineradicably popular Carnival, "Mummers \nwent about dressed as various kinds of beasts, probably a remnant of \nsome seasonal festival of native gods, Gaulish or other, for in Gaul at \nall events gods often were represented under forms other than \nhuman." 11 \n\nPagan mask-wearing at religious festivals continued in the secular \nCarnival. After having denounced it as unlawful for many centuries, \nthe church finally capitulated and declared it "lawful" to wear masks in \nCarnival season. 12 However, the word masca remained one of the \nchurch\'s official words for a witch. 15 \n\n1.

Wilkins, 20 1 . 2. Upanishads, 53. \n\n\n\nMatrilineal Inheritance \n\nDuring the Neolithic age, the matrilineal clan system and the rule of \nmother-right were followed almost everywhere. Early writings from \nEgypt depict the woman in complete control of herself and her \nhome, with property descending from mother to daughter. The most \nsignificant revolution in Greece was the transition from matrilineal to \npatrilineal succession and the resulting destruction of clan loyalties. In \nmany other areas, the matrilineal system survived to a late date. The \nVenerable Bede mentioned rules of matrilineal succession still existing \nin parts of the British Isles up to the 9th century. 1 \n\nMatrilineal inheritance was the rule among British tribes until the \ncoming of Christianity. The Picts inherited all property, even "king- \ndoms," through the female line. 2 With the coming of Christianity, the \nold laws of mother-right began to decline. Sixth-century England still \nhad laws of equal inheritance, but a wife who decided to leave her \nhusband could carry off half the property and all the children. Later \nin the Christian era, the wife was deprived of everything. The English \n"heir" came from heres, cognate with the Greek word for a female \nlandowner, here or "Hera." The Magna Carta referred to a here as a \nperson of either sex. Later church laws listed heres as exclusively \nmale. 3 \n\nAmong pagan Celts, men bequeathed nothing to their children; \ntheir possessions were inherited by their sisters or their sisters\' \nchildren. According to old laws of Burgundy and Thuringia, property \npassed only in the female line. 4 Charlemagne opposed marriage for \nhis daughters, because under old Frankish laws of matrilineal inheri- \ntance this would have meant division of his kingdom. 5 \n\nIn pre-Roman Latium a landholding was called latifundia, founded \nby the Goddess Lat, after whom the country was named; thus each \nparcel of land belonged originally to a matriarch. 6 Even in the later \nRoman empire, husbands had no legal claim on their wives\' land or \npossessions as long as the wife was careful to spend three consecutive \nnights each year away from home. 7 This was a remnant of an earlier \ncustom like that of pre-Islamic Arabs, whereby a wife divorced her \nhusband by shutting him out of the home for three consecutive \nnights. 8 \n\nIn Greece, a parcel of property was temenos, "land belonging to \n\n\n\n620 \n\n\n\nt : moon," i.e., to woman. 9 This came to mean specifically the land \nrounding a temple of the Goddess. 10 In primitive times however, \nfcry matriarch\'s hearth was a temple of the Goddess. The popula- \nin and land unit in Attica was a demos, derived from De that is, the \nxldess De-Mother, or Demeter. 11 Chieftains ruled only through \nrriage with the resident matriarch. Harking back to this same system \nIndia, the Mahabharata says the leading attributes of a queen were \nh intelligence, sacred knowledge, and property. 12 \n\nIn most ancient societies, young men went forth from their \nMternal homes to seek their fortune elsewhere, because their sisters \nmerited the family home. It was a fixed habit of Greek men, and also \nthe pagan heroes depicted in fairy tales, to leave home and seek a \ntrilocal marriage with an heiress in a distant land. 13 \n\n"Matrimony" used to mean the feminine equivalent of "patrimo- \n| : inheritance of property, in the maternal line. Matrimony came \nbe synonymous with marriage only because marriage was a way for \nIn to gain control of property. \n\nIn Lydia, women owned the land, governed the communities, and \n|>k the initiative in love affairs. 14 The same was true in Egypt. \nInheritance passed through the mother rather than through the fa- \nftr," says Professor Gordon. "This system may well hark back to \nehistoric times when only the obvious relationship between mother \nad child was recognized, but not the less apparent relationship \nween father and child." For many centuries, patriarchal marriages in \nlypt existed side by side with old-style matriarchal unions, initiated \nthe wife and terminated by her will alone. 15 Since daughters, not \nIns, inherited property, it was the duty of an Egyptian daughter (not \n1) to care for aged parents. 16 \n\nMale scholars have been reluctant to describe ancient systems of \ntrilineal inheritance. After translation of early Babylonian texts, \n\nI Boscawen wrote, "The freedom granted [my italics] to women in \nibylonia allowed them to hold and manage their own estates. . . . \nfjhe mother here is always represented by a sign which means \nfcddess of the house.\'" 17 The implication was that women held \nA-ir property only through men\'s lenience, which was not the case, \nlbmen held property by the ironclad law of mother-right, and a \nIbylonian wife had the same title as a matriarch in India, grhadevata, \nflouse-Goddess." \n\nEven Mohammed, a leading opponent of matriarchal principles, \nftas enabled to carry out his mission thanks only to the wealth which \nacquired from his first wife Khadija, who was engaged in lucrative \nBBc and owned landed estates." 18 \n\nLanded property developed in the hands of women because \nmen were the first to farm the land, thereby establishing ownership \nlit. Some primitives still believe only the life-magic inherent in women \n\nII make plants grow: "Women know how to bring forth, and how \nInake the seed bring forth; men don\'t understand these things." 19 \n\n\n\nMatrilineal Inheritance \n\n\n\nMahabharata \n\nIndian epic poem, \nconsisting of historical \nand legendary \nmaterial gathered \nbetween the 4th and \n10th centuries a.d., \nincluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n621 \n\n\n\nMatrilineal Inheritance Amerindians universally attributed the invention of agriculture to \n\nwomen, sole owners of the cultivated fields. Matrilocal marriage and \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ matrilineal ownership of the home place were customary among the \n\nAlgonquin, Sioux, Seneca, Pawnee, Seminole, Kiowa, and Cree tribes. \nAs in ancient Greece, fathers were "strangers" in the clan. Women \nwere "mistresses of the soil." 20 "The women were the great power \n\namong the clans as everywhere else [T]he original nomination of \n\nthe chiefs always rested with them/\' 21 When the Iroquois conveyed \nlands to the U.S. government, documents had to be marked by their \nwomen, because the marks of men had no validity among the tribes. 22 \nPayuga women owned everything, as one missionary found to his \nastonishment: "If the husband gives his wife any cause, real or \nfancied, of offense, she packs up the tent and its furniture, appropriates \neven the canoe, and takes everything away; the children follow her, \nand the husband and father is left with the clothes he stands in and his \nweapons as his only possession." 23 The laws of this missionary\'s \nhomeland insisted on the contrary: a divorced husband retained every- \nthing including the children, the wife having no legal right even to \nher clothes. Hence, the missionaries\' surprise at Indian customs and \ntheir expectation of men\'s resentment. Yet Indian men didn\'t resent \nthe prerogatives of mother-right. They considered the mother\'s author- \nity natural, as Christians considered the father\'s authority natural. \nIndian husbands were known to take forty- or fifty-mile hikes only to \nprocure some special food craved by a pregnant wife. 24 \n\nIn Africa, women owned the land and other property connected \nwith the home place, and transmitted ownership to their daughters or i \ntheir brothers\' daughters. European governments and missions in Africa \nloosed a torrent of propaganda against matrilineal customs among the \nnatives. In most African nations, European land reforms consisted of \ntaking land away from the women and allocating it to their hus- \nbands. 25 This tended to make the women paupers and destroy their \nself-respect, as the tribes looked down on a woman who couldn\'t \nsupport her children. \n\nPatriarchal religious authorities everywhere changed ancient sys- I \nterns of matrilineal inheritance to put property in the hands of men. \nMedieval Christian kings commonly endowed their barons with the \nphrase, "Take that woman and her fief." 26 The early centuries of the \nChristian conquest of Europe were largely occupied with acquisition of \' \nlands from the pagan women. The monastic Order of Teutonic \nKnights got the island of Mainau from its owner, the Fair Maid of \nMainau, on condition that her lover be made head of the order. 27 \n\nThe Bible contains traces of former matrilineal inheritance and \nmatrilocal marriage, e.g., a man shall "leave his father and his \nmother, and cleave unto his wife" (Genesis 2:24). Naomi told her \ndaughters-in-law to "return each to her mother\'s house" (Ruth 1:8) \nbecause houses were owned by mothers, not fathers. A marriage \nagreement permitting removal of a woman from her maternal home \n\n\n\n622 \n\n\n\nwas a violation of ancient laws. Therefore Abraham, seeking a bride for Matrilineal Inheritance \nhis son, had to give many gifts to the bride, to her mother, and to her \n\nbrother (not to her father) as compensation for taking her away from her ^^^^^^^^^^^ \niiome (Genesis 24:53). \n\nRetention of property in the hands of a patrilineal clan was the \npurpose of the so-called Levirate marriage commanded by God \n(Deuteronomy 25:5). If a man died, his brother must marry the widow \nrather than allow her to take her property and depart from the family. \n[This rule dated from an early era when nomadic Israelites began to \nacquire lands and possessions by intermarrying with pagan women of \nCanaan, Moab, Phoenicia, etc. Modern laws play the same trick on \n|women. If a husband and wife die together in an accident, it is \n(assumed that the wife dies first, so the man\'s family will inherit. 28 \n\nPeople who maintained the matrilocal marriage tradition, like the \nAmerican Indians, developed no wedding laments, mock battles, \npseudo-kidnappings, or displays of coyness. 29 But in patrilocal marriages, \njthe bride\'s relatives usually put on a show of resistance. Matrilocal \nmarriage appeared in the Norse myth of Ragnar Lodbrok (Leather- \nbreeches), who married a foreign warrior-princess, but could not \ninduce her to leave her own country. When he wished to return to his \nhomeland, he was forced to leave her behind. 30 \n\nEven the peripatetic gypsies had matrilocal marriage traditions. In \ngypsy folklore, heroines never left their maternal homes. After death \npey were buried under the family threshold a custom of the early \nHindus, the gypsies\' forebears. 31 \n\nThe aim of European Christianity was acquisition of property, \nWhich meant overturning pagan systems of matrilineal inheritance. \nBy forcible seizure and warfare, the church managed to acquire fully a \nfthird of all the landed property on the continent by the early Middle \nAges. 32 The rest was more difficult. In some parts of Europe up to 1200 \nU.D., women were still listed as the landowners, and men identified \nthemselves by their mothers\' clan names. Until the 10th century, priests \nmarried to gain property, claiming that without their wives they \nwould succumb to "hunger and nakedness." Church laws revised the \nJjystem; then a series of papal decretals between 103 1 and 105 1 \nprdered priests to abandon their wives and sell their children into \nklavery. 33 Naturally, the property and monies thus acquired by a priest \nwould revert to the church upon his death, since he no longer had legal \nheirs. \n\nThe legal/ecclesiastical war on female property ownership went on \nIcentury after century, until women were so hamstrung by the laws of \nCod and man that they had almost nothing left that they could call their \nown. By the end of the 19th century, English wives could not \nadminister their own property even if they had any, nor make a will \ndisposing of it, without their husbands\' consent. 34 As late as 1930 in \nFrance, a woman was forbidden to do any business with a bank, not \neven to make small deposits, without her husband\'s permission. 35 Up \n\n\n\n623 \n\n\n\nMatronalia \nMay \n\n\n\nto the present time, lack of control over money and property is still the \ngreatest obstacle for women who wish to take their children and leave \nabusive or violent husbands. In this respect the centuries of patriarchal \neffort achieved their goal. \n\nI. Stone, 15, 37, 52; Boulding, 318. 2. Johnson, 157. 3. Beard, 194, 199-200. \n4.

The women\'s subsequent period of asceticism \nand fasting up to the festival of Ceres in April was the forerunner of the \nChristian fast of Lent. 1 Rites of the Matronalia were kept secret from \nmen and remain obscure to this day, though their purpose undoubtedly \nwas to make the Earth Mother ready for springtime regeneration. \n\nl.Gaster,645. \n\n\n\nIn Scandinavia, May \nwas dedicated to Maj, \nthe Virgin, either Mary \nor the pagans\' Virgin \nMother, interchange- \nably. In Saxon England \nthe month was called \nSproutkale: the sprout- \ning time of virgin- \nmother Earth with her \narchaic Aryan name of \nKale, Kelle, or Kali. \nAnother name for the \nmonth was Tri-Milchi, \nimprobably derived by \nthe Venerable Bede \nfrom a theory that the \nSaxon cows gave milk \nthree times a day in \nMay. 8 Alternatively, \nit meant the Triple \nGoddess\'s appearance \nin the form of three \n\n\n\nMay \n\nThe month of Maya or Maia, the Virgin Goddess of Spring; in \nnorthern Europe, Maj or Mai, the Maiden. 1 This was the traditional \nmonth of "wearing of the green" in honor of the Earth Mother\'s new \ngarment, and of fornicating in plowed fields to encourage the crops. \nMay was a "honey-moon" of sexual freedom throughout rural \nEurope up to the 16th century. 2 Marriage bonds were temporarily in \nabeyance. The maxim that "only bad women" marry in the month of \nMay probably was a relic of earlier taboos on all marriages during the \nmonth of license. 3 \n\nYet there were traces of a divine marriage ritual in the "May \nriding," when knights and ladies rode in pairs into the wood, led by \nthe Queen of the May on a white horse and her male companion on a \ndark one. They impersonated Frey and Freya, "the Lord" and "the \nLady" whose union made fertility magic each spring. 4 \n\nMay Eve was the great springtime festival of "witches," corre- \nsponding to Halloween at the opposite pole of the year. May Eve was \nknown in Germany as Walpurgisnacht, in Ireland and Scotland as \nBeltaine or Baltein, when the god Baal, Bel, or Balder was burned in \neffigy. Sometimes a man chosen by lot represented him, and leaped \nthrough the May fires still called "Balder\'s balefires" in rural Scandi- \n\n\n\n624 \n\n\n\nBavia. 5 Clearly, these were customs dating back to real burning of the May \n\npan who represented the god in his love-death (Liebestod). \n\nThe May King of medieval romance inherited the customs of ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nDiana\'s sacred kings. He won the "queen of a magic wood" (the \nIpoddess) by combat with her previous king on the festival of Ascension \nDay in May. Le Chevalier de la Charrette named him Meleagant, \njlrince of the land of no return (he was a Lord of Death). Le Morte \nWArthur corrupted his name to "Mellyagaunce," a lascivious May \npng who became the ritual lover of Queen Guinevere and led the \nlexual games of May Day. 6 A 1 5th-century poet identified the same \nMay King with Christ, who was like the Holy Rose of May: "the red \nlower that Mary bore." 7 \n\nThe god\'s phallus was planted in the earth\'s womb in the guise of \nhe Maypole, which was not originally European but a direct borrow- \nng from India where the Maypole is still "the great lingam." 9 In \n6th-century England its phallic symbolism was understood perfectly \nveil, as shown by the diatribe of the Puritan writer Philip Stubbes: \n\nYoung men and maids, old men and wives, run gadding overnight to the \nwoods, groves, hills, and mountains, where they spend all night in \npleasant pastimes; and in the morning they return, bringing with them \nbirch and branches of trees, to deck their assemblies withal. And no \nmarvel, for there is a great Lord present amongst them, as superintendent \nand Lord over their pastimes and sports; namely, Satan, prince of hell. \nBut the chiefest jewel they bring from thence is their May-pole, which \nthey bring home with great veneration, as thus. They have twenty or \nforty yoke of oxen, every ox having a sweet nose-gay of flowers placed on \nthe tip of his horns, and these oxen draw home this May-pole (this \nstinking idol, rather) which is covered all over with flowers and herbs, \nbound round about with strings, from the top to the bottom, and \nsometimes painted with variable colors, with two or three hundred men, \nwomen and children following it with great devotion. And this being \nreared up, with handkerchiefs and flags hovering on the top, they strew \nthe ground round about, bind green boughs about it, set up summer \nhalls, bowers, and arbors hard by it. And then fall they to dance about it, \nlike as the heathen people did at the dedication of Idols, whereof this is \na perfect pattern, or rather the thing itself. w \n\nYoung men and maids went into the woods, and few returned \nme "undefiled," as the observer said. According to Spelman, the \nic fellows and their girl friends fell "into ditches upon one \nnother," for the odd reason that they were "enveloped with a mist of \nwandering out of their ways." Douce had no doubt of the festival\'s \n>agan origin: "The Queen of the May is the legitimate representative of \nhe Goddess Flora in the Roman Festival." n Stuckeley described \nday celebrations in 1 724: \n\nThere is a May Pole near Horn Castle, Lincolnshire, where probably \nstood an Hermes (herm, phallic pillar) in Roman times. The boys \nannually keep up the festival of the Floralia on May Day, making a \nprocession to this hill with May gads (as they call them) in their hands. \n\n\n\n625 \n\n\n\nMaya This is a white willow wand, the bark peeled off, tied round with cowslips, \n\na thyrsus of the Bacchanals. At night they have a bonehre, and other \nmerriment, which is really a sacrifice, a religious festival. \' 2 \n\nNaturally the church was opposed to this religious festival. \nBishop Eligius of Noyons begged his converts in the 7th century to stop \nobserving the sexual rites of May without success. 15 A thousand \nyears later the month was still given over to "witches." Church bells in \n1 7-century Treves were rung all night throughout the month of \nMay, to "protect the city from flying witches." H \n\nThere were a few voices raised against ecclesiastical restrictions on \nthe activities of the Merry Month. William Fennor\'s Pasquil\'s Palino- \ndia (\\6\\9) lamented the new puritanical laws against the rites of May: \n\nWhen no capricious constables disturb them, \n\nNor justice of the peace did seek to curb them, \n\nNor peevish puritan, in railing sort, \n\nNor over-wise church-warden, spoiled the sport, \n\nHappy the age, and harmless were the days \n\n(For then true love and amity were found), \n\nWhen every village did a Maypole raise, \n\nAnd Witson-ales and May-games did abound . . . \n\nBut since the Summer poles were over-thrown, \n\nAnd all good sports and merriments decay\'d, \n\nHow times and men are chang\'d, so well is known, \n\nIt were but labor lost if more were said. \n\nAlas, poor May Poles; what should be the cause \n\nThat you were almost banish \'d from the earth ? \n\nWho never were rebellious to the laws; \n\nYour greatest crime was harmless, honest mirth . . . \n\nSome fiery, zealous brother, full of spleen, \n\nThat all the world in his deep wisdom scorns, \n\nCould not endure the May-pole should be seen \n\nTo wear a cox-comb higher than his horns: \n\nHe took it for an idol, and the feast \n\nFor sacrifice unto that painted beast.\' 5 \n\n1.

She \nalso gave birth to the Enlightened One, Buddha. 1 \n\nThe same Goddess, called Maia by the Greeks, was the virgin \nmother of Hermes the Enlightened One, who had as many reincar- \nnations as the Buddha. Sometimes Maia\'s partner was Volcanus (Greek \nHephaestus, the divine smith and fire-god). This was another mythic \n\n\n\n626 \n\n\n\nnating of male fire and female water. 2 Hindus said Agni the fire-god Maya \n\nvas the consort of Kali-Maya, though he was periodically swallowed \n\nlp and "quenched" by her. According to the Tantric phrase, the ^^^^^^ \n\nGoddess quenched a blazing lingam in her yoni. 3 \n\nAs the virgin mother of Buddha, Maya embarrassed ascetic Bud- \nIhists and was soon written out of the script. Like ascetic Christians \npeaking of Christ\'s birth, some Buddhists claimed the Enlightened One \nuld not touch his mother\'s "parts of shame" and so was born \nhrough an opening in her side. This mythic Caesarian section seems to \nlave been bungled, for a few days later Maya died "of joy," as \nJuddhist scriptures rather fatuously put it. 4 \n\nNevertheless, Maya remained very much alive as one of Kali\'s \nnost revered manifestations, because the very fact of "Existence" \nle material cosmos demanded her presence. As Zimmer analyzed \nler: \n\nMaya-Shakti is personified as the world-protecting, feminine, maternal \nside of the Ultimate Being, and as such, stands for the spontaneous, \nloving acceptance of life\'s tangible reality. . . . [S]he affirms, she is, she \nrepresents and enjoys, the delirium of the manifested forms. . . . Maya- \nShakti is Eve, "the Eternal Feminine, " das Ewig- Weibliche: she who ate, \nand tempted her consort to eat, and was herself the apple. From the \npoint of view of the masculine principle of the Spirit (which is in quest of \nthe enduring, eternally valid, and absolutely divine) she is the pre- \neminent enigma. s \n\nIn herself Maya embodied all three aspects of the maternal \nTrinity. Her colors were white, red, and black, the colors of the Gunas, \n>r the Virgin-Mother-Crone. 6 Like every other form of Kali, she was \nCreator, Preserver, Destroyer. She was also a spirit dwelling perpetually \nn women. A Mahayana text says, "Of all the forms of Maya, woman \ns the most important." 7 \n\nMaya\'s son Buddha was surrounded by her symbols. He entered \nlis trance of meditation under her sacred fig tree, which protected \nlim from the weather. On his return from the soul-journey, his first \nymbolic act was to accept a dish of curds from a maiden on Full \nvloon Day in the month of May, the greatest of Buddhist festivals. 8 \n\nNot only the month but many other traditions, names, and \nncepts attest to the great age and wide distribution of the Goddess \nifaya. She was more than the Maia who mothered Hermes; she was \nilso Maga the Grandmother-goddess who bore Cu Chulainn\'s \nnother; and the Mandaean Christians\' Almaya, called "Eternity," or \n\'the World," or "Beings"; and Maga or Maj the May-maiden in \nScandinavia. 9 Like the Hindu Maya who brought forth earthly appear- \ninces at creation, the Scandinavian one personified the pregnant \nvomb of chaos before the beginning: Ginnungagap. In this the World- \nnrgin was associated with the idea of magical illusion, creating \n\'appearances" like her Hindu counterpart. 10 \n\nThis universal Creatress-name may have reached the western \n\n\n\n627 \n\n\n\nMe hemisphere also. The Maya people of Yucatan offered sacrifices in \n\nMedea the same way as in northern India, at the same seasons, determined by \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ the same stars. 1 \' Mayan "scorpion stars" were the same as the \n\nconstellation Scorpio on Hindu and Greek charts. As in India, Mayan \ndivine images were painted blue and Mayan woman pierced the left \nnostril for insertion of a jewel. 12 Another version of the Creatress seems \nto have been the Mother Goddess Mayauel of the Mexican Agave, \ncalled "Woman with Four Hundred Breasts," with a strong resem- \nblance to the world-nurturing Many-Breasted Artemis and other \neastern forms of the deity who mothered all the world\'s creatures. \n\nI.

Like \nMedusa and Metis, she was named from the Sanskrit concept of medha, \n"female wisdom." \' She was a fount of the feminine art of healing, \nand her name was related to "medicine." 2 She could restore the dead to \nlife in her magic cauldron, as shown by the myth of Aeson, who was \nso restored. Pliny called Medea a Goddess whose magic arts could \ncontrol the sun, moon, and stars. 5 She rode in a chariot drawn by \nserpents; it also had wings, to show that she ruled both earth and \nheaven. 4 \n\nAccording to Herodotus, Medea was the Great Goddess of all the \nAryan tribes of Parthia. 5 She was all- wise, and never died, but dwelt \nforever in heaven. 6 \n\n\n\n628 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe seems to have been remembered in Ireland as the Goddess Medusa \n\nMedana, associated with a sacred tree and a regenerative well, whose \n\nwaters were reputed to cure sore eyes. She was artificially canonized as a ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nsaint, and her Christian legend was copied from that of the equally \nbogus St. Lucy. 7 \n\nThe classic story of Medea\'s ill-starred marriage to Jason apparent- \nly was based on a captured idol of the Goddess.

The Argives said Medusa was a Libyan queen beheaded \nby their ancestral hero Perseus, who brought her head (or ceremonial \nmask) back to Athens. 1 \n\nActually, Medusa was the serpent-goddess of the Libyan Ama- \nzons, representing "female wisdom" (Sanskrit medha, Greek metis, \nEgyptian met ox Maat). She was the Destroyer aspect of the Triple \nGoddess called Neith in Egypt, Ath-enna or Athene in North Africa. \nHer inscription at Sais called her "mother of all the gods, whom she \nbore before childbirth existed." She was the past, present, and future: \n"All that has been, that is, and that will be." 2 So famous was this \ndescription of her that Christians later copied it on behalf of Jehovah \n(Revelation 1:8). \n\nShe said: "No mortal has yet been able to lift the veil that covers \nme," because she was Death, and to see her face to face was to die \nthat is, to be "turned to stone" as a funerary statue. She was veiled also \nbecause she was the Future, which always wears a veil. Another \nmeaning of her hidden, dangerous face was the menstrual taboo. \nPrimitive folk often believe the look of a menstruous woman can turn \na man to stone. 3 Medusa had magic blood that could create and destroy \nlife; thus she represented the dreaded life- and death-giving moon- \nblood of women (see Menstrual Blood). 4 \n\nThe Perseus story was invented to account for the appearance of \nMedusa\'s face on Athene\'s aegis, inherited from the pre-Hellenic \nperiod when Athene was actually the same Goddess (also mythologized \nas Metis, her alleged "mother"). The Athenians pretended their \nmunicipal Goddess was the "wisdom" of Zeus, born from his head. But \nolder myths said Athene was born of the Three Queens of Libya \nthat is, the Triple Goddess, of whom Metis-Medusa was the Destroyer \naspect. 5 A female face surrounded by serpent-hair was an ancient, \nwidely recognized symbol of divine female wisdom, and equally of the \n"wise blood" that supposedly gave women their divine powers. \n\n1.

The original \nnscription probably appeared in a language the Hebrew editor didn\'t \n\ni Know, and Daniel\'s speech was loosely interpreted from an old icon \nrepresenting the Moon-goddess as Destroyer, announcing the end of \na king\'s term of office.

Probably a title for the archaic Minerva as the \nmoon, "measurer of Time." \n\n\n\n634 \n\n\n\nenstrual Blood Menstrual Blood \n\nm the earliest human cultures, the mysterious magic of creation \n\nwas thought to reside in the blood women gave forth in apparent mi^m^^^^m \n\nharmony with the moon, and which was sometimes retained in the \n\nwomb to "coagulate" into a baby. Men regarded this blood with holy \n\ndread, as the life-essence, inexplicably shed without pain, wholly \n\nforeign to male experience. \n\nMost words for menstruation also meant such things as incompre- \nhensible, supernatural, sacred, spirit, deity. Like the Latin sacer, old \n\nArabian words for "pure" and "impure" both applied to menstrual \n\nblood and to that only. The Maoris stated explicitly that human souls \n\nare made of menstrual blood, which when retained in the womb \n\n"assumes human form and grows into a man." \' Africans said \n\nmenstrual blood is "congealed to fashion a man." 2 Aristotle said the \n\nsame: human life is made of a "coagulum" of menstrual blood. Pliny \n. icalled menstrual blood "the material substance of generation," capable \n\nof forming "a curd, which afterwards in process of time quickeneth \n\nand groweth to the form of a body." This primitive notion of the \n- ; prenatal function of menstrual blood was still taught in European \n\nI medical schools up to the 18th century. 3 \n\nBasic ideas about menstrual blood came from the Hindu theory \n\nthat as the Great Mother creates, her substance becomes thickened \n\nand forms a curd or clot; solid matter is produced as a "crust." 4 This was \n\nthe way she gave birth to the cosmos, and women employ the same \n\n- method on a smaller scale. According to Daustenius, "The fruit in the \nwomb is nourished only by the mother\'s blood. . . . [T]he menstruum \ndoes not fail the fruit for nourishment, till it at the proper time comes to \nthe light of day." 5 \n\nIndians of South America said all mankind was made of "moon \nblood" in the beginning. 6 The same idea prevailed in ancient \nMesopotamia, where the Great Goddess Ninhursag made mankind out \n... of clay and infused it with her "blood of life." Under her alternate \nnames of Mammetun or Aruru the Great, the Potter, she taught \nwomen to form clay dolls and smear them with menstrual blood as a \nconception-charm, a piece of magic that underlay the name of Adam, \nfrom the feminine adamah, meaning "bloody clay," though scholars \n\n- more delicately translate it "red earth." 7 \n\nThe Bible\'s story of Adam was lifted from an older female-oriented \ncreation myth recounting the creation of man from clay and moon- \nblood. So was the Koran\'s creation story, which said Allah "made man \nout of flowing blood"; but in pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah was the \nGoddess of creation, Al-Lat. 8 The Romans also had traces of the \n01 original creation myth. Plutarch said man was made of earth, but the \npower that made a human body grow was the moon, source of \nmenstrual blood. 9 \n\n\n\n635 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood The lives of the very gods were dependent on the miraculous \n\npower of menstrual blood. In Greece it was euphemistically called \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m the "supernatural red wine" given to the gods by Mother Hera in her \nvirgin form, as Hebe. 10 The root myths of Hinduism reveal the \nnature of this "wine." At one time all gods recognized the supremacy of \nthe Great Mother, manifesting herself as the spirit of creation (Kali- \nMaya). She "invited them to bathe in the bloody flow of her womb and \nto drink of it; and the gods, in holy communion, drank of the fountain \nof life (hie est sanguis meusl) and bathed in it, and rose blessed to \nthe heavens." \' To this day, cloths allegedly stained with the God- \ndess\'s menstrual blood are greatly prized as healing charms. 12 \nW.R. Smith reported that the value of the gum acacia as an amulet "is \nconnected with the idea that it is a clot of menstrous blood, i.e., that \nthe tree is a woman." For religious ceremonies, Australian aborigines \npainted their sacred stones, churingas, and themselves with red ochre, \ndeclaring that it was really women\'s menstrual blood. 13 \n\nThe esoteric secret of the gods was that their mystical powers of \nlongevity, authority, and creativity came from the same female \nessence. The Norse god Thor for example reached the magic land of \nenlightenment and eternal life by bathing in a river filled with the \nmenstrual blood of "giantesses" that is, of the Primal Matriarchs, \n"Powerful Ones" who governed the elder gods before Odin brought \nhis "Asians" (Aesir) out of the east. 14 Odin acquired supremacy by \nstealing and drinking the "wise blood" from the triple cauldron in the \nwomb of Mother-Earth, the same Triple Goddess known as Kali-Maya \nin southeast Asia. \n\nOdin\'s theft of menstrual magic paralleled that of Indra, who stole \nthe ambrosia of immortality in the same way. Indian myth called the \nsacred fluid Soma in Greek, "the body," because the word\'s eastern \nroot referred to a mystical substance of the body. Soma was the object \nof so much holy dread that its interpretations were many. \n\nSoma was produced by the churning of the primal sea (Kali\'s \n"ocean of blood" or sometimes "sea of milk"). Or Soma was secreted \nby the Moon-Cow. Or Soma was carried in the "white pot" (belly) of \nMohini the Enchantress. Or the source of Soma was the moon. Or \nfrom Soma all the gods were born. Or Soma was a secret name of the \nMother Goddess and the active part of the "soul of the world." 15 \n\nSoma was drunk by priests at sacrificial ceremonies and mixed with \nmilk as a healing charm; therefore it was not milk. Soma was \nespecially revered on somvara, Monday, the day of the moon. In an \nancient ceremony called Soma-vati, women of Maharashtra circum- \nambulated the sacred female-symbolic fig tree whenever the new moon \nfell on a Monday. 16 \n\nSome myths claimed the Goddess under her name of Lakshmi, \n"Fortune" or "Sovereignty," gave Soma to Indra to make him king \nof the gods. His wisdom, power, and curiously feminine capacity for \npregnancy, came from Lakshmi\'s mystic drink, "of which none tastes \n\n\n\n636 \n\n\n\nwho dwells on earth." 17 On drinking it straight from the Goddess, Indra Menstrual Blood \n\nbecame like her, the Mount of Paradise with its four rivers, "many- \n\nhued" like the Goddess\'s rainbow veils, rich in cattle and fruiting ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nvegetation. 18 The Goddess\'s blood became his wisdom. Similarly, \n\nGreeks believed the wisdom of man or god was centered in his blood, \n\nthe soul-stuff given by his mother. 19 \n\nEgyptian pharaohs became divine by ingesting "the blood of Isis," \na soma-like ambrosia called sa. zo Its hieroglyphic sign was the same as \nthe sign of the vulva, a yonic loop like the one on the ankh or Cross of \nLife. 21 Painted red, this loop signified the female genital and the Gate \nof Heaven. 22 Amulets buried with the dead specifically prayed Isis to \ndeify the deceased with her magic blood. 23 A special amulet called \nthe Tjet represented Isis\'s vulva and was formed of red substance \njasper, carnelian, red porcelain, red glass, or red wood. This amulet \nwas said to carry the redeeming power of the blood of Isis. 24 \n\nThe same elixir of immortality received the name of amrita in \nPersia. Sometimes it was called the milk of a mother Goddess, \nsometimes a fermented drink, sometimes sacred blood. Always it was \nassociated with the moon. "Dew and rain becoming vegetable sap, \nsap becoming the milk of the cow, and the milk then becoming \nconverted into blood: Amrita, water, sap, milk, and blood represent \nbut differing states of the one elixir. The vessel or cup of this immortal \nfluid is the moon." 25 \n\nCeltic kings became gods by drinking the "red mead" dispensed by \nthe Fairy Queen, Mab, whose name was formerly Medhbh or \n"mead." 26 Thus she gave a drink of herself, like Lakshmi. A Celtic \nname of this fluid was dergflaith, meaning either "red ale" or "red \nsovereignty." In Celtic Britain, to be stained with red meant to be \nchosen by the Goddess as a king. 27 Celtic ruadh meant both "red" \nand "royal." 28 \n\nThe same blood color implied apotheosis after death. The pagan \nparadise or Fairyland was at the uterine center of the earth, site of the \nmagic Fountain of Life. An old manuscript in the British Museum said \nthe dying-and-resurrected Phoenix lives there forever. The central \nHoly Mountain or mons veneris contains both male and female sym- \nbols: the Tree of Life and the Fountain of Eternal Youth, the latter \nobviously menstrual, as it was said to overflow once every lunar \nmonth. 29 \n\nMedieval churchmen insisted that the communion wine drunk by \nwitches was menstrual blood, and they may have been right. The \nfamous wizard Thomas Rhymer joined a witch cult under the tutelage \nof the Fairy Queen, who told him she had "a bottle of claret wine . . . \nhere in my lap," and invited him to lay his head in her lap. 50 Claret \nwas the traditional drink of kings and also a synonym for blood; its name \nmeant literally "enlightenment." There was a saying, "The man in \nthe moon drinks claret," connected with the idea that the wine repre- \nsented lunar blood. 31 \n\n\n\n637 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood \n\n\n\nThe Hebrew word \nfor blood, dam, means \n"mother" or \n"woman" in other \nIndo-European \nlanguages (e.g. dam, \ndamsel, madam, la \ndama, dame) and also \n"the curse" (damn). \nThe Sumerian Great \nMother represented \nmaternal blood and \nbore names like \nDam-kina, \nDamgalnunna. \nFrom her belly flowed \nthe Four Rivers of \nParadise, sometimes \ncalled rivers of blood \nwhich is the "life" of all \nflesh. Her firstborn \nchild, the Savior, was \nDamu, a "child of \nthe blood." 37 Damos or \n"mother-blood" was \nthe word for "the \npeople" in \n\nmatriarchal Mycenae. 58 \nAnother common \nancient symbol of the \nblood-river of life was \nthe red carpet, \ntraditionally trod by \nsacred kings, heroes, \nand brides.\' 9 \n\n\n\nMedieval romance and the courtly-love movement, later related to \nwitch cults, were strongly influenced by the Tantric tradition, in \nwhich menstrual blood was indeed the wine of poets and sages. It is still \nspecified in the Left Hand Rite of Tantra that the priestess imperson- \nating the Goddess must be menstruating, and after contact with her a \nman may perform rites that will make him "a great poet, a Lord of \nthe World" who travels on elephant-back like a rajah. 32 \n\nIn ancient societies both east and west, menstrual blood carried the \nspirit of sovereign authority because it was the medium of transmis- \nsion of the life of clan or tribe. Among the Ashanti, girl children are still \nmore prized than boys because a girl is the carrier of "blood" \n(mogya). The concept is also clearly defined in India, where menstru- \nal blood is known as the Kula flower or Kula nectar, which has an \nintimate connection with the life of the family. When a girl first \nmenstruates, she is said to have "borne the Flower." 34 The corre- \nsponding English word flower has the significant literal meaning of \n"that which flows." \n\nThe British Goddess of flowers was Blodeuwedd, a form of the \nTriple Goddess associated with sacrifices of ancient kings. Welsh \nlegend said her whole body was made of flowers as any body was, \naccording to the ancient theory of body formation from the blood \n"flower." Her name suggests the Blood Wedding, and myth made her \nthe spouse of several murdered heroes, recalling the old idea that the \nGoddess\'s divine blood had to be periodically refreshed by human \nsacrifice. 35 \n\nThe Bible also calls menstrual blood the flower (Leviticus \n1 5:24), precursor of the "fruit" of the womb (a child). As any flower \nmysteriously contained its future fruit, so uterine blood was the \nmoon-flower supposed to contain the soul of future generations. This \nwas a central idea in the matrilineal concept of the clan. 36 \n\nThe Chinese religion of Tao, "the Way," taught Tantric doctrines \nlater supplanted by patriarchal-ascetic Confucianism. Taoists said a \nman could become immortal (or at least long-lived) by absorbing \nmenstrual blood, called red yin juice, from a woman\'s Mysterious \nGateway, otherwise known as the Grotto of the White Tiger, symbol of \nlife-giving female energy. Chinese sages called this red juice the \nessence of Mother Earth, the yin principle that gives life to all things. \nThey claimed the Yellow Emperor became a god by absorbing the \nyin juice of twelve hundred women. 40 \n\nA Chinese myth said the Moon-goddess Chang-O, who controlled \nmenstruation, was offended by male jealousy of her powers. She left \nher husband, who quarreled with her because she had all the elixir of \nimmortality, and he had none, and was resentful. She turned her back \non him and went to live in the moon forever, in much the same way \nthat Lilith left Adam to live by herself at the "Red Sea." Chang-0 \nforbade men to attend Chinese moon festivals, which were afterward \ncelebrated by women only, at the full moon of the autumnal \nequinox. 41 \n\n\n\n638 \n\n\n\nTaoist China considered red a sacred color associated with women, Menstrual Blood \n\nblood, sexual potency, and creative power. White was the color of \n\nmen, semen, negative influences, passivity, and death. 42 This was the ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nbasic Tantric idea of male and female essences: the male principle \nwas seen as "passive" and "quiescent"; the female principle as "active" \nand "creative," the reverse of later patriarchal views. 43 \n\nFemale blood color alone was often considered a potent magic \ncharm. The Maori rendered anything sacred by coloring it red, \nand calling the red color menstrual blood. 44 Andaman Islanders thought \nblood-red paint a powerful medicine, and painted sick people red all \nover in an effort to cure them. 45 Hottentots addressed their Mother \nGoddess as one "who has painted thy body red"; she was divine \nbecause she never dropped or wasted menstrual blood. 46 Some African \ntribes believed that menstrual blood alone, kept in a covered pot for \nnine months, had the power to turn itself into a baby. 47 \n\nEaster eggs, classic womb-symbols of the Goddess Eostre, were \ntraditionally colored red and laid on graves to strengthen the dead. \nThis habit, common in Greece and southern Russia, might be traced all \nthe way back to Paleolithic graves and funeral furnishings reddened \nwith ochre, for a closer resemblance to the Earth Mother\'s womb from \nwhich the dead could be "born again." Ancient tombs everywhere \nhave shown the bones of the dead covered with red ochre. Sometimes \neverything in the tomb, including the walls, had the red color. \nJ.D. Evans described a well tomb on Malta filled with reddened bones, \nwhich struck fear into the workmen who insisted the bones were \ncovered with "fresh blood." 48 \n\nA born-again ceremony from Australia showed that the Aborigines \nlinked rebirth with the blood of the womb. The chant performed at \nAnkota, the "vulva of the earth," emphasized the redness surrounding \nthe worshipper: "A straight track is gaping open before me. An \nunderground hollow is gaping before me. A cavernous pathway is \ngaping before me. An underground pathway is gaping before me. \nRed I am like the heart of a flame of fire. Red, too, is the hollow in \nwhich I am resting." 49 Images like these help explain why some of \nthe oldest images of the Goddess, like Kurukulla in the east and her \ncounterpart Cybele in the west, were associated with both caverns \nand redness. 50 \n\nGreek mystics were "born again" out of the river Styx, otherwise \nknown as Alpha, "the Beginning." This river wound seven times \nthrough the earth\'s interior and emerged at a yonic shrine near the city \nof Clitor (Greek kleitoris) sacred to the Great Mother. 51 Styx was the \nblood-stream from the earth\'s vagina; its waters were credited with the \nsame dread powers as menstrual blood. Olympian gods swore their \nabsolutely binding oaths by the waters of Styx, as men on earth swore by \nthe blood of their mothers. Symbolic death and rebirth were linked \nwith baptism in the waters of Styx, as in many other sacred rivers the \nworld over. Jesus himself was baptized in Palestine\'s version of the \nStyx, the river Jordan. When a man bathed seven times in this river, \n\n\n\n639 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood "his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child" (2 Kings \n\n5:14). In Greek tradition the journey to the land of death meant \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ crossing the Styx; in Judeo-Christian tradition it was crossing the \n\nJordan. This was the same "river of blood" crossed by Thomas Rhymei \non his way to Fairyland. \n\nTantric worship of menstrual blood penetrated the Greco-Roman \nworld before the Christian era and was well established in the Gnostic \nperiod. This worship provided the agape "love-feast" or "spiritual \nmarriage" practiced by Gnostic Christians like the Ophites. Anoth- \ner name for the agape was synesaktism, "the Way of Shaktism," \nmeaning Tantric yoni-worship. 52 Synesaktism was declared a heresy \nbefore the 7th century a.d. 53 Subsequently the "love-feast" disappearec \nand women were forbidden direct participation in Christian worship, \naccording to St. Paul\'s rule (1 Timothy 2:1 1-12). \n\nEpiphanius described the agape practiced by Ophite Christians, \nwhile making it clear that these heretical sexual activities filled him \nwith horror: \n\nTheir women they share in common; and when anyone arrives who \nmight be alien to their doctrine, the men and women have a sign by \nwhich they make themselves known to each other. When they extend \ntheir hands, apparently in greeting, they tickle the other\'s palm in a \ncertain way and so discover whether the new arrival belongs to their cult. \n. . . Husbands separate from their wives, and a man will say to his own \nspouse, "Arise and celebrate the love feast (agape,) with thy brother. " \nAnd the wretches mingle with each other . . . after they have consorted \n\ntogether in a passionate debauch The woman and the man take \n\nthe man s ejaculation into their hands, stand up . . . offering to the Fathei \nthe Primal Being of All Nature, what is on their hands, with the words, \n"We bring to Thee this oblation, which is the very Body of Christ. " \n. . . They consume it, take housel of their shame and say: "This is the \nBody of Christ, the Paschal Sacrifice through which our bodies suffer \nand are forced to confess to the sufferings of Christ. "And when the \nwoman is in her period, they do likewise with her menstruation. The \nunclean flow of blood, which they garner, they take up in the same way \nand eat together. And that, they say, is Christ\'s Blood. For when they \nread in Revelation, "I saw the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, \nyielding its fruit each month " (Rev. 22:2), they interpret this as an \nallusion to the monthly incidence of the female period. M \n\nThe meaning of this Ophite sacrament to its practitioners is \neasily recovered from Tantric parallels. Eating the living substances of \nreproduction was considered more "spiritual" than eating the dead \nbody of the god, even in the transmuted form of bread and wine, \nthough the color symbolism was the same: \n\nWhen the semen, made molten by the fire of great passion, falls into the \nlotus of the "mother" and mixes with her red element, he achieves \n"the conventional mandala of the thought of enlightenment. " The \nresultant mixture is tasted by the united "father-mother" [Yab- Yum], \nand when it reaches the throat they can generate concretely a special bin \n\n\n\n640 \n\n\n\n::c \n\n\n\n. . . the bodhicitta the drop resulting from union of semen and Menstrual Blood \n\nmenstrual blood is transferred to the yogi This empowers his \n\ncorresponding mystic veins and centers to accomplish the Buddha\'s \n\nfunction of speech. The term "secret initiation " comes from the tasting of ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe secret substance. yy \n\nIn the occult language of the Tantras, two ingredients of the \nGreat Rite were sukra, semen, and rakta, menstrual blood. The officiat- \ning priestess had to be menstruous so her lunar energies were at flood \ntide. 56 She embodied the power of rakta, sometimes rendered rukh or \nruq, cognate with the Hebrew ruach, "spirit," and the Arabic ruh, \nwhich meant both "spirit" and "red color." Throughout all Tantric and \nrelated faiths, the merging of female red and male white was "a \nprofoundly important symbolic conjunction." 57 \n\nThe Sufis, who practiced their own brand of Tantrism, said ruh \nwas female and red. Its male counterpart sin, "consciousness," was \nwhite. Red and white colors alternated in the Sufi halka or magic circle, \ncorresponding to the Tantric chakra and called "the basic unit and \nvery heart of active Sufism." The Arab rosary of alternating red and \nwhite beads had the same meaning: men and women coupled around \nthe circle, as in most European folk dances. 58 \n\nRed and white were the colors worn by alternating female-and- \nmale dancers in the witches\' "fairy ring" of pagan Ireland, where the \nGoddess was worshipped under the same name as the Tantric earth \nmother, Tara. 59 With men and women alternating as in a Tantric \nchakra, the dance moved counterclockwise or moonwise, as nearly all \ncircle dances still do. Red and white colors "represented the fairy \nworld." 60 \n\nThe rites were often governed by old women, due to the ancient \nbelief that post-menopausal women were the wisest of mortals be- \ncause they permanently retained their "wise blood." In the 17th century \na.d., Christian writers still insisted that old women were filled with \nmagic power because their menstrual blood remained in their veins. 61 \nThis was the real reason why old women were constantly persecuted \nfor witchcraft. The same "magic blood" that made them leaders in the \nancient clan system made them objects of fear under the new \npatriarchal faith. \n\nBecause menstrual blood occupied a central position in matriar- \nchal theologies, and was already sacer holy-dreadful \npatriarchal-ascetic thinkers showed almost hysterical fear of it. The \nLaws of Manu said if a man even approached a menstruating woman he \nwould lose his wisdom, energy, sight, strength, and vitality. The \nTalmud said if a menstruating woman walked between two men, one of \nthe men would surely die. 62 Brahmans ruled that a man who lay with \na menstruating woman must suffer a punishment one-quarter as severe \nas the punishment for Brahmanicide, which was the worst crime a \nBrahman could imagine. Vedic myths were designed to support the law, \njj iuch as the myth that Vishnu dared copulate with the Goddess Earth \n\n\n\n641 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood while she was menstruating, which caused her to give birth to monsters \n\nwho nearly destroyed the world. 63 \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m This was patriarchal propaganda against the Tantric Maharutti \n\n("Great Rite"), in which menstrual blood was the essential ingredi- \nent. In Kali\'s cave-temple, her image spouted the blood of sacrifices \nfrom its vaginal orifice to bathe Shiva\'s holy phallus while the two \ndeities formed the lingam-yoni, and worshippers followed suit, in an \norgy designed to support the cosmic life-force generated by union of \nmale and female, white and red. 64 In this Great Rite, Shiva became the \nAnointed One, as were his many Middle-Eastern counterparts. The \nGreek translation of Anointed One was Christos. \n\nPersian patriarchs followed the Brahman lead in maintaining that \nmenstruous women must be avoided like poison. They belonged to \nthe devil; they were forbidden to look at the sun, to sit in water, to speal \nto a man, or to behold an altar fire. 65 The glance of a menstruous \nwoman was feared like the glance of the Gorgon. Zoroastrians held tha \nany man who lay with a menstruating woman would beget a demon, \nand would be punished in hell by having filth poured into his mouth. 66 \n\nPersian religion incorporated the common primitive belief that th< \nfirst onset of menses must be caused by copulation with a supernatu- \nral snake. People not yet aware of fatherhood have supposed the same \nsnake renders each woman fertile and helps her conceive children. 67 \nSome such belief prevailed in Minoan Crete, where women and snake! \nwere sacred, but men were not. Tube-shaped Cretan vessels for \npouring oblations represented a vagina, with a serpent crawling inside. 6 \nAncient languages gave the serpent the same name as Eve, a name \nmeaning "Life"; and the most ancient myths made the primal couple \nnot a Goddess and a God, but a Goddess and a Serpent. 69 The \nGoddess\'s womb was a garden of paradise in which the serpent lived. \n\nPhrygian Ophiogeneis, "Snake-born People," said their first male \nancestor was the Great Serpent who dwelt in the garden of para- \ndise. 70 Paradise was a name of the Goddess-as- Virgin, identified with \nMother Hera (Earth), whose virgin form was Hebe, a Greek spelling \nof Eve. Virgin Hera parthenogenetically conceived the oracular serpen \nPython, of the "Womb-temple," Delphi. 71 Snakes living in the \nwomb of Mother Earth were supposed to possess all wisdom, being in \ncontact with the "wise blood" of the world. \n\nOne of the secrets shared by the primordial woman and her \nserpent was the secret of menstruation. Persians claimed menstrua- \ntion was brought into the world by the first mother, whom they called \nJahi the Whore, a Lilith-like defier of the Heavenly Father. She \nbegan to menstruate for the first time after coupling with Ahriman, the \nGreat Serpent. Afterward she seduced "the first righteous man," who \nhad previously lived alone in the garden of paradise with only the divin< \nsacrificial bull for company. He knew nothing of sex until Jahi taught \nhim. 72 \n\n\n\n642 \n\n\n\nV.\'jfc \n\n\n\nThe Jews borrowed many details from these Persian myths. Menstrual Blood \n\nRabbinical tradition said Eve began to menstruate only after she had \n\ncopulated with the serpent in Eden, and Adam was ignorant of sex until ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nEve taught him. 75 It was widely believed that Eve\'s firstborn son Cain \nwas not begotten by Adam but by the serpent. 74 Beliefs connecting \nserpents with pregnancy and menstruation appeared throughout \nEurope for many centuries. Up to modern times, German peasants still \nheld that women could be impregnated by snakes. 75 \n\nWhether initiated by a serpent or not, menstrual bleeding inspired \ndeadly fear among both Persian and Jewish patriarchs (Leviticus 1 5). \nRachel successfully stole her father\'s teraphim (household gods) by \nhiding them under a camel saddle and sitting on it, telling her father \nshe was menstruating so he dared not approach her (Genesis 3 1). To \nthis day, orthodox Jews refuse to shake hands with a woman because \nshe might be menstruating. Jews also adopted a rule apparently laid \ndown by Hesiod, that a man must never wash in the same water \npreviously used by a woman, lest it might contain a trace of menstrual \nblood. 76 \n\nThere were many similar taboos. The ancient world\'s most dread- \ned poison was the "moon-dew" collected by Thessalian witches, said \nto be a girl\'s first menstrual blood shed during an eclipse of the moon. 77 \nPliny said a menstruous woman\'s touch could blast the fruits of the \nfield, sour wine, cloud mirrors, rust iron, and blunt the edges of knives. 78 \nIf a menstruous woman so much as laid a finger on a beehive, the \nbees would fly away and never return. 79 If a man lay with a menstruous \nwoman during an eclipse, he would soon fall sick and die. 80 \n\nChristians inherited all the ancient patriarchs\' superstitious horrors. \nSt. Jerome wrote: "Nothing is so unclean as a woman in her periods; \nwhat she touches she causes to become unclean." Penitential regula- \ntions laid down in the 7th century by Theodore, Bishop of \nCanterbury, forbade menstruating women to take communion or even \nenter a church. At the French Synod of Meaux, menstruous women \nwere specifically forbidden to come to church. From the 8th to the 11th \ncenturies, many church laws denied menstruating women any access \nto church buildings. As late as 1684 it was still ordered that women in \ntheir "fluxes" must remain outside the church door. 81 In 1298 the \nSynod of Wiirzburg commanded men not to approach a menstruating \nwoman. 82 The superstition came down to the 20th century, when a \nScottish medical text quoted an old rhyme to the effect that menstrual \nblood could destroy the entire world: \n\nOh! Menstruating woman, thou \'rt a fiend \n\nFrom which all nature should be closely screened. 83 \n\nChristian women were commanded to despise the "unclean- \nness" of their own bodies, as in the Rule for Anchoresses: "Art thou not \nformed of foul slime? Art thou not always full of uncleanness?" 84 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n643 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood \n\n\n\nDr. Augustus Kins- \nley Gardner Eminent \nphysician of the late \n19th century, opponent \nof all forms of birth \ncontrol, which he \nclaimed led "directly \nand indisputably" to \nnervous diseases and \ndebilities. \n\n\n\nMedical authorities of the 16th century were still repeating the old belief \nthat "demons were produced from menstrual flux." 85 One of the \n"demons" born of menstrual blood was the legendary basilisk with its \npoisonous glance. 86 The legend evidently arose from the classic myth \nof the Gorgon with her serpent-hair and wise blood, petrifying men \nwith her glance. The Gorgon and the red cross of menstrual blood \nonce marked the most potent taboos. 87 The very word taboo, from \nPolynesian tupua, "sacred, magical," applied specifically to menstrual \nblood. 88 \n\nJust as primitives attributed beneficial powers to menstrual blood \nalong with its fearfulness, so medieval peasants thought it could heal, \nnourish, and fertilize. 89 Some believed a menstruating woman could \nprotect a crop by walking around the field, or exposing her genitals in \nit. 90 Peasant women carried seed to the fields in rags stained with their \nmenstrual blood: a continuation of the custom of Eleusinian fertility- \npriestesses. 91 Even doctors thought menstrual blood could cure leprosy, \nor act as a powerful aphrodisiac. Madame de Montespan used it to en- \ncourage the ardor of her royal lover, Louis XIV. 92 Gypsies said a woman \ncould win any man\'s love with a potion of her own menstrual blood. 93 \n\nAs the former medium of reincarnation, menstrual blood was \nsometimes called a remedy for death itself. In the tale of Childe Roland, \nthe elven-king roused men from the magic sleep of death with a "bright \nred liquor." 94 Early romances associated this universal heal-all with "the \nblood of a noble virgin," as a wise-woman revealed to Galahad. 95 The \nsame belief impelled Louis XI to try to stave off death by drinking \nyoung girls\' blood. \n\nVictorian superstition taught that a child conceived during a \nmenstrual period would be born with a caul, and would have occult \npowers. 96 Nineteenth-century doctors inherited their predecessors\' no- \ntions of witchcraft and evil, and so maintained that menstruating \nwomen are not healthy; copulation with them could infect a man with \nurethritis or gonorrhea. Dr. Augustus Gardner said venereal diseases \nwere usually communicated from women to men, not vice versa. 97 \nSpeaking of savages\' menstrual taboos, anthropologists described the \nwomen as "out of order," "suffering from monthly illness," or "stricken \nwith the malady common to their sex." 98 A doctor wrote even in the \npresent century: "We cannot too emphatically urge the importance of \nregarding these monthly returns as periods of ill health, as days when \nthe ordinary occupations are to be suspended or modified." 99 \n\nAt the present time just as in the Middle Ages, the Catholic church \nstill considers itself on firm theological ground by advancing, as an \nargument against ordination of women, the notion that a menstruating \npriestess would "pollute" the altar. This would not preclude ordination \nof post-menopausal women, but different excuses are found for those. \nThe holy "blood of life" used to be feminine and real; now it is \nmasculine and symbolic. \n\n\n\n644 \n\n\n\n1.

The \nthirteen annual lunations of the latter produced one of the contrasting \nanswers to the nursery-rhyme riddle: "How many months be in the \nyear? There be thirteen, I say." Christians produced another answer: \n"There be but twelve, I say." The lunar calendar\'s thirteen 28-day \nmonths had four 7-day weeks apiece, marking new, waxing, full, and \nwaning moon-sabbaths in the ancient form. Weeks are still lunar, but \nthey no longer fit neatly into the solar month system. Thirteen lunar \nmonths gave 364 days per year (1 3 X 28), with one extra day to \nmake 365. Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, witch charms, ballads and other \nrepositories of pagan tradition nearly always describe the full annual \ncycle as "a year and a day." \n\nIt has been shown that calendar consciousness developed first in \nwomen, because of their natural menstrual body calendar, correlated \nwith observations of the moon\'s phases. Chinese women established a \nlunar calendar 3000 years ago, dividing the celestial sphere into 28 \nstellar "mansions" through which the moon passed. Among the \nMaya of central America, every woman knew "the great Maya calendar \nhad first been based on her menstrual cycles." * Romans called the \n\n\n\n645 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Calendar calculation of time mensuration, i.e., knowledge of the menses. Gaelic \n\nwords for "menstruation" and "calendar" are the same: miosach and \n^^^^^^^^^^^ miosachan. The new-moon sabbaths of ancient Latium were kalends, \npossibly related to the Aryan name of Kali. For fear of disrupting the \nGoddess\'s transitions, activities of some kinds were forbidden on the \nseventh day of each lunar phase; thus sabbaths became "unlucky" or \ntaboo. Because it was the time-honored custom, even the biblical God \nwas forced to "rest" on the seventh day. \n\nOne of the prototypes of Yahweh was the Babylonian god Mar- \nduk, who divided the maternal "waters" into those above and below \nthe firmament (Genesis 1:7). Marduk claimed to be the creator, but was \nnot yet so patriarchal as to abandon his Mother\'s lunar calendar. \nBabylonian priests said Marduk established holy days and seasons by the \nmoon. 2 Yet older traditions said the menstrual calendar was instituted \nin Babylon by the god Nabu-Rimmani, the biblical Baal-Rimmon, a \nphallic deity united with the Great Mother\'s yoni in the form of a \npomegranate. 3 \n\nThe Chinese explained their menstrual calendar with the myth of \nthe holy calendar plant, lik-kiep, on which a pod grew every day for \n14 days, then a pod fell off every day for 14 days. When the months be- \ncame confused by solar reckoning, the Chinese added extra days \nwhen "a pod withered without falling off." 4 \n\nAccording to another story, the menstrual calendar was called \nHsiu, "Houses." The Moon Mother rested each night of the lunar \nmonth in a different one of her 28 houses, which were kept by the 28 \nwarrior-hero consorts she had placed in heaven to attend her. 5 \n\nThe ancient Hebrews took their calendar from Chaldea, legendary \nhome of Abraham, whose older name was Ab-sin, "Moon-father." 6 \nChaldeans were credited with the invention of astrology, now largely \nbased on the movements of the sun; but the Chaldeans didn\'t study \nthe sun. They were "Moon-worshippers," believing the moon deter- \nmined the fates of men by her movements through various "houses" \nof the zodiac. The same lunar myths were found in Egypt, northern \nEurope, Greece, and Rome. Latin kings were sacrificed at the three- \nday dark of the moon period called ides, to insure the Goddess\'s safe \nreturn from the underworld. Greeks similarly made offerings at the \nGreat Sabbath called Noumenia (New Moon). The other Great Sab- \nbath was Dichomenia (Full Moon), when the Goddess stood at the \npeak of her cycle. 7 \n\nEarly attempts at calendar reform left Greek city-states quarreling \namong themselves about sabbaths and intercalary days. Aristopha- \nnes\'s The Clouds makes the Moon-goddess complain that her \nreckoning of the days was not being correctly followed. 8 Time-spans \nin myths became confused. Adonis was born after "ten months\' gesta- \ntion," which really meant ten lunar months, the normal 280 days. 9 \nAccording to the Book of Maccabees, every gestation lasted ten \nmonths. 10 This wasn\'t ignorance; it was just lunar reckoning. \n\n\n\n646 \n\n\n\nLEven the saints\' days of the medieval church were established by Menstrual Calendar \n\nenology, literally "knowledge of the moon." The church\'s so-called \nmovable feasts were movable because they were determined by lunar ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ncycles, not solar ones; thus they drifted erratically through the months \nof the canonical calendar. The most important of them, Easter, is still \ndetermined by the moon (first Sunday after the first full moon after \nthe spring equinox), at a time when the Goddess slew and re-conceived \nthe Savior or vegetation god for a new season. 11 \n\nMore confusion was created by the fact that menstrual calendars \nreckoned the day from noon to noon, with the midnight hour in the \ncentral position; but solar calendars reckoned the day from midnight to \nmidnight. The Saxon word den (day) really meant "night." In \nShakespeare\'s time, people said goodnight by wishing each other good \nden, literally good moon-day. Old French nursery rhymes greeted \nthe moon rising in the evening with "Good morning, Madame \nMoon." n The meridian or high point of noon used to indicate the \nfull moon overhead at midnight: hence its name Meri-Dia or Mary- \nDiana, the Moon-goddess. Superstitious folk talked of the \ndaemonium meridianum, devil of the meridian, a diabolization of the \nGoddess. 13 She was probably the second of the Slavic trinity of Fates \n(Zorya), called "She of the Evening, She of Midnight, and She of \nMorning," in that order. 14 \n\nPagans held their festivals at night, by moonlight: a custom that \nmight be traced as far back as ancient Egypt, where major religious \nceremonies were nocturnal, as listed in the Book of the Dead: \n\nThe night of the battle and of the overthrow of the Sebau-Beld in Tattu \n. . . , the night of waking to stand up the double Tet in Sekhem . . . , the \nnight of establishing Horus in the heritage of the things of his father in \nRekhti . . . , the night when Isis maketh lamentation at the side of her \nbrother Osiris in Abtu . . . , the night of the Haker festival when a division \nis made between the dead and the spirits who are on the path of the dead \n. . . , the night of the judgment of those who are to be annihilated at the \ngreat festival of the ploughing and the turning up of the earth. ls \n\nPre-Christian Europe also gave night precedence over day. \nGermanic tribes, Celts, Gauls, druids, the ancient Irish calculated \n"months, years, and birthdays in such a way as to make the night \nprecede the day." 16 Caesar noted that the Celts measured time by \nnights instead of by days. 17 \n\nChristian holy days were copied from pagan ones, displaced by 12 \nhours in their solar reckoning; therefore the older, heathen version of \neach festival was celebrated on the "Eve" of its Christian counterpart. \nFrom this arose the so-called devilish rites of May Eve, Midsummer \nEve, Lammas Eve, All Hallow\'s Eve, and Christmas Eve which was \ntaken from the pagan Yule, and to a late date was still called the \nNight of the Mother. 18 \n\nWitch persecutors pretended the witches copied their sabbats from \nChristian feast days in deliberate mockery of the church; but in fact \n\n\n\n647 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Calendar the copying had gone in the other direction. The church took over the \n\npagan feasts of Halloween, May Day, Lammas, Imbolg, Midsum- \n^^^^^^^^^^^ mer, Easter, Yule, and so on, then claimed to have invented them. \nHowever, of the two rival festivals on the same day, the Christian one \nwas invariably the newcomer. 19 \n\nMay Eve was the Saxons\' Walpurgisnacht, the Celts\' Beltain, \nannouncing the opening of the Merry Month of sexual license and \n"wearing of the green" in honor of the earth\'s new spring garment. The \noccasion was still marked by pagan ceremonies in the late 16th \ncentury. 20 (See May.) Midsummer Eve merged with St. John\'s Day, \nbut the solstitial rites remained more pagan than Christian. Lammas \nEve was a witches\' Great Sabbat because it was formerly the pagan \nFeast of Bread (Hlaf-mass) in honor of the Corn-mother. 21 Hallow- \neen was All Hallows\' or All Souls\' eve, from the Celtic Samhain or \nFeast of the Dead, when pagan ancestors came forth from their fairy- \nmounds, and Christians called them "demons" who attended the \nwitches\' feasts. 22 \n\nThe thirteen months of the menstrual calendar also led to \npagan reverence for the number 13, and Christian detestation of it. \nWitches\' "covens" were supposed to be groups of 1 3 like the moon- \nworshipping dancers of the Moorish zabat (sabbat), to whom thirteen \nexpressed the three-in-one nature of the lunar Goddess. 23 \n\nSome said thirteen was a bad number because Christ was the \nthirteenth in the group of apostles, thus the thirteenth member of any \ngroup would be condemned to death. Actually, it was the church\'s \nopposition to pagan symbolism that brought opprobrium on the \nnumber 1 3. Some even feared to speak its true name, and it was \neuphemized as a "baker\'s dozen," or sometimes "devil\'s dozen." 24 \n\nThe heathen tradition persisted in such symbols as the Thirteen \nTreasures of Britain, probably lunar-month signs taken from a primi- \ntive list of zodiacal constellations. They were defined as a sword, basket, \ndrinking horn, chariot, halter, knife, cauldron, whetstone, garment, \npan, platter, chessboard, and mantle. 25 The thirteen menstrual months \nwere symbolized in the Tarxien temple on Malta as a sow with 1 3 \nteats, like the Celts\' Sow-goddess Cerridwen. 26 Thirteen "moons" of \nthe menstrual calendar were suggested also by the English Twelfth \nNight custom of kindling twelve small fires and one large one, to \nrepresent the moon of the New Year. 27 \n\nIn general, the symbols of ancient matriarchy came to be known as \nnight, the moon, and the number 13, while those of patriarchy were \nday, the sun, and the number 12. \n\n1.

Old Welsh \ntraditions called Merlin a "wild man of the woods" with prophetic or \nshamanistic skills; he was named either Lailoken or Myrrdin. Geoffrey \nof Monmouth said Merlin\'s earlier name was Ambrosius, associating \nhim with the female-symbolic "ambrosia" given by the Fairy Queen to \nher chosen bards and magicians. 1 In medieval falconry, a merlin was \na kind of hawk that could be flown only by a lady. 2 \n\nMerlin learned all his magic from the Goddess, in the guise of \nMorgan le Fay, or Viviane (She Who Lives), or the Lady of the \nLake. At the end of his life she took him back into her magic cave and \nwrapped him in deathless sleep until his Second Coming. Here she \nwas called Nimue, or Fate, the same as the Moon-goddess Diana \nNemorensis, or the Nemesis of the Greeks. Pagan Britons believed \nMerlin would return from his enchanted sleep to announce the coming \nof a new age of peace and fertility. \n\nChristian writers however made Merlin a child of the powers of \n\n\n\n650 \n\n\n\n[hell. According to Robert de Borron, Merlin was deliberately con- \nceived to become Antichrist; he was fathered on a virgin by a devil. He \npossessed a benevolent nature because of his mother\'s goodness, \nwhich prevailed over his demonic nature. \n\nWhen King Vortigern\'s temple was being built on Salisbury Plain, \nIthe structure persisted in falling down because so the astrologers \njsaid its foundations needed the blood of a child who had no human \njfather. Young Merlin fitted the description and was brought to be \nisacrificed; but his magical X-ray vision discovered the real cause of the \ntrouble. A red and a white dragon were fighting in a mystic pool \nunder the temple\'s foundations. Merlin prophesied from this that \niVortigern, the Welsh red dragon, would be slain by Uther Pendrag- \npn, the British white dragon; and it so happened. Afterward, Merlin \nbuilt Stonehenge by himself, in one night calling all its massive stones \nfrom Ireland with his magic songs. 3 \n\nMerlin was also an artisan and a smith. He forged King Arthur\'s \nmagic armor and a wonderful cup identified with the Holy Grail. He \nbuilt the palace at Camelot. 4 He made the Round Table, symbol of the \npagan lunar calendar. The first tally of its knights made up the \n(moon\'s number, 28. 5 \n\nThe Round Table seems to have been derived from the sacred \nmensa, calendar-table, of Vesta. Petronius said it was a Round Table \nwith the Goddess\'s image in its center. It represented the earth, which \nt Anaximenes described as "like a Table in form." Plato\'s Symposium \nsaid the table stood for Mother Earth because "besides feeding us it is \nround in shape, it is fixed, and very suitably it has been given by some \ni me name of Hestia." 6 \n\nMerlin\'s secret cave was located either in the Breton fairy-wood of \nBroceliande, or in the British druidic shrine of Mount Ambrosius. \nSome said this was Chislehurst, a chalk cliff honeycombed with caves, \n||ong occupied by a college of druidesses. 7 Merlin was associated with \n:he druidic Goddess under many of her names: Morgan, Viviane, \n[Nimue, Fairy Queen, Lady of the Lake the Celtic Water-goddess \nMuirgen, often called boine clergesse (the Good Priestess). Because \nVIerlin was clearly connected with Goddess worship and the mass of \nMerlin literature was for centuries a vehicle for criticism of the church, \nin the 16th century the Council of Trent placed the Book of Merlin\'s \n[Predictions on the Index of Prohibited Books. 8 \n\n1.

Then in 1847 it was discovered that "mesmer- \nized" people tended to have religious experiences, and to claim powers \nof clairvoyance and prophecy. Therefore the church declared hereti- \ncal "those who profess to see things which are invisible ... or apply \npurely physical principles to things which are in reality supernatural." \nFinally in 1856 an encyclical letter warned the clergy that mesmerism \nwas a dangerous "error." \' It was a good example of the church\'s \nrefusal to admit any source of spiritual illumination or mythic imagery \nother than its own. \n\n1. Bromberg, 164. \n\n\n\nMessiah \n\nPersian title of the Anointed One (Greek Christos) supposed to come \nto earth just before doomsday; based on the Kalki Avatara, final \nincarnation of Buddha, due to appear in time to save the virtuous, \nbefore destruction of this universe. 1 \n\nPersians sometimes identified the Messiah with the virgin-born \nprophet Zoroaster, who would return as his own reincarnation or \n"son" just before the final battle of the God of Light and the God of \nDarkness (Ahura Mazda and Ahriman). 2 \n\nThe Jews called the Messiah "Mashiach," and identified him with \nElijah. Passover ceremonies required four cups of wine, one left \nuntasted. This was the Cup of Elijah which would be mysteriously \ndrained before the Second Coming. During the Middle Ages, the \nhopes of oppressed Jewry were raised from time to time by a report that \nsomeone\'s Cup of Elijah had been emptied by a miracle. 3 \n\nThe Talmud spoke of two Messiahs; Messiah ben David and \nMessiah ben Joseph. For this reason, Christian genealogies tried to \nmake Jesus both of them at once, through his mother Mary of the house \nof David, and through his father Joseph. Some versions of the \nGospels said Joseph was Jesus\'s natural father, other versions said he war \n\n\n\n652 \n\n\n\nI not. 4 Like the Persian Messiah he was also the mutually contradictory Metis \n\nSon of Man and Son of God.

Thus he was able to give \nirth to Metis\'s child Athene from his own head. Older versions of the \nnyth show that Metis was really Medusa, whose Gorgon face and \n;nake hair symbolized Female Wisdom. Athene was the virgin form of \nhe same Goddess, born not from Zeus\'s head but from the triple \nGorgon in the land of Libyan Amazons, who worshipped Medusa- \nvletis as the Mother of Fate. 1 A later, Gnostic-Christian version of \n:he same Goddess was Sophia, whose name also meant "Wisdom." \n1.

See \nOmphalos. \n\nl.Lethaby, 62. \n\n\n\nMidwifery \n\nFrom Anglo-Saxon med-wyf, "wise-woman" or "witch." Even in the \nChristian era, priestesses of the Great Mother maintained their monop- \noly of obstetrics, for most men were afraid of the taboo mysteries of \nbirth. The Bible declared a new mother sacer or untouchable for as long \nas 66 days after giving birth (Leviticus 12:5); and by canon law, a \nmother was not allowed to enter a church until 40 days after childbed. \n\n\n\n654 \n\n\n\nFor the first half of the Christian era, the arts of medicine Midwifery \n\ntemained almost exclusively in the hands of "wise-women" because \n\nindent healing shrines had been devoted almost exclusively to the ^_^^^_^___ \n\ngoddess\'s priestesses. 1 In ancient Egypt, midwifery was the province \n>f Sevenfold Hathor who gave each infant its seven souls. The Malayan \nSemai still say all midwives are holy, partaking of the spirit of the First \nVlidwife who lives in the highest of the seven heavens, each one of \nvhich is ruled by one of the Seven Celestial Midwives, identical with \nhe Hathors. An earthly midwife is a sort of fairy godmother, with a \npiritual tie to each child she brings into the world. 2 \n\nMexican peasants attribute similar powers to the recibidora who \nombines the functions of obstetrician, godmother, priestess, and \nvitch. She performs complicated knot-magic in binding and tying the \nimbilical cord and casts spells for the future fate of the newborn. 3 \n\nPagan Rome recognized several kinds of midwives, who received \n;eparate offerings after a successful birth. There was the obstetrix \nvho performed the delivery; the nutrix or "nurturer" who encouraged \n[he mother\'s milk and taught techniques of nursing; and the ceraria, \njxiestess of Ceres charged with birth rituals. 4 All were connected with \n[he women\'s temple, like the Greek Horae who were temple-women \npn earth and ascended to heaven as midwives to the gods. \n\nMedieval Christianity detested midwives for their connections with \nDagan matriarchy and Goddess-worship. Churchmen viewed them as \nmplacable enemies of the Catholic faith. Handbooks of the Inquisition \nirtated: "No one does more harm to the Catholic faith than mid- \nlives," because they invariably offered newborn children to the service \n)f the devil with a magical baptism by the kitchen fire. 5 The real \nreason for ecclesiastical hostility seems to have been the notion that \nmidwives could help women control their own fate, learn secrets of \n;ex and birth control, or procure abortions. The pagan women of \nantiquity had considerable knowledge of such matters, which were \n:onsidered women\'s own business, not subject to male authority. 6 \nPatriarchal religion however forbade midwives to assist their patients \nn preventing conception, relieving themselves of unwanted pregnan- \nes, or easing their birth-pangs. \n\nIn 1 591 a Scottish noblewoman, Eufame Macalyne, was burned \nalive for asking a witch-midwife for drugs to ease her labor pains. 7 \nParliamentary Articles of Enquiry in 1559 ordered churchwardens to \njreport any use of "charms, sorcery, enchantments, invocations, \ncircles, witchcrafts, soothsaying," or any like procedures "especially in \nkhe time of women\'s travails." 8 \n\nSome charms and sorceries were allowed as long as they were of \nthe Christian variety: that is, with Christian names substituted for \npagan ones in the formulae. Women in childbed were officially advised \nito bind around their thighs a long charm in Latin, beginning In \nnomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus SanctiAmen, followed by invocations \nof saints and secret names of God. If the names were not Christian, \n\n\n\n655 \n\n\n\nMidwifery however, the charm was devilish. An episcopal injunction of 1 5 54 said \n\nmidwives must not "use or exercise any witchcraft, charms, sorcery, \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ invocations, or prayers other than such as be allowable and may stand \nwith the laws and ordinances of the Catholic church." 9 \n\nChristianity\'s official view was that to relieve women\'s sufferings in \nany aspect of reproduction was to oppose God\'s will in the matter of \nthe curse on Eve. God decreed that she and all her female descendants \nmust bring forth children with "sorrow" (pain). Consequently, up to \nthe beginning of the 20th century, doctors refused to consider treatment \nof the major cause of women\'s deaths, childbed (puerperal) fever. \nThe clergy held such deaths to be either a just reward for an immoral \nlife, or the expression of God\'s continuing judgment on "the sex." I0 \n\nWhen James Simpson proposed to relieve women\'s labor pains \nwith the newly discovered anesthetics, chloroform and ether, there \nwas a great outcry from the clergy, who called it a sinful denial of God\'s \nwishes. According to Scottish clergymen, to relieve labor pains would \nbe "vitiating the primal curse against woman." n A New England \nminister wrote: "Chloroform is a decoy of Satan, apparently offering \nitself to bless women; but in the end it will harden society and rob God \nof the deep earnest cries which arise in time of trouble, for help." 12 \nWith the usual half-concealed sadism of patriarchal morality, he was \nreally saying that female screams of pain gave God pleasure, and men \nmust see to it that God was not deprived of this. \n\nThe matter was resolved when Queen Victoria allowed her doctor \nto give her chloroform during delivery of her eighth child, and \npublicly hailed the new pain-reliever as a great blessing. All at once the \nclergymen were silenced, in effect conceding to the Queen the right \nto overrule God. 13 \n\nToward the end of the 19th century, male doctors moved in on \nthe last remaining area of exclusively female medicine, and took the \nmidwifery-trade away from women. At the instigation of the American \nMedical Association, the U.S. Congress outlawed midwives, and the \nnew male "obstetricians" replaced them. Frequently, an elder midwife \nfound herself out of work, or even in jail for illegal practice, in a \ncommunity most of whose members she had brought into the world! 14 \n\nThe effects of the new male professionalism were not always \nbeneficial: \n\nOur mechanized civilization, in the interest of a speedy delivery, at the \nconvenience, even at the timed participation of the physician, often \nendangered mother and child with impatient interference in the natural \nprocess, and too often compounded this mistake by anesthetizing the \nmother completely. All too soon, as a result of scientific pride over \ninventing a formula for feeding independent of the natural source of \nmilk, the child was parted from its mother and deprived not only of \nmother\'s milk, but of the experience of a warm, loving, commensal \nrelationship with her, the kind we must have also with Mother Earth. ,s \n\nThe male-dominated medical profession not only took up delivering \n\n\n\n656 \n\n\n\nLvomen\'s babies, but even presumed to teach women how to "mother" Milky Way \n\ni:hem which often led to terrible mistakes like the tum-of-the-century \n\nminimal-handling theory, which assumed that crying children must not ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n3e "spoiled" by cuddling them but should be picked up only at \npredetermined infrequent intervals. Perhaps the ultimate hubris was \nattained by L.K. Frank who wrote: "The psychiatrist is uniquely \nCompetent to tell us how to practice the Christian injunction to love \nlittle children." 16 Here is modern "education" ignorant of the histori- \ncal truth that the very existence of the human race depended for \nbountless thousands of years long before either Christianity or \npsychiatry were heard of on the unique ability of mothers to love little \nIchildren and of "wise-women" to assist the instincts of motherhood. \n\n1.

Ionians said \nthe stars came from the udder of their own Moon-Cow, Io, "the \nMoon." 2 Others said the Moon-Cow was Europa, consort of Zeus as a \ntotemic white bull. All white Moon-Cows were the same Goddess, \nknown from India to Scandinavia as the nourisher of the world and the \nmother of the star-spirits. 3 See Cow. \n\nThe Four Rivers of Paradise were supposed to pour from the four \n(teats of the Moon-Cow\'s udder. Norsemen said these rivers came \nfrom the udder of Audumla, the Nourisher, a divine cow who existed \nbefore any other creature. 4 She was identified with Mana, the Moon \nMother. Scandinavian mythology knew the Milky Way as Manavegr, \n"Moon-Way." 5 To the Celts, it was Bothar-bo finne, Track of the \nWhite Cow. 6 The primordial white cow whose udder produced the \nstar-rivers was almost certainly the same cow who "jumped over the \nmoon" in the nursery rhyme, because she was shown hovering over the \nmoon in pre-Christian icons. \n\nAkkadians called the Milky Way River-of-the-Divine-Lady, or \nHiddagal, the Great River, which the Bible rendered Hiddekel \n(Genesis 2:14). Arabians called the Milky Way Umm alSama, Mother \nof the Sky. 7 Egyptians called the Milky Way the "Nile in the Sky," \nwhich poured from the udder of the Moon-Cow, Hathor-Isis, who thus \ngave rain to the rest of the world, though she reserved her "true \nNile" for Egypt. \n\nClassic mythology made the galactic mother Gala-Tea, "Milk \nGoddess," a white statue of Aphrodite carved by her priest-consort \n\n\n\n657 \n\n\n\nMimemata Pygmalion, whose name was a Greek form of Pumiyathon, priest- \n\nMiniato, Saint consort of Astarte-Hathor at Byblos. 8 Alternatively, the galaxy spurted \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m from the breasts of Hera when she suckled Heracles; or else it came \nfrom the breasts of Rhea when she suckled Zeus. 9 Names differed, \nbut everywhere the Milky Way was regarded as the Goddess\'s star-milk, \nwhich formed curds to create worlds and creatures. \n\nThe Rabelaisian statement that the moon is made of green cheese \ndates back to old legends of the moon\'s creation as a ball of cheese \ncurdled from the Milky Way. 10 Sometimes it was the earth that was \nmade of green cheese from the Goddess\'s milk. The Bible copied a \nformer address to the Goddess: "Hast thou not poured me out as milk, \nand curdled me like cheese?" (Job 10:10). \n\nAnglo-Saxon names for the Milky Way suggested that it was not \nonly a river but also a main street of heaven. It was called Irmin\'s \nWay, Waetlinga Straet, Vaelinga, Vaetlinga, or Watlingastrete, Wadlyn \nStreet, and Watling Street. 11 \n\n1. Lawson, 13. 2. Graves, G.M. 1, 190, 196. 3.

Mariamne, \nMiriamne \n\n\n\n659 \n\n\n\nMirror St. Miriamne said to be a daughter of St. Philip, himself once the pagan \n\ngod of May Day. 1 See Mari; Mary. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ 1 . Brewster, 221. \n\n\n\nMirror \n\nThe ancients attributed mystic powers to any reflective surface, solid \nor liquid, because the reflection was considered part of the soul. Heavy \ntaboos were laid on the act of disturbing water into which a person \nwas gazing, because shattering the image meant danger to the soul. \nHence the similar taboo on breaking a mirror, now said to bring \nseven years\' bad luck. \n\nDamage to the reflection-soul was the real basis of the myth of \nNarcissus, usually misinterpreted as a fable of excessive self-love. \nNarcissus couldn\'t bear to leave the reflection of his beautiful face in th< \nmagic pool of the nymph Echo, and so he pined away and died, and \nturned into a flower on the bank. Echo also pined until nothing \nremained of her but a voice. Actually, Echo was the Goddess of \ndeath-by-water, who lay in wait to seize one\'s reflection-soul, according \nto beliefs still current among Africans and Melanesians. 1 Narcissus \nwas another name of the sacrificed springtime-flower hero also called \nAntheus, Adonis, Hyacinthus, or Dionysus, who died at the May \nDay Heroantheia (Hero-flowering) in Crete, Mycenae, and \nLacedaemon. 2 \n\nA mirror meant the god\'s death in the Pelasgian myth of Dionysus \nThe Titans trapped his soul in a mirror, as the soul of Narcissus was \ntrapped in reflective water. Then Dionysus was torn to pieces in the rite \nof the omophagy (see Cannibalism). Many centuries later, the \ngypsies repeated a tale of Dionysus transformed into the Enchanted or \nAccursed Hunter, whose soul was trapped in a mirror by a "witch" \nMara, the same as the Hindu death-spirit Mara. 3 Among Slavic gypsies, \nMara or Mora was a destroying Fate-goddess who rode the night \nwinds and "drank the blood of men." 4 \n\nThe tragically deceased Narcissus was taken into the Christian \ncanon as a saint, said to have been a "bishop" of Jerusalem in the first \ncentury (when there were no bishops of Jerusalem). Instead of dying \nlike his ephebic namesake at the pinnacle of youth and beauty, St. \nNarcissus lived to be 116 years old. 5 He was one of the pseudosaints \nwhose legend was supposed to convince the pagans that the Christian \nfaith could grant the gift of longevity. \n\nMirrors were connected with death in many Christian supersti- i \ntions. Demons, werewolves, vampires, and such "soulless" creatures \nshowed no reflection in a mirror. Many Europeans still turn mirrors to \nthe wall after a death in the house, in the belief that mirrors trap the \nsouls of the living or detain the souls of the dead on their journey. 6 \nSome say one who looks in a mirror in a house of death will see not \n\n\n\n660 \n\n\n\nhis own face but the face of the deceased. 7 Pope John XXII had an Mistletoe \n\ninordinate fear of mirrors; he claimed wizards sent devils to attack \n\nhim through mirrors. 8 ^ ^^ \n\nThe so-called witch\'s mirror could be made of polished stone, a \nsheet of metal, a crystal, or a bowl of water or ink. Water represented \nthe Abyss, the numinous hidden spirit world; its reflections therefore \ncould be read as shadows cast ahead by future events. In fairy tales, \nthe land of souls often appeared as a hall of mirrors. 9 \n\nCabalists professed to read the will of the seven planetary spirits in \nseven mirrors, each made of the appropriate metal for its day, its \ndeity, and its subject matter. Questions about the great folk of the earth \nwere addressed to a golden mirror on Sun-day. Dreams and mystic \nenlightenment were observed on Monday (Moon-day) with a mirror of \nsilver. Enmities and lawsuits were resolved on Tuesday with a Mars \nmirror of iron. A Mercury mirror of quicksilver in glass was consulted \non Wednesday about money matters. A Jupiter mirror of tin was \nquestioned on Thursday about worldly successes. Questions of love \nwere resolved on Friday with a Venus mirror of copper. Lost articles \nand secrets could be discovered on Saturday by a Saturn mirror of \nlead. 10 \n\nThe esoteric meaning of the mirror was explained long ago by \nPlotinus, who connected it with the Hindu concept of Maya, crea- \ntress of the "reflections" of spiritual reality in the mirror of the material \nworld. "Matter serves as a mirror upon which the Universal Soul \nprojects the images or reflections of its creations, and thus gives rise to \nthe phenomena of the sensible universe." n \n\nOriental mystics were close to the conclusion that the Universal \n\nSoul really meant one\'s own soul, where reality was perceived as in a \n\nmirror, darkly. A Buddhist aphorism said: "All existence is like a \n\nreflection in a mirror, without substance, only a phantom of the \n\nmind. When the finite mind acts, then all kinds of things arise; when the \n\nfinite mind ceases to act, then all kinds of things cease." 12 In other \n\nwords, the world exists only for those who live and perceive it. This was \n\nan idea that Western philosophers played with endlessly, even to the \n\nlogical but irrational idea that if there were no intelligent beings to \n\nperceive it, the universe would not exist at all. \n\n1.

The gold color of dry mistletoe was seen as a \nsymbol of apotheosis, as was gold metal. The living plant was viewed \nas the genitalia of the oak god, Zeus or Jupiter or Dianus of Dodona, \n\n\n\n661 \n\n\n\nMistletoe consort of the Moon-mother Diana Nemetona, Lady of the Grove. \n\nAt the season of sacrifice, druidic priests ceremonially castrated the oak \n^^^^^^^^^^^ god by cutting off his mistletoe with a golden moon-sickle, catching it \nin a white cloth before it could touch the ground, so it remained like \nevery sacrificial deity "between heaven and earth." \' \n\nThe phallic significance of mistletoe probably stemmed from the \nnotion that its whitish berries were semen-drops, as the red berries of \nits feminine counterpart, holly, were equated with the Goddess\'s men- \nstrual blood. Among Indo-European peoples generally, castration of \nthe god was customary before his immolation. \n\nSacred-oak cults continued throughout the Christian era. In the \n8th century a.d., the Hessians worshipped the oak god at Geismar \nand gave hjs holy tree the name of Jove (Jupiter). As late as 1874, an an- \ncient oak-tree shrine in Russia was worshipped by a congregation led \nby an Orthodox priest. Wax candles were affixed to the tree, and the \ncelebrants prayed, "Holy Oak Hallelujah, pray for us." A drunken \norgy ensued. 2 Modern customs of kissing under the mistletoe are pale \nshadows of the sexual orgies that once accompanied the rites of the \noak god. \n\nTo Nordic pagans, mistletoe symbolized the death of the savior- \ngod Balder, son of Odin, whose Second Coming was expected after \ndoomsday, when he would return to earth to establish the new creation. \nBalder was slain by a spear of mistletoe wielded by Hod, the Blind \nGod, another name for Odin himself. Or, some said Hod was Balder\'s \ndark twin, corresponding to the light-and-dark year-gods Set and \nHorus in Egypt. 3 \n\nSome derive the Saxon mis-el-tu from Mas, the Sanskrit "Messi- \nah" (Vishnu), and tal, a pit, metaphorically the earth\'s womb. Thus it \nstood for the god\'s entry into his Mother-bride. Norsemen\'s word for \nmistletoe was Guidhel, the same "guide to hell" as Virgil\'s Golden \nBough. 4 \n\nAfter they were converted to Christianity, Saxons claimed the \nmistletoe was "the forbidden tree in the middle of the trees of Eden," \ni.e., the Tree of Knowledge, which was Ropularly supposed to have \nfurnished the wood for Jesus\'s cross. 5 \n\nThe phallic meaning of the mistletoe made it the "key" that \nopened the underworld womb, key and phallus being interchange- \nable in mystical writings. Some treatises said, "All locks are opened by \nthe herb Missell toe." Combined with the "feminine" herb Alcyone, \nit "makes a man do often the act of generation." 6 \n\nThe pagan\'s interpretations of mistletoe were still understood in \nRenaissance times, when it was adopted as an emblem of the new \nMessiah and "carried to the high altar" of English churches on \nChristmas Eve. But some Christian writers insisted that the mistletoe \n"never entered those sacred edifices but by mistake, or ignorance of the \n\n\n\n662 \n\n\n\njjxtons; for it was the heathenish and profane plant, as having been of Mithra \n\nbch distinction in the pagan rites of Druidism." 7 \n\n1.

In 307 a.d. the emperor officially designated \nMithra "Protector of the Empire." l \n\nChristians copied many details of the Mithraic mystery-religion, \nxplaining the resemblance later with their favorite argument, that \nle devil had anticipated the true faith by imitating it before Christ\'s \nirth. Some resemblances between Christianity and Mithraism were \n3 close that even St. Augustine declared the priests of Mithra wor- \nlipped the same deity as he did. 2 \n\nMithra was born on the 25th of December, called "Birthday of the \nle Unconquered Sun," which was finally taken over by Christians in \nle 4th century a.d. as the birthday of Christ. 3 Some said Mithra sprang \nom an incestuous union between the sun god and his own mother, \nist as Jesus, who was God, was born of the Mother of God. Some \nlaimed Mithra\'s mother was a mortal virgin. Others said Mithra had \no mother, but was miraculously born of a female Rock, the petra \nenetrix, fertilized by the Heavenly Father\'s phallic lightning. 4 \n\nMithra\'s birth was witnessed by shepherds and by Magi who \njrought gifts to his sacred birth-cave of the Rock. 5 Mithra performed \nne usual assortment of miracles: raising the dead, healing the sick, \nlaking the blind see and the lame walk, casting out devils. As a \nleter, son of the petra, he carried the keys of the kingdom of heaven \nlee Peter, Saint). 6 His triumph and ascension to heaven were \ndeb rated at the spring equinox (Easter), when the sun rises toward its \npogee. \n\nBefore returning to heaven, Mithra celebrated a Last Supper with \nis twelve disciples, who represented the twelve signs of the zodiac, \ni memory of this, his worshippers partook of a sacramental meal of \nread marked with a cross. 7 This was one of seven Mithraic sacra- \nlents, the models for the Christians\' seven sacraments. 8 It was called \nlizd, Latin missa, English mass. Mithra\'s image was buried in a rock \n>mb, the same sacred cave that represented his Mother\'s womb. He \n\'as withdrawn from it and said to live again. 9 \n\nLike early Christianity, Mithraism was an ascetic, anti-female \niligion. Its priesthood consisted of celibate men only. 10 Women \n-ere forbidden to enter Mithraic temples. 11 The women of Mithraic \n\n\n\n663 \n\n\n\nMithra families had nothing to do with the men\'s cult, but attended services \n\nof the Great Mother in their own temples of Isis, Diana, or Juno. 12 \n\nmm ^^^^ mmg ^ l ^ m To eliminate the female principle from their creation myth, \n\nMithraists replaced the Mother of All Living in the primal garden of \nparadise (Pairidaeza) with the bull named Sole-Created. Instead of Eve \nthis bull was the partner of the first man. All creatures were born \nfrom the bull\'s blood. Yet the bull\'s birth-giving was oddly female- \nimitative. The animal was castrated and sacrificed, and its blood was \ndelivered to the moon for magical fructification, the moon being the \nsource of women\'s magic lunar "blood of life" that produced real \nchildren on earth. 13 \n\nPersians have been called the Puritans of the heathen world. The] \ndeveloped Mithraism out of an earlier Aryan religion that was not so \npuritanical or so exclusively male-oriented. 14 Mithra seems to have bee \nthe Indo-Iranian sun god Mitra, or Mitravaruna, one of the the \ntwelve zodiacal sons of the Infinity-goddess Aditi. Another of Aditi\'s \nsons was Aryaman, eponymous ancestor of "Aryans," whom the \nPersians transformed into Ahriman, the Great Serpent of Darkness, \nMithra\'s enemy. 15 \n\nEarly on, there seems to have been a feminine Mithra. Herodotus \nsaid the Persians used to have a sky-goddess Mitra, the same as \nMylitta, Assyria\'s Great Mother. 16 Lydians combined Mithra with his \narchaic spouse Anahita as an androgynous Mithra-Anahita, identified \nwith Sabazius-Anaitis, the Serpent and Dove of Anatolian mystery \ncults. 17 \n\nAnahita was the Mother of Waters, traditional spouse of the solar \ngod whom she bore, loved, and swallowed up. She was identified \nwith the Anatolian Great Goddess Ma. Mithra was naturally coupled \nwith her, as her opposite, a spirit of fire, light, and the sun. 18 Her \n"element," water, overwhelmed the world in the primordial flood, \nwhen one man built an ark and saved himself, together with his cattle, \naccording to Mithraic myth. 19 The story seems to have been based on \nthe Hindu Flood of Manu, transmitted through Persian and Babylo- \nnian scriptures to appear in a late, rather corrupt version in the Old \nTestament. See Flood. \n\nWhat began in water would end in fire, according to Mithraic \neschatology. The great battle between the forces of light and darkness \nin the Last Days would destroy the earth with its upheavals and \nburnings. Virtuous ones who followed the teachings of the Mithraic \npriesthood would join the spirits of light and be saved. Sinful ones who v \nfollowed other teachings would be cast into hell with Ahriman and \nthe fallen angels. The Christian notion of salvation was almost wholly a \nproduct of this Persian eschatology, adopted by Semitic eremites and \nsun-cultists like the Essenes, and by Roman military men who thought \nthe rigid discipline and vivid battle-imagery of Mithraism appropriate ] \n\n\n\n664 \n\n\n\nfor warriors. Under emperors like Julian and Commodus, Mithra Mffi \n\nbecame the supreme patron of Roman armies. 20 Mnemosyne \n\nAfter extensive contact with Mithraism, Christians also began to _^^__^^____ \n\ndescribe themselves as soldiers for Christ; to call their savior Light of \nthe World, Helios the Rising Sun, and Sun of Righteousness; to \ncelebrate their feasts on Sun-day rather than the Jewish sabbath; to \nclaim their savior\'s death was marked by an eclipse of the sun; and to \nadopt the seven Mithraic sacraments. Like Mithraists, Christians \npracticed baptism to ascend after death through the planetary spheres to \nthe highest heaven, while the wicked (unbaptized) would be dragged \ndown to darkness. 21 \n\nMithra\'s cave-temple on the Vatican Hill was seized by Christians \nn 376 ad. 22 Christian bishops of Rome pre-empted even the Mithraic \nft nigh priest\'s title of Pater Patrum, which became Papa, or Pope. 23 \nMithraism entered into many doctrines of Manichean Christianity \njnd continued to influence its old rival for over a thousand years. 24 The \nMithraic festival of Epiphany, marking the arrival of sun-priests or \n\nPagi at the Savior\'s birthplace, was adopted by the Christian church \nly as late as 8 1 3 a.d. 25 \n\nI.

Later popes carried on the pagan tradition \n\\y blessing Christian amulets and holy medals which were also used \np trade, like money. 1 \n\nThe attendant spirit of Juno Moneta was the erotic Cupid, \n^responding to the Greeks\' Eros, who was both child and compan- \npn of Aphrodite. Thus, "cupidity" used to mean erotic desire, but in \nChristian times its meaning was changed to greed for money. \n\n1 . Larousse, 204. \n\n\n\nMonotheism \n\nThough in practice they worshipped three gods, one goddess, and \nnnumerable demigods (angels and saints), Christian theologians insist- \nxl their religion was monotheism, and monotheism was the highest \nbrm of religion. Vetter comments: \n\nOne might well ask, where is the evidence that the worship of one \nsupreme god is so superior to the worship of several gods? that is \nunless one takes the position that it is difficult enough to furnish proof of \nthe existence of one god, and that each additional god assumed to exist \nwould simply double the problem faced. If the reduction in numbers of \ndeities of itself has merit, then why are not those religions in which no \ngods whatever are worshipped the "highest" of all?\' \n\n\n\n667 \n\n\n\nMons Veneris There was nothing lofty about the original impulse toward \n\nmonotheism: the conceit of kings who identified themselves with a god \n\ni^^^HBM and demanded that god\'s supremacy. One of the earliest self- \nworshipping monotheists was the Egyptian pharaoh Ikhnaton \n(Akhenaten), who reigned from 1379 to 1362 B.C. \n\nIkhnaton decided that the sole supreme deity was Aton, symbol- \nized by the sun disc and incarnate on earth in himself. He moved his \nfamily and court to an earthly paradise 300 miles north of Thebes, to a \nsite now called Tell el Amarna, a great city and temple-palace. He \nordered even the word "gods" removed from inscriptions throughout \nthe land, so his own divine alter ego reigned alone. Jewish monothe- \nism probably originated in Egypt. The Old Testament contains writings \ncopied from the cult of Aton, especially the 104th Psalm, thought to \nhave been written by Ikhnaton himself. \n\nEgyptian priesthoods of the old deities refused to tolerate the royal i \nmonotheism. Ikhnaton died mysteriously. His body disappeared, and \nwasn\'t buried in the tomb prepared for it. His name was erased from \nking lists. He was described as a criminal. 2 The Egyptians plainly \nwere not disposed to call monotheism a "higher" religion. \n\nAnother self- worshipper was the Roman emperor Elagabalus (He-- \nliogabalus), who identified himself with the solar god El Gabal, and \ntried to absorb all other deities into a single faith. He built a temple on \nthe Palatine, "and he desired to bring into that temple the image of \nthe Magna Mater and the fire of Vesta and the Palladium and the \nshields and all things that were sacred to the Romans; and he strove to \nbring it to pass that no god save El Gabal should be worshipped in \nRome." 3 But the Roman people were not ready to limit themselves \nto El Gabal or any other single god. \n\nFifty years later, Aurelian erected in the Campus Martius his greati \ntemple to the Mithraic sun god, Deus Sol Invictus, the only god. \nDiocletian also declared this god Rome\'s sole ruling deity. Mithraism \nalmost succeeded in establishing Roman monotheism. Mithra was \nadored "from the mouth of the Danube to Hadrian\'s Wall in Britain, \nfrom Hadrian\'s Wall to the Pillars of Hercules, and from the Pillars of \nHercules to the Desert of Sahara." Moesia, Dacia, Pannonia, and \nNoricum adopted the cult, as did southern France, especially Lyons. I \nMithraic inscriptions and sanctuaries have been found at Ostia, Naples, \nPalermo, Syracuse, Spoleto, and other sites. 4 See Mithra. \n\nl.Vetter, 206-7. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Ikhnaton." 3.

Medical terminology still calls the \npubic area mons veneris. Medieval Europe had mountains of the \n\n\n\n668 \n\n\n\nsame name.

Oriental nations in general worshipped the moon \npore the sun. 4 Moses Maimonides said moon worship was the religion \n|f Adam. 5 The Gnostic sect of Naassians believed in a primordial \neing known as "the heavenly horn of the moon." 6 The moon was the \nternal Great Mother. In central Asia it was said the moon is the \n| Joddess\'s mirror reflecting everything in the world, like the mirror of \nlaya. 7 \n\nMany savages revere the moon more than the sun, reasoning that \nle Moon-mother gives her light at night, when it is needed, whereas \nie sun shines only by day. This belief presupposes that sunlight and \naylight are not the same, a common idea among primitives. 8 Writers \nthe Bible made this same mistake. They said God created "light" \nlaylight) before the sun and moon (Genesis 1:5, 16). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD \n\n\n\nMoon \n\n\n\n669 \n\n\n\nMoon \n\n\n\nMana or men gave \nthe name of the pre- \nRoman Latin \nGoddess Menrva \n(Minerva), and such \nwords as mentality, \nmenstrual, menol- \nogy, mensuration, \nmentor, menage (a \nmatrilineal household), \nomen (a revelation \nfrom the moon), and \namen (the moon of \nrebirth). \n\n\n\nAshanti people had a generic term for all deities, Boshun, \n"Moon." In the Basque language, the words for "deity" and "moon" \nwere the same. Sioux Indians called the moon "The Old Woman Who \nNever Dies." Iroquois called her "The Eternal One." 9 Rulers in the \nEritrean zone of South Africa bore the Goddess\'s name, "Moon." 10 \nAncient rulers of the Tutsi tribe were named Mwezi, "Moon." n \nThe Gaelic name of the moon, gealach, came from Gala or Galata, \noriginal Moon-mother of Gaelic and Gaulish tribes. Britain used to \nbe called Albion, the Milk-white Moon-goddess. Persians called the \nmoon Metra (Matra, mother), "whose love penetrated \neverywhere." 12 \n\nThe root word for both "moon" and "mind" was the Indo- \nEuropean manas, mana, or men, representing the Great Mother\'s \n"wise blood" in women, governed by the moon. 13 Its derivative mania \nused to mearl ecstatic revelation, just as lunacy used to mean \npossession by the spirit of Luna, the moon. 14 To be "moon-touched" 01 \n"moon-struck" meant to be chosen by the Goddess; a "moon-calf" \nwas one carried away by love of her. When patriarchal thinkers belittled \nthe Goddess, these words came to mean mere craziness. The \nmoonstruck person was described as "silly," a word that formerly meant \n"blessed," possibly derived from Selene, the Moon. 15 \n\nTo the Greeks, menos meant both "moon" and "power." To the \nRomans, the morality of the Moon-goddess was superior to that of \nthe Sun-god. Plutarch said, "The effects of the moon are similar to the \neffects of reason and wisdom, whereas those of the sun appear to be \nbrought about by physical force and violence." 16 \n\nIn many cultures, the Moon-goddess and the Creatress were one \nand the same. Polynesians called the Creatress Hina, "Moon." She \nwas the first woman, and every woman is a wahine, made in the image \nof Hina. 17 To the Finns, the Creatress was Luonnotar (Luna, the \nMoon). She brooded over the sea until she brought forth the World \nEgg, heaven, and earth. 18 Scandinavians sometimes called the Crea- j \ntress Mardoll, "Moon Shining Over the Sea." 19 \n\nThe Moon-goddess created time, with all its cycles of creation, \ngrowth, decline, and destruction, which is why ancient calendars \nwere based on phases of the moon and menstrual cycles (see Men- \nstrual Calendar). The moon still determines agricultural work in \nsome parts of India. 20 Indonesian moon priestesses were responsible for I \nfinding the right phase of the moon for every undertaking. The \nDayaks prayed to the moon for children, increase of cattle, and \nabundant crops; they said she was the cause and measurer of time. 21 \nGreeks said the same of Demeter, whose priests were called Sons of the j \nMoon. 22 \n\nPeruvians called the moon either Mama Quilla or Mama Ogllo, ; \nsometimes identifying the two as mother and daughter, like Demeter I \nand Kore. Mama Quilla married the sun and gave birth to Mama Ogllol \n"Egg," the moon-maiden and her brother the sun-man. These two \n\n\n\n670 \n\n\n\nmated and founded the Inca royal line on the site of Cuzco, "the Moon \n\nNavel," in Inca cosmology the center of the world. 23 \n\nBecause the Moon-goddess was threefold, the Destroyer as well as ^_.^_^^^_ \nthe Creator, she was the devourer of the dead as well as the giver of \nlife. In Mexico her Destroyer aspect was Mictecaciuatl, who roamed the \nskies at night, seeking victims to devour. She was called Lady of the \nPlace of the Dead, in appearance like Kali the Destroyer. She was not \nonly the moon but also the All-mother from whose genital hole in the \nearth humanity crawled in the beginning, and to which humanity would \nreturn. 24 \n\nThe Vedas say all souls return to the moon after death, to be \ndevoured by maternal spirits. 25 Trobriand Islanders spoke of these \nspirits as "female sorcerers" associated with the moon, eaters of the \ndead. 26 Maoris called the Moon Mother "man-eater." Tartars of \ncentral Asia worshipped the moon as Macha Alia, Queen of Life and \nDeath, said to be an eater of men. Africans said the moon searched \nfor men to devour. 27 \n\nOrphic and Pythagorean sects viewed the moon as the home of \nthe dead, a female Gate (yoni) through which souls passed on the way \nto the paradise-fields of the stars. 28 Greeks often located the Elysian \nFields, home of the blessed dead, in the moon. 29 Kastor of Rhodes said \nthe shoes of Roman senators were decorated with ivory lunules \n(crescents) to show that after death they would inhabit the moon. 30 \nRoman religion taught that "the souls of the just are purified in the \nmoon." 31 Wearing the crescent was "visible worship" of the Goddess. 32 \nThat was why the prophet Isaiah denounced the women of Zion for \nwearing lunar amulets (Isaiah 3:18). "The crescent moon worn by \nDiana and used in the worship of other Goddesses is said to be the \nArk or vessel of boat-like shape, symbol of fertility or the Container of \njthe Germ of all life." 33 The same Ark carried gods, like Osiris, into \ndeath; which may account for Jeremiah\'s hostility to the Ark\'s symbol- \nfern (Jeremiah 3:16). \n\nSemites feared the devouring Old Moon as Hindus feared the \ndevouring Kalika. Her dual nature may account for the correlation \nbetween Semitic ima, "mother," and e-mah, "terror." 34 Superstitious \nChristians sometimes refused to sleep where moonlight might touch \njthem. According to Roger Bacon, "Many have died from not protecting \nthemselves from the rays of the moon." 35 There was always an \nissociation with death: \n\nThe idea of the journey to the moon after death is one which has been \npreserved in the more advanced cultures. . . . It is not difficult to find \n. . . themes of the moon as the Land of the Dead or the regenerating \nreceptacle of souls. . . . This is one reason why the moon presides over \nthe formations of organisms, and also over their decomposition. i6 \n\nBecause the moon was the receptacle of souls between reincar- \nnations, it sheltered both the dead and the unborn, who were one and \n\n\n\n671 \n\n\n\nMoon \n\n\n\nDigby mystery play \n\nEnglish Renaissance \npassion play, Mary \nMagdalene, by an \nanonymous author \ntentatively identified as \nMiles Blomefylde. \n\n\n\nthe same. Believers in prophetic dreams said if a man dreamed of his \nown image in the moon, he would become the father of a son. If a \nwoman dreamed of her own image in the moon, she would give birth \nto a daughter. 57 \n\nMost important for its association with birth, the moon was \nsupposed to be the receptacle of menstrual blood by which each \nmother formed the life of her child. This sacer, taboo moon-fluid kep \neven the gods alive. The moon was "the cup of the fluid of life \nimmortal, quickening the vegetable realm and whatsoever grows in the \nsub-lunar sphere, quickening also the immortals on high." 38 \n\nMany myths of the moon-journey bore witness to the ancient \nbelief in lunar heavens. Gypsies opposed the Christian savior with \ntheir own Romany savior who carried souls to the moon, like Hermes \nPsychopomp. 39 Strangest of all myths of the moon-journey was one \ninvolving Jesus himself. The Digby mystery play of the 1 6th century \nquoted "Jesus\'s hymn to the Moon, his mother, the vessel ... in \nwhom he rested before he ascended to the Sun." 40 \n\nPeasants in France and Portugal confused Jesus\'s mother with thi \nMoon-goddess, whom they called "Our Lady" and "Mother of \nGod." 41 Scottish women curtsied to the moon when they saw her, \nsaying "It is a fine moon, God bless her." 42 In the Loire district, \nchildren\'s rhymes spoke of Madame Moon, giver of babies. 43 A medi- \neval German sect of Cathari worshipped the moon as Heva (Eve), \nMother of All Living, an older incarnation of the virgin Mary. 44 Even \nthe orthodox church held that, as Jesus was the second Adam, so \nMary was the second Eve; and Mary was associated with both the moon \nand the sea. \n\nAs the moon governs the sea\'s tides, so she was supposed to goverr \nthe tides of life and death. Shore dwellers had an ineradicable \nconviction that a baby can be born only on an incoming tide, and a \ndying person cannot expire until the tide goes out. As a corollary, it \nwas often said birth at a full tide or a full moon betokens a lucky life. 45 \nThe soul may ride the tide in lunar form, according to Caesarius of \nHeisterbach: "The soul is a spiritual substance of spherical nature, like \nthe globe of the moon." 46 \n\nScottish girls refused to schedule a wedding day for any time othei \nthan the full moon, the most fortunate time for women. 47 Scandina- \nvian women particularly prized amulets made of silver, the moon metal. \nThe moon was the special deity of women even during the Renais- \nsance, when it was said if a woman wanted anything she should not ask \nGod but should pray instead to the moon. 48 \n\nWitches invoked their Goddess by "drawing down the moon," a \nrite dating back to moon-worshipping Thessaly, centuries before the \nChristian era. 49 Thessalian priestesses also prefigured "witchcraft" by \nlaying curses with "moon-dew," said to be the first menstrual blood \nof girls gathered during a lunar eclipse. 50 Medieval folk believed such a \n\n\n\n672 \n\n\n\ncurse incurable. St. Augustine and other fathers of the church Moon \n\njbelieved what Virgil said about moon-priestesses, that they could draw \n\ndown the moon, stop rivers in their courses, turn back the wheel of ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe stars, or bring trees marching downhill. 51 St. Augustine berated \n\nwomen for dancing "impudently and filthily all the day long upon the \n\n|days of the new moon." 52 \n\nFew religious symbols occurred in so many diverse contexts as \nsymbols of the moon. In the runic menological calendar the moon- \nsickle stood for the festival of Harvest Home, which the Scots called \nKirn from Koreion, moon-virgin Kore which Christians renamed \n!the Feast of Our Lady of Mercy. 55 In Gaul the crescent moon stood for \nthe druidic Diana. Crescere meant "to grow," a form of Latin creare, \nto produce, to create. 54 Hence the crescent. Gauls made communion \nbakes in crescent shape. Modern France still makes them, and calls \njrhem croissants, "crescents," colloquially known as "moon-teeth." 55 \n\nThe moon ruled the sexuality of women, and sometimes made \nthem scornful of the male-dominated society\'s notions of hierarchy. \nAn astrological book of 1688 warned: "The double conjunction of \nVenus and the Moon produces extreme lubricity, brings venereal \ndisease, and causes women of quality to become enamored of \nmenservants." 56 \n\nDespite all the church\'s condemnations, rural folk continued to \n\n[rust the Moon-mother in all their most important activities. A \n\nIpopular almanac said: "Kill fat swine for bacon about the full moon. . . . \n\niJhear sheep at the moon\'s increase: fell hand timber from the full to \n\njhe change . . . ; horses and mares must be put together in the increase \n\n|f the moon, for foals got in the wane are not accounted strong . . . ; \n\nfruit should be gathered, and cattle gelded, in the wane of the moon." \n\nMost of all, the moon always governed magic. Melton said in 1620 \n\nmat no sorcerer ever drew a circle of protection without observing the \n\nlime of the moon. 57 \n\n1. Knight, S.L., 99. 2. Hallet, 115. 3. Cumont, A.R.G.R., 19, 69. \n\n4.

They seem to have \nrepresented the Lady of Life and Lord of Death common to most \npagan traditions. \n\n\n\nMordred \n\n"The Killer," who was a son, a uterine nephew, supplanter, and \nOedipal rival of King Arthur, who tried to escape Fate by destroying \nMordred as soon as he was born, and failed. Mordred survived an \nintended Slaughter of the Innocents, grew up, and lived to betray and \nslay his father-king. Like other supplanter-gods he was born of a \nversion of the Triple Goddess, Margawse, the middle one of Arthur\'s \nthree "sisters" who really represented the Virgin, Mother, and \nCrone. See Arthur. \n\n\n\nMorgan Le Fay \n\nCeltic death-goddess: Morgan the Fate, or Fata Morgana, or the \nTriple Morrigan, or "Morgue la Faye." Sometimes she was a Ninefok \nGoddess, the Nine Sisters called Morgen ruling the Fortunate Isles in \\ \nthe far west, where dead heroes went. 2 Sometimes she, or they, became \nmermaids. Morgans or "sea-women" could "draw down to their \npalaces of gold and crystal at the bottom of the sea or of ponds, those \nwho venture imprudently too near the water." 3 \n\nLike Macha, the Crone aspect of the Morrigan, Morgan as \nMother Death cast the destroying curse on every man. Even Arthuri- , \nan romances which presented her as a human being, Arthur\'s sister, \ninconsistently admitted: "Morgan the Goddess is her name, and \nthere is never a man so high and proud but she can humble and tame : \nhim." 4 \n\nSometimes she kindly promised immortality to her favored lovers, \nlike Ogier the Dane, who accompanied her to her paradise. As the \nMorrigan, she stage-managed the contest between Cu Chulainn and a \ngiant named Terrible. She presided over Cu Chulainn\'s killing of his \nspringtime rival, in a tale based on the Celtic legend of Gawain and the \nGreen Knight. 5 \n\nMorgan sat at the head of the table in the Green Knight\'s castle, \npresiding over the death and resurrection of the rival year-gods as \nthey beheaded one another in their proper seasons. Gawain was \nobviously a solar hero, his strength waxing in the morning and \nwaning in the afternoon; he was one of four brothers representing the 1 \nfour solar seasons. The Green Knight was his perpetual antagonist. \n\n\n\n674 \n\n\n\nLike Njord and Frey, Horus and Set, Gwynn ap Nudd and Gwythyr Moras \n\nson of Greidawl, they rose again and killed each other at the turning Morrigan \n\nof the year. Gawain bore Morgan\'s pentacle as a heraldic device on his ^ __ \nblood-red shield. He and his rival seem to have established the \nceremony of knighthood, a symbolic decapitation, which formerly \ntransformed a victim into a god at the year\'s end. 6 \n\nLate romances deprived Morgan of her divinity and made her \nhuman, just as the Great Goddess Mari became a mortal virgin \nMary. Morgan became Arthur\'s sister, yet "a great clerk of necroman- \ncy," a prototypical witch. 7 She received a fictitious husband, King \nUriens of Gore, probably a corrupt form of the classic castrated heaven- \ngod Uranus. Her name was applied to anything magical, miraculous, \nor misleading, as the Fata Morgana. An old word for witches\' spells, \nglamor, came from Glamorgan, the Goddess\'s sacred territory in \nWales. \n\nMorgan\'s mysterious Fortunate Isles continued to appear in Irish \n\nfolklore up to the present time. It was claimed that off the coast of \n\nGalway nine islands rose out of the sea every seven years; but if anyone \n\ntried to reach them by boat, they would vanish. 8 \n\n1. Keightley, 45. 2.

Queens of Ulster governed her shrine, Emain \nMacha, or Macha\'s Emania, land of the moon. 2 She laid the death \ncurse on Cu Chulainn, and haunted battlefields, making magic with \nthe blood of slain men. 3 In the form of a raven she emerged from her \nfairy-mound and perched on a standing-stone, singing of her Myster- \nies: "I have a secret that you shall learn. The grasses wave. The flowers \nglow golden. The goddesses three low like kine. The raven Morrigan \nherself is wild for blood." 4 See Trinity. \n\n1. Rees, 36; Graves, W.G., 409. 2.

This Akkadian \nGreat Mother was \nassociated with many \ntales of heroes float- \ning on rivers in infancy \nfor this was a mythic \nsymbol of birth-waters. \nRome\'s Acca Laren- \ntia drew Romulus and \nRemus from their \nfloating basket on the \nTiber, in the same \nmyth-cycle. 4 Egypt\'s \nversion of her was \nthe "pharaoh\'s daugh- \nter" of the Moses \nmyth, i.e., Hekat the \nMidwife, or Heka- \nAkka. \n\n\n\nSir Flinders Petrie said the name Moses was Egyptian, as in Thut- \nmose, Ahmoses, etc., meaning "unfathered son of a princess." An \nEgyptian model for Moses\'s myth was the demigod Heracles of \nCanopus, drawn from an ark in the Nile bulrushes. When he grew up, \nhe performed great deeds, and finally died on a mountaintop. 1 \n\nThe myth was not only Egyptian. It was applied to many heroes \nand god-kings. King Sargon of Akkad, 2242-2186 B.C., was a virgin- \nborn son of a temple maiden, whose title enitum meant Virgin Bride of \nGod, like the Semitic kadesha. She set Sargon afloat on the river in a \nbasket of rushes. He was rescued by the divine midwife, Akki the Water \nDrawer, now transformed into Aquarius. He passed through the \nsacred king\'s customary adventures: an early threat of destruction from \nthe incumbent monarch, a period of exile in the wilderness, tempta- \ntion by evil spirits, finally elevation to the throne as the spouse of the \nGoddess Ishtar. 2 \n\nThe fatherless hero born of "waters" (Maria) was a universal \nimage of the sacred king, repeated in the myths of Perseus, Horus, \nJason, Oedipus, Trakhan of Gilgit, Joshua son of Nun, and others \nincluding conceptually at least Jesus. Most were based on the \nancient myth of the Goddess Cunti (Kali-the-cosmic-yoni), who gave \nbirth to the sun god and placed him in a basket of rushes on the river \nGanges. The same sun god was reborn in Athens, fathered by Apollo \non the virgin Creusa, and left in a woven basket. 5 \n\nMoses\'s miracles were equally derivative, drawn chiefly from \nEgyptian myths. The drying up of a body of water, to cross dry-shod, \nwas a miracle of Isis, who parted the waters of the river Phaedrus on her \njourney to Byblos. 6 The same tale was told of Bindumati (Kali as \nmother of the bindu or Spark of Life) when she crossed the Ganges. \nMoses\'s extraction of water from a rock was performed long before \nby a guru at Lhasa; his rock is still called "the water of the god\'s \nvessel." 7 Atalanta of Calydon also brought forth water from a rock by \nstriking it with her spear and calling on her Goddess. 8 Mother Rhea \nperformed the same miracle; and she was also the giver of law tablets \non a holy mountain. \n\nThe historical basis of Moses myths seems to have been the \nexpulsion of Jews from Egypt during an outbreak of "pestilence," \npossibly leprosy. The historian Choeremen said the oracles blamed the \ninfection on foreign workers called Children of Israel. The priest \nManetho said in the 3rd century b.c. that alien tribes in northwestern \nEgypt were lepers and unclean. Lysimachus stated that the oracle of \nAmon ordered the alien workers to be collected and driven out of \nEgypt. 9 \n\nTacitus\'s account called the Jews "a race detested by the gods," \nwhose presence in Egypt was responsible for an outbreak of disfigur- \ning disease. The offenders were evicted from Egypt and sent into the \ndesert: \n\n\n\n676 \n\n\n\nThe people, who had been collected after diligent search, finding them- Moses \n\nselves left in a desert, sat for the most part in a stupor of grief, till one of \n\nthe exiles, Moyses by name, warned them not to look for any relief from \n\ngod or man, forsaken as they were of both, but to trust to themselves, ^^^^^^^m \n\ntaking for their heaven-sent leader that man who should first help them to \n\nbe quit of their present misery. They agreed, and in utter ignorance \n\nbegan to advance at random. Nothing, however, distressed them so much \n\nas the scarcity of water, and they had sunk ready to perish in all \n\ndirections over the plain, when a herd of wild asses was seen to retire from \n\ntheir pasture to a rock shaded by trees. Moyses followed them, and, \n\nguided by the appearance of a grassy spot, discovered an abundant spring \n\nof water. This furnished relief. After a continuous journey for six days, \n\non the seventh day they possessed themselves of a country, from which \n\nthey expelled the inhabitants, and in which they founded a city and a \n\ntemple. l0 \n\nJewish history begins with this expulsion from Egypt. Every- \nthing previous to this in the Bible was syncretic mythology gathered \nfrom non-Jewish sources. 11 Moses\'s encounter with the god of \npinai the Chaldean moon-god Sin shows that the Jews tried to settle \nn this god\'s territory, the Cainite-Midianite mining community on \nhe Sinai peninsula. \n\nThe whole peninsula was the Land of Sinim, i.e., "Land of the \nVloon." Its god Sin was a consort of Mother Inanna, or Nanna, who \ninnually turned the waters of Sumer into blood. Sin dwelt in a holy \nnountain, which Moses climbed, and Moses reported that he was the \name as the god of Abraham, though Abraham didn\'t know him by the \name name (Exodus 6:3). In very ancient documents, the name of \nAbraham himself appeared as a synonym for Ab-Sin, "Moon-father." 12 \n\nThe "God of Abraham" whose name meant Father Brahm \nntroduced himself to Moses as "I Am That I Am," in imitation of \nle Brahmanic Tat sat, "I Am That that Is." 1? (See Tetragramma- \non.) The god also commanded, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, \nar the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5). This \n/as an ancient Hindu custom. In India it is still proper to go barefoot \ni temple precincts, on the theory that subtle emanations from the holy \nround can enter the body through the feet. Ancient Egyptians and \nloman witches had the same custom. 14 \n\nAnother Brahma-like habit of Moses\'s god was to view a thousand \nears of man as one day in his own sight (Psalms 90:4). This was \nrapied from the "Day of Brahma" made up of a thousand years, or \npmetimes a thousand mahayugas or "great aeons." 15 \n\nThe stone tablets of law supposedly given to Moses were copied \nfom the Canaanite god Baal-Berith, "God of the Covenant." Their \n[en Commandments were similar to the commandments of the Bud- \nhist Decalogue. 16 In the ancient world, laws generally came from a \neity on a mountaintop. Zoroaster received the tablets of law from \nLhura Mazda on a mountaintop. 17 An earlier lawgiving mountain- \neity was Mother Rhea of Mount Dicte, or Ninhursag, probably a \n\n\n\n677 \n\n\n\nMoses model for the masculine lawgivers. Moses\'s god provided laws re- \n\nmarkably similar to those handed down from the Babylonian god to \n^^^^^^^^^^^ King Hammurabi. 18 \n\nMoses took over another matriarchal myth in the tale of the \nplagues of Egypt. This came from the third-dynasty reign of Tcheser \' \n(or Joser, whom the Hebrews called Joseph). The Nile flood failed for \nseven years, and Egyptians starved to death by thousands. The \npharaoh sent a desperate message to Mater (Mother), ruler of Nubia, to \nask how the Goddess might be propitiated. Mater\'s reply described \n"the couch of the Nile," a double cavern called Qerti or Khert, the \nunderworld, likened to "two breasts from which all good things \npoured forth." I9 Mater said the trouble was caused by a jealous male \ngod, who wished to be called "father of gods" and to hold the Key of \nthe Nile. As usual, the god\'s practical demands boiled down to gifts and \ntithes for his priesthood. \n\nWhen the story was written down many centuries afterward, in the \nlate Ptolemaic period, priests of Ra pretended their god had ended \nthe drought, by spreading a "red beer" over Egypt\'s fields to distract the \nattention of Mother Hathor, who was killing the people. 20 This \n"beer" was said to be "as human blood." What transformed it into \nblood was a holy substance from the Nile\'s source, called dedi. 21 This \nwas sometimes said to be a salty red earth, like ochre, likened to \nmenstrual blood. Or again, the red color was pomegranate juice, \nanother symbol of menstrual blood. 22 The pomegranate represented the \nvulva in biblical times, and was worshipped as an emblem of the \nGoddess on her holy mount Rimmon ("Pomegranate"). 23 \n\nWhat really turned the Nile into blood was not Moses\'s magic \nwand, but the red silt of flood time, supposed to be the Goddess\'s life- \ngiving uterine blood bathing the land in the substance of life. The \nmythic killing probably referred to hecatombs of firstborn sons, sacri- j \nficed in the attempt to end the drought, their blood spread on the \nfields to encourage the flood by sympathetic magic. See Firstborn. \n\nMoses\'s followers pretended that Yahweh had caused the slaughter \nof Egyptian firstborn sons (Exodus 12:29), while the Israelites were \npermitted to redeem their sons with the blood of lambs (Exodus 13:15). \nHowever, Yahweh had long copied the Egyptian custom of firstborn- \nsacrifice. He said, "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever \nopeneth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of \nbeast; it is mine" (Exodus 13:2). Like early Egyptian gods, Yahweh \nforgave sins only when his altars were soaked in blood: "without \nshedding of blood there is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22). \n\nThe Lord rather unnecessarily told Moses to instruct his people to \nsmear sacrificial blood on their doorposts, a custom that would have \nbeen perfectly familiar to any people living in Egypt where it was done \nat most religious festivals since the earliest times. Again it seems to \nhave originated in the Far East. At New Year sacrifices in China, \ndoorposts were smeared with blood of sacrificial lambs just as in the \n\n\n\n678 \n\n\n\nA \n\n\n\nPassover myth. 24 Upper Nigerian tribes still sacrifice to ancestral ghosts Mot \n\non the threshold of the house and smear the blood on doorposts. 25 Mother Carey \n\nMany laymen are still led to believe that a real Moses wrote the ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nPentateuch (first five books of the Old Testament), even though \nscholars have known for a long time that these books were first written \nin the late post-exilic period by priestly scribes in Jerusalem. 26 Their \npurpose was to create a mythic history for their nation out of customs, \nsayings, and legends mostly borrowed from others. The figure of \nMoses remains mysterious because it was largely a framework of myth \nhung on a non-Jewish name. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 151, 161. 2. Gray, 55. 3. Graves, G.M. 2, 190. \n4.

In other words, he was \nthe vegetation-god in the fallow season. \n\nLike the dying Jesus, Mot was "forsaken" by his heavenly Father \n(El) and symbolically castrated by the breaking of his reed scepter. \nLike the harvested grain, he was cut with a sickle, beaten with a flail, \nground in a mill, and scattered in pieces over the fields by his \nGoddess, Anat (Anatha). He was also assimilated to the pre-Christian \nfigure of the Lamb of God, calling himself the sacrificial lamb made \nready with pure wheat to atone for the sins of the people. 1 After each of \nhis annual ceremonial "deaths" he was always resurrected by the \nGoddess, who caused him to be reborn as the new crop, Aleyin. He was \nworshipped in Babylon and also in Jerusalem under the name of \nTammuz. \n\n1 .

Potter & Sargent, 71, 117. \n\n\n\n679 \n\n\n\nMotherhood Motherhood \n\n\n\nDuring the early evolution of the human race, motherhood was the \nonly recognized bond of relationship. Like any mammalian family, the \nprimitive human family consisted of mother and offspring. \n\nThe animal family is the product of the maternal instincts and of those \nalone; the mother is the sole centre and bond of it. . . . The male has no \nshare in forming the animal family; he is not an essential member of it; he \nmay join the maternal group, but commonly does not do so. When he \nattaches himself to the animal family his association with it is loose and \nprecarious. . . . Where the female can derive no benefit from associa- \ntion with the male, no such association takes place. Where male \ncooperation is useful, the male seeks out or follows the female, and it is \nthe latter who determines the segregation of the group and selects its \nabode.\' \n\nThe root of civilization was the kinship bond that kept groups \ntogether to evolve mutual cooperation. The bond was maternal because \nno paternal relationships were perceived, or even guessed, by such \nearly groups with their shifting, temporary sexual attachments. "The \nconnection between sexuality and childbearing was unknown to \nprimitive men." 2 \n\nPeople in primitive circumstances still show ignorance of the \nconnection between sexuality and childbearing. Trobriand Islanders \nattributed pregnancy to spirits, not sex. A woman\'s husband might help \ncare for her children, but he thought of them as "the children of my \nwife." The islanders laughed at white men who first tried to tell them \nabout impregnation. Chukchi female shamans said they made their \nchildren by their sacred stones, not by intercourse with men. Australian \naborigines thought women became pregnant by eating some special \nfoods, or by embracing a sacred tree hung with umbilical cords from \nprevious births. Bataks believed no woman could become pregnant \nunless umbilical cords and placentae were buried under her house. 3 \n\nPrimitives not only attributed pregnancy to a variety of causes, but \nalso assigned to it a variety of different durations, showing that they \nwere not sure when it began. 4 Most authorities now agree that not only \nthe uncivilized races today, but certainly all the world\'s people in the \nprehistoric period, knew nothing of man\'s part in the process of \nreproduction. It was believed that only women held the divine power \nto give life. 5 All the most ancient mythologies speak of a Creatress rather \nthan a Creator because living things could be made only by a female, \naccording to primitive beliefs. Men believed themselves unnecessary to 1 \nthe process. 6 \n\nThe most primitive hunting cultures have legends of still earlier \nages, when women possessed all magical arts and men had none. As \nchildbearers and nurturers, women took charge of growing things \ngenerally. They became the producers, storers, and distributors of \nvegetable foodstuffs, hence the owners of the land they used for cultiva- \ntion. They made the earth valuable and equated it with themselves. \n\n\n\n680 \n\n\n\nTheir economic and social power thus evolved the early village commu- Motherhood \n\nnities in matriarchal form. The men saw themselves as almost entirely \n\nsuperfluous, except for the labor they could contribute as hunters or ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ndefenders of the matriarchal group. 7 \n\nThe secret of fatherhood can only have been revealed to men by \nthe women themselves, because women were the keepers of calendri- \ncal records, another traditionally female skill that most men thought \nj beyond their comprehension. Before the advent of monogamous \nmarriage, a late development in human history, there would have been \nno reason or inclination to correlate copulations with births. Even if \n[ the truth were suspected, there were many negative cases to disprove it: \ni some women could copulate frequently and never become pregnant, \nI others could remain "barren" when living with one man but conceive \nI when living with another. Women past menopause or before menar- \nche could take any number of lovers without conceiving, which tended \nto suggest that menstruation was the crucial factor rather than sexual \nactivity. \n\nAs may be found still in many groups of people, motherhood alone \nwas the foundation of clan loyalties. In Assam, the social unit of tribes \njwas maharis, "motherhoods." The Malay family was a sa-mandei, \n"motherhood." Among the Garos and Khasis, mothers headed the \nfamily groups and bequeathed all property in the female line; men could \ninherit nothing. Nearly everywhere, kinship bonds also passed only \nthrough the female line, as in the ancient system deliberately reversed \nSby the Bible\'s "begats," which recognized only male ancestors. Seri \nIndian tribes called themselves Kunkak, "womanhood," or "mother- \niihood." 8 The earliest religious works of art "are figures of the solitary \nGreat Goddess the Paleolithic image of Mother, before there was any \niFather either on earth or in heaven." 9 The idea of fatherhood was \nblien to the religious or social thinking of the earliest civilizations. 10 \n\n"Home and mother" are written over every phase of neolithic agricul- \nture. . . . It was the woman who wielded the digging stick and the hoe; \nshe who tended the garden crops and accomplished those masterpieces of \nselection and cross-fertilization which turned raw wild species into the \nprolific and richly nutritious domestic varieties: it was woman who made \nthe first containers, weaving baskets and coiling the first clay pots. . . . \nIn form, the village, too, is her creation: for whatever else the village might \nbe, it was a collective nest for the care and nurture of the young. Here \nshe lengthened the period of child-care and playful irresponsibility, on \nwhich so much of man \'s higher development depends. House and \nvillage, eventually the town itself, are woman writ large. In Egyptian \nhieroglyphics, "house" or "town" may stand as symbols for "mother," \nas if to confirm the similarity of the individual and the collective nurturing \nfunction. In line with this, the more primitive structures houses, \nrooms, tombs are usually round ones: like the original bowl described in \nGreek myth, which was modeled on Aphrodite\'s breast. " \n\nAncient civilizations show ample evidence of the matriarchal \nmatrix in which they grew. Egyptians traced their descent through \n\n681 \n\n\n\nMotherhood mothers, calling themselves "X, born of the Lady Y," omitting their \n\nfather\'s name. 12 On Egyptian funerary stelae, the mother\'s name was \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ given but the father\'s was omitted. 13 Diodorus said Egyptian queens \nreceived more respect than kings. 14 In the Ramesseum, the queen \nmother was addressed as "mighty mistress of the world." 15 Pharaohs \nruled by matrilineal succession, and styled themselves "Rulers from the \nWomb." 16 The name of the Goddess was always a component part \nof royal names in the earliest dynasties. A pharaoh\'s title was originally \nper aa, Great Gate or Great House, symbol of the cosmic womb. \nRulers of the Egyptians\' Nubian neighbors had an even more mother- \ncentered title: Mater. 17 \n\nEgyptian men were awed by maternal behavior patterns, won- \ndering why women did what they did to maintain the race. Maxims \nwritten about 1500 B.C. said: \n\nThou shalt never forget thy mother and what she has done for thee. \n. . . For she carried thee long beneath her heart as a heavy burden, and \nafter thy months were accomplished she bore thee. Three long years \nshe carried thee upon her shoulder and gave thee her breast to thy mouth, \nand as thy size increased her heart never once allowed her to say, \n"Why should I do this?" > 8 \n\nEgyptian scriptures emphasized the honor due "thy mother, \nwho bore thee with much suffering. She placed thee in the Chamber of \nInstruction that thou mightest acquire instruction in books. She was \nunremitting in her care for thee, and had loaves and beer for thee in her \nhouse. When thou art grown . . . cast thine eyes upon her that gave \nthee birth and provided all good things for thee, thy mother. Let her \nnever reproach thee." 19 \n\nAn Ethiopian woman expressed to Frobenius the basic psychologi- \ncal attitude of primitive mothers: \n\nHow can a man know what a woman \'s life is? . . . The man spends a night \nby a woman and goes away. His life and body are always the same. The \nwoman conceives. As a mother she is another person from the woman \nwithout child. She carries the fruit of the night nine months long in her \nbody. Something grows. Something grows into her life that never again \ndeparts from it. She is a mother. She is and remains a mother even \nthough her child die, though all her children die. For at one time she \ncarried the child under her heart. And it does not go out of her heart \never again. Not even when it is dead. All this the man does not know; he \nknows nothing. He does not know the difference before love and after \nlove, before motherhood and after motherhood. He can know nothing. \nOnly a woman can know that and speak of that. That is why we won \'t \nbe told what to do by our husbands. 20 \n\nIn Old Iranian, the head of a clan or family was the hana, \n"grandmother." Among the Medes, genealogies were based on the \nfemale line. In Babylon, the ideogram for "mother" combined the \nelements of "house" and "deity," like the Hindu grhadevata or "house- \ngoddess." The female sex received precedence in all forms of \n\n\n\n682 \n\n\n\naddress. The descending order of beings began with "Goddess and Motherhood \n\ngods, women and men." 21 By Babylonian law, "any sin against the \n\nmother, any repudiation against the mother was punished by banish- ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nment from the community." The Lycians too kept track of female \n\nancestors only. Heraclides Ponticus said of them, "From of old they \n\nhave been ruled by the women." 22 Phoenicians wrote of recent past \n\nwhen people didn\'t know their fathers, but took the names of their \n\nmothers. 25 \n\nEtruscan tomb inscriptions also disregarded fathers. When married \n\ncouples were buried together, only the wife\'s name was written. Late \nj Roman texts reversed this usage, writing the name of the husband and \n\nomitting that of the wife. 24 But before the founding of Rome, Italy \n\nwas governed by the Sabine matriarchate, when not even kings knew \nI their fathers. Romulus, Ancus Marcus, and Servius Tullius had only \n! mothers. Indeed, fatherhood was not always noticed even in the classical \n\nperiod; Roman plebeians didn\'t know their fathers. When the myth \njof Romulus and his men was written down, it was said Romulus made \nj his followers marry Sabine women, because, as men, they lacked \n\\ sanguis ac genus, the blood of the race. 25 This could come only from \n\nthe female owners of the land. \n\nPatriarchal writers claimed that Romulus named each of the early \n\nRoman curiae (clans) after one of the Sabine women. 26 The story \n[was invented to disguise the fact that these curiae were "motherhoods," \n[bearing the names of maternal ancestresses. 27 The mother of all clans \nDwas Juno Curitis, the Queen of Heaven whom the Romans adopted \nland presented with a new spouse, Jupiter. 28 \n\nAmong barbarian tribes of northern Europe, women were proper- \nIty owners, clan heads, and religious leaders. Roman writers called the \n[(northern nations "lands of women" governed by kvaens (queens). 29 \nHPrehistoric Irish queens were mentioned in old writings, but their \n\'spouses were left nameless. The Lombards claimed their ancestors \n[descended from a primal virgin mother, Gambara, who had no \n|spouse. Mothers, not fathers, gave their names to children in pagan \n[\'Britain and Scandinavia. Old German documents designate persons \ni by their mothers\' names only. 30 \n\nIt was the same in the Far East. Chinese family names are always \n[formed from a sign meaning "woman." The custom is said to date \n[from a past time when people knew their mothers but not their \nbathers. 51 The Man-Tseu of southern China had a system of heredi- \ntary queenship passing through a sacred female clan. 32 Chinese writings \n\ncall Tibet "the land of women" and Japan "the land of queens." \nJapanese imperial families traced their descent from the supreme sun \ni goddess, Omikami Amaterasu, mother of the world. Japanese legend- \nlary "chiefs" of ancestral tribes were usually women. 33 \n\nThe Chinese said the first man to understand fatherhood and \n[institute monogamous marriage was Fu-Hi who, however, had no \nMather but only a mother. 34 The same first discoverer of paternity in \n\n\n\n683 \n\n\n\nMotherhood Greek myth was Cecrops, a high priest of Athene and one of her \n\nserpent-consorts. 55 Athene however was a name of the Aegean Great \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ ^ Goddess and Universal Mother, who ruled alone and supreme \n\nduring the Bronze Age. 56 In the whole Aegean area, religious rites were \nin the hands of priestesses, regarded as emanations or embodiments \nof the Goddess, who was simply woman deified, as the later God was \nman deified. Men didn\'t participate in public worship until a fairly \nlate date, then only as priestesses\' helpers, as the male deity was \nsubordinate to the female. 57 \n\nIn Europe also, the Great Goddess was thought the sole omnipo- \ntent deity. Fatherhood was not incorporated into religious thinking, \nbecause in clan life it was a very frail bond, even if recognized. 58 \nScholars know that "in the beginning the Goddess everywhere \nantedated, or at least was predominant over, the God. It has been \naffirmed that in all countries from the Euphrates to the Adriatic, the \nChief Divinity was at first in woman form." 59 \n\nRecent researches into the history of the family render it in the highest \ndegree improbable that the physical kinship between the god and his \n[sic] worshippers, of which traces are found all over the Semitic area, was \noriginally conceived as fatherhood. It was the mother\'s, not the father\'s \nblood which formed the original bond of kinship among the Semites as \namong other early people and in this stage of society, if the tribal deity \nwas thought of as the parent of the stock, a goddess, not a god, would \nnecessarily have been the object of worship. * \n\nModern male scholars often tried to conceal or deny the \nevidence of the ancient matriarchate. Whenever possible, some auto- \nmatically converted references to the Great Mother into the word \n"God," as was done in translating the Bible. Even so responsible a \nscholar as Cumont, translating Apuleius\'s description of the Syrian \nGoddess as omnipotens et omniparens, "all-powerful and all-produc- \ning," glossed the description as a "conception of the absolute, \nunlimited authority of God [sic] over the earth." 41 \n\nFrankfort said the Goddess was supreme in Mesopotamia \n"because the source of all life is seen in the female." Saggs said she \nwas "the central figure in Neolithic religion." 42 In Egypt, she was "the I \nBeing eternal and infinite, the creative and ruling power of heaven, \nearth, and the underworld, and of every creature and thing in them. . . .1 \nMother-goddess, lady of heaven, queen of the gods . . . who raised up \nTern in primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and \nwho created that which exists . . . the greatest power on earth, who \ncommandest all that is in the universe, and who preservest all the gods \n\n... the God-mother, giver of life All that has been, that is, and that \n\nwill be." 45 \n\nBesides creating the world and everything in it, the Goddess \ncreated the civilized arts: agriculture, building, weaving, potting, \nwriting, poetry, music, the graphic arts, calendars, and mathematics. \nThese seem to have developed mostly in the hands of women as \n\n\n\n684 \n\n\n\noutgrowths of the maternal nest-building, communication, and play Motherhood \n\nbehavior. "Woman was the creator of the primordial elements of \n\ncivilization [A]ll the richer perceptions and interpretations that color ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe actualities of life, all art, all poetic sentiment, are irradiations of ^^^^^^^^ \n\nthose extra-individualistic, racial interests which are represented by the \n\nreproductive instincts, and are the dominant interests of the female. \n\nThey have their source in the race-regarding feminine impulses." 44 \nHindu scriptures say the Goddess invented alphabets, pictographs, \n\nmandalas and other magical signs, hence her title of Samjna (sign, \n\nname, image). The Brahmavaivarta Purana says under another of her \n[titles, Savitri, the Goddess gave birth to the Vedas, the rhythms of the \n\nRagas, day and night, the year, the month, the seasons, the inch, the \n\nsecond, and all other units of measurement; also logic, grammar, the \n[days of the week, Time, Death, Nourishment, Memory, Victory, \ni religious rituals, the trinity of aeons, and all the gods. 45 \n\nAs Great Mother Kali Ma, she wore on her necklace of skulls the \n; sacred Sanskrit letters, which she invented, and invested with such \n\nmagic power that she could create things simply by pronouncing their \nnames in this language. 46 The notion led to the Neoplatonic, and \nlater Christian, concept of the Creative Word or Logos. \n\nSanskrit matra, like the Greek meter, meant both "mother" and \n"measurement." Mathematics is, by derivation, "mother-wisdom." \nRoot words for motherhood produced many words for calculation: \nmetric, mensuration, mete, mens, mark, mentality; geo-metry, tri- \ngono-metry, hydro-metry, etc. Women did temporal and spatial \ncalculations for so long that, according to the Vayu Purana, men \nonce thought women were able to give birth because they had superior \nskill in measuring and figuring. Men imagined that if they could \nmaster these feminine skills, they could give birth, too. "Male ances- \ntors" told one another that if they could only learn to measure the \nearth, they would "happily create progeny." 47 \n\nIn the Middle East also, numbers and letters were inventions of \nthe Goddess and the special concern of her priestesses. Ashurbanipal \nproudly declared that he was the first Babylonian king to learn "the \nnoble art of tablet- writing," which belonged to the special scribes \ncalled maryanu.** A similar Egyptian word for a scribe was Maryen or \nMahir, "great one" or "mother." 49 No one was permitted to enter \nthe Holy of Holies in Babylon\'s municipal temple except women who \nhad given birth; thus it seems likely that the maryanu were originally \nmothers, dedicated to the Semitic Goddess Mari-Anna, otherwise \nknown as Ishtar. 50 Among the Hittites, priestesses known as Elderly \nWomen taught the art of writing, kept records, advised kings, and \npracticed medicine. 51 The Triple Goddess of Fate was incarnate in \nthree Guises or "writers," corresponding to the Germanic Fates called \nDie Schreiberinnen, the Writing- Women, and the Roman mother of \ndestiny Fata Scribunda, "the Fate who writes." 52 \n\nIn pre-Hellenic Greece the alphabet was attributed to the original \n\n\n\n685 \n\n\n\nMotherhood three Muses, who were identical with the Fates or Graeae, epony- \n\nmous mothers of Greek tribes. The Latin alphabet was created by the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ archaic Goddess Carmenta, mother of carmens or "charms." Or, \n\naccording to Isidore of Seville, the alphabet was created by the Moon- i \ngoddess Io under her Egyptian name of Isis. 5J \n\nEgyptians revered the Goddess as measurer of time, mistress of \nthe house of books, mistress of the house of architects. 54 As foundress of \nthe science of architecture she was named Seshat, "Lady of the \nBuilder\'s Measure." She built "the abode of a king in the next world," a \npyramid. She also created the Golden Calf, Horus, familiar in the \nBible as the idol worshipped by Aaron and the Israelites. 55 \n\nAncient beliefs linking motherhood with superior intelligence, \nreasoning power, and magical knowledge made it hard for men to \noppose the matriarchate, even when they discovered paternity and \npersonified it in gods. Fathers\' claim to children\'s respect seemed \nrelatively trivial by comparison with the mothers\' gestation, birth-giving, \nnursing, supporting, and daily teaching. The Book of Maccabees said \na mother\'s sympathy with her children is deeper than a father\'s. 56 The \nMahanirvanatantra said, "Mother is superior to father on account of \nher bearing and also nourishing the child." 57 Menander wrote, "A \nmother loves her child more than a father does." 58 Therefore the \nchild is more hers than his; as the old Irish proverb put it, "To every \ncow belongs her calf." 59 The Laws of Manu stated that "A spiritual \nteacher exceeds a worldly teacher ten times, a father exceeds a spiritual \nteacher one hundred times, but a mother exceeds one thousand times \na father\'s claim to honor on the part of a child and as its educator." 60 \n\nThere may have been a real biological advantage underlying \nancient views of the female\'s superior intelligence. As mothers or \npotential mothers, female mammals have more need of naturally \nresponsive alertness than males. "Girls\' more mature skills enable \nthem to attend to stimuli, especially from other people, more swiftly and \naccurately than boys. Girls are better at analyzing and anticipating \nenvironmental demands; in addition, they have greater verbal facility. \n. . . The perceptual, cognitive, and verbal skills which for unknown \nreasons are more characteristic of girls enable them to analyze and \nanticipate adult demands." 61 As a modern woman said, "After the birth < \nof children that enormous thing you do everything else seems \nkind of a breeze. But so many of us lock the doors of the mind. We nev- \ner bother to penetrate below the surface of that bottomless sea of \nresources that may be nature\'s gift to women." 62 \n\nFor a long time men feared to oppose women because they were \nconvinced women were more closely allied with the forces of nature. \nWest African tribesmen testified that "women were more powerful than \nmen, for to them alone the mysteries of the gods and of secret things \nwere known." Women founded the magical Egbo society, but after \nmen learned the secret rites, they kept women from participating any \nmore. In Queensland also, once men learned magic, they forbade \n\n\n\n686 \n\n\n\nwomen to practice, on the ground that women had too much natural Motherhood \n\naptitude for it. 63 \n\nIn northern Europe, the Vanir or Elder Gods, led by Mother ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nEarth and the Goddess Freya, were overthrown by new patriarchal \ndeities from Asia, the Aesir led by Father Odin. In the Aegean, \nfollowers of Father Zeus fought the pre-Hellenic worshippers of \nMother Rhea or Hera. In Babylon, worshippers of Marduk rebelled \nagainst the primal mother Tiamat, whose own son killed her to take \nDver her world-creating function. In Mexico, the legendary leader of the \n\\ztecs overthrew his sister Malinalxochitl, former ruler of men and \nDeasts, afterward described as "a bad witch." 64 \n\nIn Australia, the Goddess named Marm (Mother) was diabolized \n>y men who resented the advantages she bestowed on women. She \nnade women in her own image, and gave them "magic fruit" (off- \nspring) that she denied to men. 65 In Malekula, men frankly admitted \n:hat their religious rites were stolen from the women, who invented \n[hem but ceased to practice them. 66 Tierra del Fuegan men said \nvomen used to rule the world by witchcraft, and all religious mysteries \npelonged to their Goddess, the moon. 67 Men adopted the cult of the \n^un god, and under his leadership they murdered all the adult women of \nthe tribe, leaving only immature girls not yet initiated. 68 \n\nA transparently mendacious Iatmul legend said women invented \nacred objects and secrets of magic, then "gave" these things to men, \nand "asked" the men to murder them so no woman would have the \nsecrets any more. 69 Many similar examples show that the defeat of \nhe matriarchate was mythologized as a violent attack of men upon \nvomen. Such myths of leadership forcibly wrested from women \n>ccur throughout the world and cannot be overlooked. 70 As Engels \nloted, "The overthrow of mother-right was the world-historical \nlownfall of the female sex." 71 \n\nIn some ways, it may have meant the downfall of all humanity \nrom a basically peaceful social order to a hierarchical structure \nstablished and maintained by aggression.
