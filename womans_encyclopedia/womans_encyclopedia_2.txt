53 Sometimes, the men\'s severed members were \nthrown into houses, as a special blessing. In return, householders gave \nthe new eunuchs feminine garments to wear. Sometimes, the severed \ngenitalia were carried in baskets or cistae to the Mother\'s innermost \nshrine, where they were anointed, even gilded, and solemnly buried in \nthe Bridal Chamber. 34 The phallus of the god himself was carried \ninto the sacred cavern in the form of a large pine log, which was also, \nlike the phallic cross of Middle-Eastern saviors, the instrument on \nwhich he died. 35 His priests, having copied his self-sacrifice, were \ndistinguished by the androgynous title bestowed on the earliest forms \nof Shiva; they were "lords who were half woman." 36 \n\nTertullian admitted that the "divine mysteries" of Christianity \nwere virtually the same as the "devilish mysteries" of pagan saviors \nlike Attis. 37 Popularity of Attis\'s cult in Rome led to Christian adoption \nof some of the older god\'s ways. One of the best-kept secrets of early \nChristianity was its preaching of castration for the special inner circle of \ninitiates, who won extra grace with this demonstration of chastity. \nThey taught, following the Wisdom of Solomon, "Blessed is the \neunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity." 38 Jesus \nhimself advocated castration: "There be eunuchs, which have made \nthemselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\'s sake. He that is able \nto receive it, let him receive it" (Matthew 19:12). \n\nSeveral early fathers of the church did receive it. Origen was highly \npraised for having castrated himself. 39 Justin\'s Apologia said proudly \nthat Roman surgeons were besieged by faithful Christian men request- \ning the operation. Tertullian declared, "The kingdom of heaven is \nthrown open to eunuchs." 40 Justin advised that Christian boys be \nemasculated before puberty, so their virtue was permanently protect- \ned. 41 Three Christians who tried to burn Diocletian\'s palace were \ndescribed as eunuchs. 42 \n\nThroughout the middle ages, cathedral choirs included castrati, \nemasculated before puberty to preserve their virtue and their soprano \nvoices, which were considered more pleasing to God than the "impure" \nfemale soprano. Women were not allowed to sing in church choirs, \nanyway. \n\nCastration was advocated also for monks who could not fend off \nthe demons of sexual desire. It was forcibly imposed on the monk \nAbelard, whose love affair with his pupil Heloise caused a scandal in the \nchurch. But there were others who seem to have accepted surgical \nchastity on a voluntary basis. Such men assumed the title of Hesychasti, \n"permanently chaste ones," or "those who are at peace." The title \n\n\n\n146 \n\n\n\nwas associated particularly with the monks of Mount Athos, so carefully \nascetic that even to the present day no female creature is allowed on \nthe holy mountain hens, cows, sows, nanny goats, and women all \nequally forbidden. 43 \n\nIt is likely that Mount Athos was named after Attis, and may have \nbeen a shrine served by his eunuch priests in pre-Christian times, \nsituated close to his Phrygian home. There was a Magna Mater figure \nconnected with Mount Athos up to the early 14th century. The \nmonks were labeled heretics for being too deeply involved with the \nteachings of a certain so-called nun named Irene "Peace," the \nthird persona of Triple Aphrodite embodied in her priestess-Horae. \nIrene, as Crone, would have been the priestess of castrations hinted \nin the myths of such lovers of the Goddess as Anchises and Adonis. 44 \nWhen the church purged Mount Athos of the influence of Irene, the \nabbot Lazarus was expelled. With a companion named Barefooted \nCyril, Lazarus wandered through Bulgaria preaching the redeeming \nvirtues of nakedness and self-emasculation. 45 \n\nIt seems the cult of Attis and Cybele continued to influence \nChristianity in the Balkans for many centuries. Balkan monastic \ncommunities were organized in groups of fifty, like older "colleges" of \nthe Great Mother\'s castrated priests. In Thrace, the Great Mother \nhad the name of Cottyto, mother of the hundred-handed giant Cottus, \nan allegorical figure representing her fifty spiritual sons with two \nhands each. 46 Her worship persisted underground, long enough for the \nchurch to define it as witchcraft, and to label Cottyto a demon. In \n1619 a booklet published in Paris suggested the same Balkan tradition of \nthe priest who dedicated himself to God in a manner that was then \nconsidered heretical: "the devil cut off his privy parts." 47 \n\nRitual castration was again revived by 1 8th-century Russian secta- \nries calling themselves Skoptsi, "castrated ones." 48 They also called \nthemselves People of God, insisting that removal of their genitals \nbrought them profound spiritual powers. Russia\'s "mad monk" \nRasputin was a member of this sect. 49 Since Rasputin was famed for his \naffairs with women, few of his contemporaries would Jiave believed \nhim a eunuch; but they had forgotten what eastern harem-keepers knew \nwell enough: that eunuchs are quite capable of providing women \nwith sexual pleasure. Rasputin\'s hold over his female devotees was in \nany case a curious combination of spiritual and sensual obsession. \n\nl.Budge,G.E.2,89,100. 2. G.R.Scott, 192-93. 3.Hays,412. 4.

Like everything else associated with \nwitchcraft, this idea dated back to ancient Goddess-worship. \n\nThe Teutonic Mother Freya rode in a chariot drawn by cats. 1 \nArtemis-Diana often appeared in cat form, and was identified with \nthe Egyptian cat-goddess Bast. The willow sacred to Hecate became a \npussy-willow that bore "catkins" in the spring. 2 \n\nCat worship began in Egypt, where the first domesticated cats \ndescended from a wild ancestor, felis hbyca? Plutarch said the cat was \ncarved on Isis\'s holy sistrum and represented the moon, "[i]ts activity in \nthe night, and the peculiar circumstances which attend its fecundity \nmaking it a proper emblem of that body. For it is reported of this \ncreature, that it at first brings forth one, then two, afterwards three, \nand so goes on adding one to each former birth till it comes to seven; so \nthat she brings forth twenty-eight in all, corresponding as it were to the \nseveral degrees of light, which appear during the moon\'s revolutions." 4 \n\nThe Egyptian word for cat was Mau, both an imitation of the cat\'s \ncry, and a mother-syllable. Cats were so sacred in Egypt that any man \nwho killed one was condemned to death. Diodorus, a first-century B.C. \nGreek historian, told of a foolish Roman who killed a cat in Egypt and \nwas slain in his own house by an infuriated mob. 5 \n\nBast, the Cat-mother of the city of Bubastis, was the benevolent \naspect of Hathor, the Lioness. Festivals of Bast were joyful with music, \ndancing, jokes, and sexual rites. 6 Her dark side was Hathor as the \nleonine Sphinx, Sekhmet (Greek Sakhmis), tearer and devourer of \nmen. 7 "By my life, when I slay men my heart rejoices," she said. Her \nfeast day commemorated a massacre once perpetrated by Sekhmet the \nGreat Cat. The Egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days noted for \nthis one, with inadvertent humor: "Hostile, hostile, hostile is the 12th \nTybi. Avoid seeing a mouse on this day." 8 \n\nMedieval belief in the cat\'s nine lives probably stemmed from the \nEgyptian Ennead, via the mythic figure of the Ninefold Goddess. It was \noften said any witch could assume a cat\'s shape nine times in her life. 9 \nShe could also assume the shape of a hare. 10 Frazer observed: "Cats are \nprecisely the animals into which, with the possible exception of hares, \nwitches were most usually supposed to transform themselves." n \n\nBrought to England, cats were confused with hares as the Moon- \ngoddess\'s totems. The root language of Sanskrit called the moon cacin, \n"that marked with the Hare," but some said the lunar animal might be a \ncat. 12 Queen Boadicea\'s banners bore the device of the moon-hare, \nwhich was also dedicated to the Saxon Goddess Eostre (Easter) at her \nrites of spring: hence the Easter Bunny. Irish peasants still observe the \nmatriarchal taboo on hare meat, saying to eat a hare is to eat one\'s \ngrandmother. 13 Both hares and cats had obviously yonic nicknames: \ncunny, pussy. A rabbit warren is still called a cunnary. 14 \n\n\n\n148 \n\n\n\nTo the Scots, the Goddess of Witches was Mither o\' the Mawkins. Catherine, Saint \n\n"Mawkin" or "malkm" was either a hare or a cat. 15 When the cat \n\nbecame the primary lunar animal, the traditional witch\'s familiar was ^_ ___ \n\nGreymalkin or Grimalkin, a "gray cat." Gray malkins were also the ^^^^^ \n\n"pussies" or "catkins" on the pussy willow, sacred to witches and \nheralding the pagan games of May. \n\nInquisitor Nicholas Remy said all cats were demons. In 1387, \nLombard witches were said to worship the devil as a cat. 16 Christians \nsometimes exposed cats to torture and fire along with witches. At certain \nfestivals, such as Midsummer, Easter, and Shrove Tuesday, it was \ncustomary to burn cats in wicker cages. "The cat, which represented the \ndevil, could never suffer enough." 17 According to Jewish belief, cats \nwere not made by God. The first pair of male and female cats were \n"snorted forth" from the nostrils of a lion on board Noah\'s ark. 18 \n\n1. Turville-Petre, 107; Branston, 133. 2. Graves, CM. 1,115. \n\n3. Encyc.

In the hearts of many people she was second only to the \nvirgin Mary. 1 Yet even Catholic scholars admit her legend is \n"preposterous." 2 \n\nThe key to the secret of St. Catherine is her so-called Catherine \nWheel, the wheel of fire on which she was said to have been \nmartyred. At Sinai, the original center of Catherine\'s cult, the Asiatic \nGoddess was once portrayed as the Dancer on the Fiery Wheel at \nthe hub of the universe. A Greek convent of priestess-nuns at Sinai in \nthe 8th century a.d. called themselves kathari, "pure ones," a word \nakin to the Kathakali temple-dancers of India, who performed the \nDance of Time in honor of Kali, Goddess of the karmic wheel. 5 \n\nThe symbol of the wheel figured prominently in beliefs of medi- \neval Gnostics who called themselves Cathari, and revered St. \nCatherine almost as a female counterpart of God. Perhaps for this \nreason, in the 1 5 th and 16th centuries, after the Cathari were \nexterminated, Catholic prelates made efforts to have St. Catherine \neliminated from the canon. 4 \n\nHer Christian myth made her the standard young beauty dedicated \nto virginity, and so wise she could demolish the arguments of fifty \nphilosophers at once. She refused the hand of the emperor in marriage, \nwhereupon he following the hagiographers\' usual curious pat- \ntern essayed to win her love by having her imprisoned and tortured. \nHer captors tried to break her on the fiery wheel, but the wheel was \n\n\n\n149 \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nshattered by a sudden bolt of lightning and she was saved. In the end, \nshe had to be beheaded. Milk flowed from her veins instead of blood. \nAngels carried her body from Alexandria to Sinai, where her relics were \n"discovered" 500 years later. 5 Her divine bones constantly exuded a \nhealing unguent, which was bottled and sold at great profit to the \nconvent. 6 \n\n1.

The Authorized \nVersion inaccurately \ntranslates sappur as \n"sapphire." 8 \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\nThe symbol commonly opposed to the cross, as the witches\' object \nof worship; in pagan tradition, the Great Mother\'s cosmic womb. As the \n"pot of blood in the hand of Kali," the cauldron signified cyclic \nrecurrence, as opposed to the patriarchal view of linear time. \n\nShakespeare followed the traditional pattern in associating the \ncauldron with three witches, since, from its earliest appearances in \nBronze Age and Iron Age cultures, the cauldron stood for the Triple \nGoddess of fate, or wyrd in Old English: the three Weird Sisters. 1 \n\nThe Egyptian hieroglyphic sign of the threefold Creatress, mother \nof the sun, the universe, and all the gods, was a design of three \ncauldrons. 2 The Norse god Odin stole his divine power from three \ncauldrons of Wise Blood in the cave-womb of the earth, where he \nentered in the shape of a phallic serpent and beguiled the earth-giantess \nby making love to her. 3 Then he drank the magic blood from the \ncauldrons and became a shape-shifter, turning himself into a bird to \ncarry the precious blood back to other gods. This myth was based on \nthat of the Aryan sky-god Indra, who also drank the Goddess\'s ambrosia \nfrom three cauldrons, the three wombs of Kali\'s trinity. 4 Indra stole \nthe elixir by allowing himself to be swallowed by a vast serpent \nrepresenting female sexuality (Kundalini). He too turned into a bird \nto carry the elixir to other gods. \n\nIn nearly all mythologies there is a miraculous vessel. Sometimes it \ndispenses youth and life, at other times it possesses the power of \nhealing, and occasionally, as with the mead cauldron of the Nordic Ymir, \ninspiring strength and wisdom are to be found in it. Often . . . it effects \ntransformations. s \n\nThe cauldron that effected transformations was the same as the \nwomb that churned out rebirths, changing shapes each time. In Babylon \nit was under the control of the Fate-goddess Siris, mother of stars. Her \ncauldron was the blue heaven, where she stirred the mead of \nregeneration. "Siris, the wise woman, the mother, who had done what \nwas necessary. Her cauldron is of shining lapis lazuli. Her tub is of \npure silver and gold. In mead stands jubilation, in mead sits rejoicing." 6 \n\nLapis lazuli was the blue heaven stone prized for its power to cause \nrebirth. The Papyrus of Nekhtu-Amen said an amulet of lapis lazuli \n\n\n\n150 \n\n\n\nstood for the heart (ab), source of mother-blood; therefore the amulet \nwas inserted into a mummy to generate a new heart for the \ndeceased. 7 \n\nChaldean cosmology saw the sky as a nesting of seven vessels, the \nplanetary spheres, like inverted bowls or cauldrons. Beneath the earth \nlay the mirror image of this celestial realm, seven more spheres some- \ntimes described as cauldrons. A Hittite myth called them the vessels \nof Mother Death, dark twin sister of the heavenly Mother Siris: "The \ndoorkeeper has opened the seven doors, has unlocked the seven bolts. \nDown in the dark earth there stand seven cauldrons, their lids oiabaru \nmetal, their handles of iron. Whatever goes in there comes not out \nagain." 9 \n\nEgyptians sometimes saw the seven-circled nether womb as a \nregenerative cauldron called the Lake of Fire. 10 The corresponding \ncelestial vessels were "above heaven." n But the divine cauldron also \nappeared right on earth, within the sacred precincts of the temple. \n\nKing Aeson was resurrected after being boiled in the cauldron of \nMedea, "Mead of Wisdom," eponymous mother goddess of the \nMedes. King Minos too was boiled in the Goddess\'s cauldron and \ndeified in Tartarus, where he became a judge and a Lord of Death. \nUnder the name of Demeter, the Goddess restored Pelops to life in her \ncauldron. 15 According to his inscription at Mount Hermon, the \nRoman emperor Elagabalus was likewise "deified in the cauldron." 16 \n\nSt. John the Evangelist was oddly assimilated to the pagan myth of \nthe regenerative cauldron. He was boiled in it and came forth livelier \nthan before. His symbols were a bleeding heart and a boiling cauldron. 17 \nThe syncretism of the "Feast of St. John at the Latin Gate" \neventually became too embarrassing, and the festival was expunged \nfrom the Christian calendar in I960. 18 The apocryphal St. George, \nhowever, continued to enter the cauldron as one of his alleged tortures. \nBy making the sign of the cross, he rendered it lukewarm and \nharmless, an example of a matriarchal symbol made subordinate to a \npatriarchal one. 19 \n\nAmong the Celts of Gaul and Britain, the Cauldron of Regen- \neration was the central religious mystery: reincarnation within the womb \nof the Goddess. The Irish who worshipped the threefold Morrigan \ncalled the second person of her trinity Badb, "Boiling," the producer of \nlife, wisdom, inspiration, and enlightenment. 20 \n\nTo Welsh bards she was the Goddess Branwen, "one of the three \nMatriarchs of the Island," owner of the Cauldron of Regeneration in \nwhich dead men could be resuscitated overnight. 21 As "a powerful fairy \nqueen," the Lady of the Lake of the Basin, she dwelt in a sacred lake \nfrom which her brother Bran the Blessed raised the cauldron later \nknown as the Holy Grail. 22 This pagan god was Christianized as \nBron, alleged brother-in-law of Joseph of Arimathea who was supposed \nto have brought the Grail to Britain. Actually, the Grail was well \nestablished in British paganism long before its legend was assimilated to \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nLarge cauldrons in \nEgyptian temples were \ncalled shi, the \nprototype of the brass \n"sea" in Solomon\'s \ntemple, which was \ncertainly a Cauldron \nof Regeneration. 12 \nBabylonian temples \nhad the same vessel, \ncalled apsu or \n"abyss," for baptism, \nceremonial lavage, \nand rebirth rituals." \nSuch a "sea" was \nalso called "the Deep," \ntehom in Hebrew.\' * \nLike the Christian \nbaptismal font \ndescended from these \nforerunners, the \ncauldron or "sea" was a \nwomb symbol. \nSolomon\'s "sea" \nrepresented his \nGoddess, Ashtoreth \n(Astarte). It was \ndecorated with her \nyonic lilies: "The \nbrim thereof was \nwrought like the \nbrim of a cup, with \nflowers of lilies" \n(1 Kings 7:26). \n\n\n\n151 \n\n\n\nCauldron that of Christ. 23 Branwen, Goddess of the Cauldron, had yet another \n\nincarnation in medieval romance as Brangwain, the wise-woman who \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m gave Tristan and Iseult their fatal love potion. 24 \n\nThe Goddess had earthly incarnations too. Childeric, son of \nMerovech or Merovig, founder of the first dynasty of French kings, \nmarried a druidess named Basina (Cauldron), who foretold the future of \nhis dynasty. 25 \n\nLike the "seas" in ancient temples, the Cauldron of Regeneration \nalso had its counterparts on earth. Each Celtic temple had its sacred \ncauldron. Aubrey\'s A Natural History of Surrey mentioned a pagan \ncauldron still preserved in Frensham Church, "an extraordinary great \nkettle or cauldron" brought by the fairies, according to local legend. 26 \nAn 8th-century Salic Law against priestesses or, as the church \ncalled them, witches prohibited the pagan practice of "bearing the \ncauldron" in procession to "the places where they cook." 27 \n\nThe Welsh bard Taliesin claimed to have received the mead of \nwisdom from his mother, the Goddess Cerridwen, "the Celtic Great \nMother, the Demeter." 28 \n\nShe resolved, according to the arts of the books ofFferyllt (Fairy-wisdom)., \nto boil a Cauldron of Inspiration and Science for her son . . . which \nfrom the beginning of its boiling might not cease to boil for a year and a \nday, until three blessed drops were obtained of the Grace of \nInspiration. 29 \n\nTaliesin\'s poetry contained oblique allusions to the magic caul- \ndron, couched in the semi-opaque terms that concealed mystical secrets \nfrom the uninitiated. His "year and a day" was a reference to the \nlunar calender of the pagans, a year of thirteen 28-day lunar months, \n364 days, with one more day to make 365. The same "year and a \nday" occurred in many fairy tales. (See Menstrual Calendar.) Talie- \nsin\'s Preiddeu Annwn (Harrowings of Hell) spoke of the Nine \nMaidens, priestesses of the perpetual fire that boiled the symbolic world \ncauldron; and of the yonic shrine, Hel\'s gate, to which the king\'s \nsword (or phallus) was lifted: \n\nIn Caer Pedryvan (four times revolving) \n\nThe Word from the cauldron it would be spoken \n\nBy the breath of nine maidens it would be kindled, \n\nThe head of Hades \'s cauldron what is it like? \n\nA rim it has, with pearls round its border; \n\nIt boils not a cowards food: it would not be perjured. \n\nThe sword ofLlwch Lleawc would be lifted to it. \n\nAnd in the hand ofLleminawc was it left. \n\nAnd before the door of Hell\'s gate lamps were burning, \n\nAnd when we accompanied Arthur, a brilliant effort, \n\nSeven alone did we return from Caer Veddwit. i0 \n\nNine sisters were the same as the nine Goddesses of the \nFortunate Isles ruled by Morgan le Fay, and the nine Muses of Greek \nmyth, and the pre-Hellenic ninefold Goddess Nonacris, queen of the \n\n\n\n152 \n\n\n\nStygian birth-gate. 51 She, or they, came from Oriental traditions almost \nas old as civilization. During their Bronze Age Shang period, the \nChinese represented the Great Goddess of birth by nine tripod caul- \ndrons like the mixing-vessels of the Muses. 32 \n\nThe primitive cult of the cauldron obviously discouraged "cow- \nards" because it was cult of martyrdom. Like Christian martyrs, the \ncauldron\'s victims were promised immediate resurrection into a life of \nglory. Strabo spoke of Cimbrian priestesses who sacrificed men, \nmaking them divine heroes, and caught their blood in magic cauldrons \nand read omens in their entrails. 33 \n\nSome myths hint at cannibal cauldrons large enough to boil a \nhuman body, and beliefs that death in the cauldron was not really \ndeath. A gypsy legend spoke of a hero forced by a mystic Lady to milk \ndangerous mares, then bathe in a boiling cauldron of their milk. A \ngod in the form of a royal horse promised to breathe frost on the \ncauldron and render it comfortably lukewarm. 34 The story recalls the \nCorinthians\' "man-eating mares," or horse-masked priestesses, who \ncaused Bellerophon to mount to heaven on the royal horse Pegasus, \nsymbol of apotheosis after death. 35 \n\nHorseback riding is a sign of deification on the famous silver \nsacrificial cauldron recovered from a Gundestrup peat bog. Manufac- \ntured about 100 B.C., the vessel showed a ceremony of sacrifice. Victims \nappear to be identified with the Horned God, Cernunnos, seated in a \nyogi\'s lotus position holding male and female symbols, the serpent and \ntore. 36 On foot, a row of victims approach the sacred cauldron which \nis shield-shaped and double-lobed, resembling a yoni. A priest or \npriestess is shown plunging one victim headfirst into the vessel. 37 \nAbove, the heroes depart glorified, on horseback, riding literally into the \nsunset, which represented heaven. Cernunnos himself was dismem- \nbered and cooked in a cauldron to rise again, which made him the \nobvious god for such rites. 38 \n\nA scene similar to that of the Gundestrup Cauldron occurs on a \nsacred cista from Palestrina-Praeneste. Rome\'s Mother of Time, \nAnna Perenna, appears to the dying god Mars in the guise of his virgin \nbride, Minerva. She stands over her naked lover and pushes his head \ndown into a boiling cauldron, while the dog of the underworld gate \nlooks on, as also on the Gundestrup example. 39 \n\nSome pagan Mysteries employed visions of the Cauldron as \nsymbolic death and rebirth. Before a Siberian shaman could practice, \nhe was required to undergo hallucinatory experiences of being chopped \nto pieces and boiled in a cauldron, sometimes for a period as long as \nthree years. Yakut, Buryat, and other tribes say the shaman must be \nkilled by the spirits of ancestors, cooked in their magic cauldron, then \ngiven new flesh. "Shaman" comes from Tungusic saman, "one who \ndied," a man assimilated to the Lord of Death called Samana in \nSanskrit. Tibetan shamans made the soul-journey to the "Great Hell" \npictured as an iron cauldron, called House of Iron or Iron Mountain. \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nStrabo Greek \ntraveler, geographer, \nand historian of the \nfirst century B.C., a \nfollower of the Stoic \nfaith. \n\n\n\nCimbri Germanic \ntribes from Jutland, \nwhich Romans called \nthe Cimbrian peninsula. \nIn the 2nd century \nB.C., a Cimbrian army \nmarched against \nRome and caused great \nconsternation in the \ncity. \n\n\n\n153 \n\n\n\nCave \n\n\n\nThere the aspirant was dismembered by rakshasas obsolete ancestral \ndeities and boiled, not in punishment for sin but as an initiatory \nprocedure. 40 \n\nSkald-shamans of Scandinavia made the same soul-journey to \nHvergelmir, the Mighty Roaring Cauldron, source of life-giving \nwaters at the foundations of the earth. This was another version of the \ntriple cauldron in the earth-womb, from which Odin received inspira- \ntion and power. Hvergelmir was triple too, accompanied by the fount of \nwisdom and memory called Mimir (an archaic "mother"), and the \nfount of ongoing life called Urdarbrunner, the stream of Mother Earth. \nFounts and cauldrons in the earth were tended by the three Fates \n(Norns), of whom the first was Mother Earth herself. 41 \n\nEven when the Cauldron of Regeneration entered Christian \ntradition as the Holy Grail, supposedly the chalice of Christ\'s last \nsupper, it was referred to as an escuele or "cauldron." 42 Arthur\'s knights \noriginally sought the Grail in the underworld of Annwn, receiving \ntheir divine vision of it in the castle of Elaine, or Elen, the virgin aspect \nof the triple Moon-goddess. It appeared in her hands, heralded by her \nyonic dove. It meant death for her chosen one, Galahad, who reigned as \na sacred king, then died at the altar as he saw his vision of the Grail. 43 \n\nThe Cistercian Estoire del Saint Graal said "two heathen rulers," \nMordrain and Nascien (Death and Rebirth) were blinded by the \nvision of the Grail, but healed by the touch of the lance that pierced \nChrist, both of these objects being kept in the same sanctuary. 44 The \nmotive seems to have been to belittle the female symbol (grail) in favor \nof the male symbol (lance). \n\n1.

Neoplatonist \nphilosopher, scholar, \nand writer; biographer \nof Plotinus; an \nopponent of the \nChristian church, \nwhich eventually \ndestroyed most of his \nbooks. \n\n\n\nCave \n\nPorphyry said before there were temples, all religious rites took place \nin caves. 1 The cave was universally identified with the womb of Mother \nEarth, the logical place for symbolic birth and regeneration. Etruscan \nand Roman temples featured a subterranean mundus, meaning both \n"earth" and "womb." 2 Similarly, the Sanskrit word for a sanctuary, \ngarbha-grha, meant "womb." 3 \n\nHoly places of Hinduism were caves representing the Great \n\n\n\n154 \n\n\n\nX \n\n\n\nMother\'s yoni. Many gompas (holy hermitages) were first established Cave \n\nin caves. Like the^mountain of paradise, home of the gods, the Four \n\nGreat Caves of Sikkim were distinguished according to the four ^^^^^___^_ \n\ncardinal points. North is the cave of the god\'s hill; west, the cave of great \n\nhappiness; south, the cave of occult fairies; east, the secret cave, from \n\nwhich the sun is born. 4 \n\nAmong the oldest forms of the Hindu Goddess was Kurukulla, a" \nmatrikadevi colored red like the womb, and called Mother of Cav- \nerns. 5 As an emanation of Kali she was worshipped in cave-temple \ncomplexes like Ellora, Ajanta, Elephanta. Her western counterpart \nwas Phrygian Cybele, "Cavern-dweller," the Great Mother of the \nGods. A Latin form of her name was Sybil, the prophetic spirit in the \ncavern-dwelling Cumaean sybils, by whose order the Great Mother of \nthe Gods was brought to Rome in 204 b.c. \n\nCybele\'s castrated priests claimed none of their brotherhood ever \ndied. Instead, they went "down into the cavern" to be united with \ntheir Goddess. Cybele\'s cavern-shrines were also called marriage cham- \nbers, like the pastos of Eleusis. The Alexandrian poet Nicander called \nthem "marriage bowers of Rhea Lobrine." 6 They were also the "sacred \nsubterranean places" where those who had emasculated themselves \nin honor of Attis and Cybele used to come to deposit the offering of \ntheir genitals. 7 \n\nRhea was the Cretan name of the same Goddess, during the long \nperiod when fatherhood was unknown or negligible in Cretan soci- \nety. 8 All life was supposed to have arisen from her uterine cave on \nMount Dicte, whence came the e-dicts of her holy law; hence her \ntitle of Dictynna, Lawgiver. She was also called Britomartis the "sweet \nvirgin," the mother without a spouse. 9 From the same uterine cave \nshe gave birth to Zeus, who later claimed to be Father of Gods. \n\nCave-temples of Rhea Dictynna evolved into dicteria, which the \nLaws of Solon designated public brothels. In the era of the promiscu- \nous priestesses, words for cave, temple, and brothel were often \ninterchangeable. 10 To visit the cave and lie with the holy harlot was \nan act of worship. During the early Christian era, most pagan mystery \ncults celebrated their most sacred rites in caves or underground \nchambers. \n\nFollowers of Mithra considered the cave so essential to proper \nworship that, if the site of a temple had no natural cave, an artificial \none was dug. The cave on the Vatican belonged to Mithra until 376 \na.d., when a city prefect suppressed the cult of the rival Savior and \nseized the shrine in the name of Christ, on the very birthday of the \npagan god, December 25. 11 \n\nDespite the church\'s efforts at suppression, the old deities contin- \nued to be worshipped in sacred caves for many centuries. So many \n"grottoes" contained pagan idols that decorative ideas for cathedral \nsculptures were copied from them: hence the grotesques or "grotto- \ncreatures" swarming in Gothic art. As late as the 1 5th century, Pope \n\n\n\n155 \n\n\n\nCave Calixtus II tried to forbid religious ceremonies in sacred caves. 12 As \n\nentrances to the underworld, caves were still associated with the Great \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ Mother\'s yonic gate. A long-revered gate to the womb of the world \nwas a sea-cave on the southern Peloponnese near the shrine of Mar- \nmari Mother Mari, the Sea-goddess whose other names were \nAphrodite Marina, Marah, and Mary. 13 \n\nUp to the 1 8th century, a cave called Tangrogo in Denbighshire \nwas kept by "three fairy sisters" the three Fates whose footprints \nwere often seen around the edge of its magic pool. The cave was said to \ncontain "hidden treasures," a term that often meant paraphernalia of \nthe Old Religion. 14 \n\nSpenser said the hidden treasures of the Faery Queen\'s Bower of \nBliss were the same as those of the virgin Mary\'s secret "enclosed \ngarden": a magic pool of regeneration, a Tree of Life, singing birds, \napples, and roses, including the central Rose of Love. Andreas \nCapellanus said the grotto of the pagan Goddess was a Palace of Love \nin the center of the earth (in medio mundi), with the male and \nfemale symbols of a Tree of Life and a sacred spring. 15 \n\nSacred caves were still used as "marriage bowers" long after \npaganism had been forced underground literally. Bards who adored \nthe heretical Goddess of Love (Minne) mentioned certain Grottoes of \nLove, hewn by heathen giants in the wild mountains, where people \ncould hide when "they wished privacy to make love." Gottfried von \nStrassburg said whenever such a cave was found, it was sealed with a \nbronze door inscribed La fossiure a le gent amant, the Grotto for People \nin Love. "Above, the vault was finely joined, and on the keystone \nthere was a crown, embellished beautifully by the goldsmith\'s art with \nan incrustation of gems. The pavement below was of a smooth, \nshining and rich marble, green as grass. In the center stood a bed, \nhandsome and cleanly hewn of crystal, high and wide, well raised \nfrom the ground, and engraved round about with letters which \naccording to the legend proclaimed its dedication to the goddess \nLove." 16 \n\nThe healing waters of all the sacred springs in Europe acquired \nnew myths ascribing their virtues to saints or to the Virgin, but their \nreal traditions sprang from the regenerative caves of the pagan Goddess. \nUp to the 19th century a sacred cave near Dunskey, Scotland, was \nused for the curative magic of its spring. The sick were brought from \ngreat distances to be bathed in the waters, always "at the change of \nthe moon," showing that the place was a matriarchal shrine. Its magic \nbaptisms were believed especially beneficial to weak or undernour- \nished children. 17 \n\n1. Robertson, 111. 2. Hays, 181. 3. Campbell, CM., 168. 4. Waddell, 256-57. \n\n5.

The custom was \ncontinued in Christian Europe. The church-yard, home of the dead, \nderived from Germanic gar d ox garth, meaning "earth" or "world," i.e., \nthe world of the dead under the soil. \n\nTantric dakinis celebrated the rites of the dead in cremation \ngrounds, "where ordinary people feared to go," because they were \ndeath-priestesses intimately acquainted with necropoli. 1 Their Goddess, \nKali Ma the Destroyer, was the same queen of tombs called Kalma in \nFinno-Ugric myth. 2 Dakinis became European vilas, valas, or wilis, \nwomen associated with the dead, later called witches.

As the earth-ruling aspect of \nthe Goddess\'s trinity, Ceres combined with Juno as queen of heaven, \nand Proserpine as queen of the underworld. She was called Ceres \nLegifera, "Ceres the Lawgiver." Her priestesses were considered the \nfoundresses of the Roman legal system. 1 \n\nCeres ruled Rome through her sacred matronae, during that lost \nperiod of four centuries before 200 B.C., a period whose written \nrecords were destroyed by later patriarchal historians, leaving only a \nresidue of myths and religious customs that were only vaguely \nexplained. 2 Farmers viewed her as the source of all food and kept her \nrites faithfully, for fear of crop failure. \n\nThis was true not only of Roman farmers but even of Christian \nfarmers. Ceres\'s greatest annual festival, the Cerealia, was celebrated \nin the British Isles almost to the present day. An account of the Shire of \nMurray in the late 19th century said, "In the middle of June, farmers \ngo round their corn with burning torches, in memory of the Cerealia." 3 \n\n1. Bachofen, 192. 2.

Harvest dances in the Spanish \nPyrenees were cerdana, "pig-dances," celebrated in honor of the \nGoddess who both gave and took away, and harvested souls in her \ncharacter as "the source of life, and the receptacle of the dead." 2 A \nrich wheat-growing region in the Pyrenees was dominated by her sacred \ntown, Puigcerda, or Cerdo\'s Hill. 3 Her cult probably went back to the \nprehistoric temples of Malta, which had images of the Goddess in the \nshape of a sow. \n\nWelsh bards who composed funerary elegies called themselves \ncerddorion, sons of Cerridwen or Cerdo. Their greatest hero, Talie- \nsin, a founder of their craft, was said to have been born of Cerridwen \nand specially treated by her to a few precious drops of magical \ninspiration from her Cauldron. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 168. 2.

In the runic calendar, the \nemblem of St. Chad was a palm branch, or Tree of Life. 1 \n\nA pagan deity named Chaddi is still worshipped by the Samoyeds, \nwho practice a nominal Christianity as long as all goes well, but in \ntime of trouble return to their own Chaddi. "Heathen services are \nconducted by night within old stone-circles, and all images of Chaddi \nare carefully screened from view. . . .

This ascent of the chakras was likened to \n\nChaos different stages of initiatory teaching, each taking place in a magic circle \n\n^ HH ^^^^ HBB ^ H whose members cooperated in the effort of comprehension. \n\nThe chakra was essentially the same as the Sufic halka, "magic \ncircle," called the heart and basic unit of Sufism. 1 The purpose of a \nproperly conducted chakra was to make each participant feel "as if the \nShakti was their own Mother who had borne them." 2 She was a \nmother-bride, compounded of the felt presence of both Goddess and \nwoman. In the classic chakra, each man had his wife or shakti to his \nleft, while the Lord of the Chakra with his shakti occupied the center of \nthe circle. 3 European pagan religions maintained the same arrange- \nment, which eventually became the pattern of the circular folk dance. \n\n1.

He was the \nsecond Constantine. He found it useful to be a Christian, since the \nchurch condoned his wars of acquisition as pagan tribal religions \nwould not and took its share of the spoils, eventually rewarding \nCharlemagne with the crown of the Empire. He was also allowed a \nspecial status of matrimony, not granted to other men. He had four \nwives and innumerable concubines, which the church tolerantly de- \nscribed as "marriages of the second rank." \' \n\nCharlemagne\'s reign was a painful history of aggression against the \nmatriarchal religions of his ancestors. In 772 he massacred more than \n4000 Saxons and destroyed their shrine at Heresburg, an omphalos of \nthe earth-mother Hera. He cut down the phallic tree trunk Irminsul, \n"Column of the World," the same axis mundi that Greeks called the \nGreat Herm, Norwegians called Yggdrasil, and Christians called the \ncross. 2 \n\nAfter destroying shrines to demoralize the pagan clans, Charle- \nmagne imposed vassalage on them and converted them to \nChristianity by the simple offer of a choice between Christ and \nimmediate death. All who rejected baptism were to be slain at once. \nIn 33 years of constant war, Charlemagne built the Holy Roman \nEmpire, at the cost of so many lives that historians have not even \ntried to estimate the extent of the slaughter. 3 \n\nCharlemagne\'s policy of conversion by the sword succeeded so \nwell that the church backed Christian rulers in this kind of military \nactivity ever since. As the Song of Roland put it: "The bishops bless the \nwaters and convert the heathen. If any man protests, he is burned or \nput to the sword." 4 \n\nSometimes the blessed waters themselves served to execute the \nunregenerate heathen. It was said that converts made under the rule \nof St. Goar were held under water until they either accepted Christ, or \ndrowned. 5 \n\n1. Murstein, 143. 2. Reinach, 144. 3. H. Smith, 251. \n4.

The British \nParliament passed an odd law in 1 770 that hinted at the same archetypal \nfears, making it illegal for a woman to "betray" any man into \nmatrimony with such artificialities as false hair, iron stays, high-heeled \nshoes, or perfume. If a husband demonstrated that his wife had used \nsuch devices, the marriage would be annulled, and the woman would \n"incur the penalty of the law now enforced against witchcraft." 2 \n\nWomen\'s singing was also highly suspect, as this was the classic \nmethod of casting spells. "Enchant" came from incantare, "to sing \nover" which also meant incantation. 3 \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 49. 2. Murstein, 227. 3.

The dead were buried with coins in the mouth or on the \neyelids to pay Charon\'s ferry. The Chinese also used to put money in \ngraves, for crossing the river of death. In the Balkans, it was said a \nwoman could make her husband "blind as a corpse" to her adultery, \nif she gave him water that had washed the coins from a corpse\'s eyes. 1 \nCharon\'s fee was Christianized as Peter\'s Penny: St. Peter\'s bribe for \nopening the heavenly gates. 2 In Greece, Charon found a new Christian \nidentity as St. Charus, escort and guardian of souls in the "lower \nworld," or common home of the dead. 3 \n\nl.Frazer,FO.T.,35. 2.

Lamusse, 283. \n\n\n\nCherry \n\nLike many slang expressions, the use of "cherry" for "virginity" may \nbe traced to a mythic past. Like other red fruits, such as the apple and \npomegranate, the cherry symbolized the Virgin Goddess: bearing her \nsacred blood color and bearing its seed within, like a womb. \n\nMaya, the virgin mother of Buddha, embraced the cherry tree Sala \nwhile giving birth to her divine child. 1 Some said the tree recognized \nher divinity and bent its branches down to offer its fruit. The story was \ncarried to Europe and spawned the medieval Cherry Tree Carol, in \nwhich Maya became Mary. \n\nGypsies applied the love-magic of the cherry to many magic \ncharms, especially those associated with virginity. When a gypsy girl \ndesired to attract a lover, she drilled holes through fourteen cherry \nstones on the fourteen nights of the waxing moon, and wore them on \n\n\n\n163 \n\n\n\nCherub a cord around her left thigh (the "female" side). 2 The obvious elements \n\nChimalman of this magic were penetration of the cherry, and building up to the \n\n^^ m mm m ^ m ^ m m mm full moon, indicating growth or pregnancy. \n\nFrench traditions of courtly love perhaps made "cherry" (cerise) \nsynonymous with "beloved" (cherie).

Brit, "Everest, Sir George." \n\n\n\nChristina, Saint \n\nAnother apocryphal "virgin martyr," whose legend was constructed \non no basis whatever, except the name, meaning "a female Christian." \nHer story was one of those sadistic wonder-tales in which Christian \nwriters delighted, piling torture upon torture in fantasies that quite lost \nsight of the natural limitations of human flesh. \n\nFor refusing to burn incense to the pagan gods, Christina was \nlocked up in a tower by her father. She was stripped and beaten with \nrods, then torn apart by hooks, and her limbs were broken. Nothing \ndaunted, she took up pieces of her own flesh and threw them in her \nfather\'s face, saying, "Take, tyrant, and eat the flesh thou hast begot- \nten!" So her father then had her sprinkled with oil and roasted on a \nfire-wheel. Then she was thrown into the sea with a stone around her \nneck. Angels saved her, and she returned to her father, who dropped \ndead of frustration. \n\nChristina\'s torments were continued by a judge named Elius, who \nhad her rocked in a red-hot iron cradle. Her next judge, Julian, threw \nher into a burning furnace, where she walked about unbumed for five \ndays. Then, poisonous snakes were hung about her neck. Then, her \nbreasts were cut off, and her tongue cut out. She took a piece of her \ntongue and threw it at Julian, striking him in the eye and blinding \nhim. Finally, Julian killed her by shooting three arrows into her. 1 This \ncan only have been a magic form of destruction, for Christina had by \nthis time amply demonstrated her invulnerability to every ordinary \nmethod of execution. \n\nIt de Voragine, 366-68. \n\n\n\n165 \n\n\n\nChristmas Christmas \n\nFor its first three centuries, the Christian church knew no birthday \nmttmmmmmmKmmm for its savior. During the 4th century there was much argument about \nadoption of a date. Some favored the popular date of the Koreion, \nwhen the divine Virgin gave birth to the new Aeon in Alexandria. 1 Now \ncalled Twelfth Night or Epiphany, this date is still the official nativity \nin Armenian churches, and celebrated with more pomp than Christmas \nby the Greek Orthodox. 2 \n\nRoman churchmen tended to favor the Mithraic winter-solstice \nfestival called Dies Natalis Solis Invictus, Birthday of the Uncon- \nquered Sun. 3 blended with the Greek sun-festival of the Helia by the \nemperor Aurelian, this December 25 nativity also honored such gods \nas Attis, Dionysus, Osiris, Syrian Baal, and other versions of the solar \nSon of Man who bore such titles as Light of the World, Sun of \nRighteousness, and Savior. 4 Most pagan Mysteries celebrated the birth \nof the Divine Child at the winter solstice. Norsemen celebrated the \nbirthday of their Lord, Frey, at the nadir oi the sun in the darkest days of \nwinter, known to them as Yule. The night of birth, Christmas Eve, \nwas called Modranect, Latin matrum noctem, the Night of the Moth- \ner originally a greater festival than Christmas Day. 5 \n\nEarly in the 4th century the Roman church adopted December 25 \nbecause the people were used to calling it a god\'s birthday. But \neastern churches refused to honor it until 375 a.d. 6 The fiction that \nsome record existed in the land of Jesus\'s alleged birth certainly could \nnot be upheld, for the church of Jerusalem continued to ignore the \nofficial date until the 7th century. 7 \n\nTrappings such as Yule logs, gifts, lights, mistletoe, holly, carols, \nfeasts, and processions were altogether pagan. They were drawn from \nworship of the Goddess as mother of the Divine Child. Christmas trees \nevolved from the pinea silva, pine groves attached to temples of the \nGreat Mother. On the night before a holy day, Roman priests called \ndendrophori or "tree-bearers" cut one of the sacred pines, decorated \nit, and carried it into the temple to receive the effigy of Attis. 8 Figures \nand fetishes attached to such trees in later centuries seem to have \nrepresented a whole pantheon of pagan deities on the World Tree. \n\nChristmas celebrations remained so obviously pagan over the years \nthat many churchmen bitterly denounced their "carnal pomp and \njollity." Polydor Virgil said: "Dancing, masques, mummeries, stage- \nplays, and other such Christmas disorders now in use with Christians, \nwere derived from these Roman Saturnalian and Bacchanalian festivals; \nwhich should cause all pious Christians eternally to abominate \nthem." 9 Puritans in 17th-century Massachusetts tried to ban Christmas \naltogether because of its overt heathenism. 10 Inevitably, the attempt \nfailed. \n\nA curious mistake in the Christmas mystery play of the Towneley \ncycle shows a Great Mother image not fully assimilated to that of \nMary. Before their attention was arrested by the annunciatory angel, \n\n\n\n166 \n\n\n\nidly chatting shepherds complained of their cruel overlords, and Christos \n\nprayed "Our Lady" to curse them. 11 Considering that they were not \n\nacquainted with the Mother of Christ, a rather different "Lady" must ^^^^_^_^^ \n\nhave been intended. \n\nAmong many other superstitions connected with Christmas were \nsome that were typical of pagan holy days, such as the belief that \nanimals could speak human words at midnight on Christmas Eve, or \nthat divinatory voices could be heard at crossroads at the same time. 12 \nAlso at midnight on Christmas Eve, water in wells and springs was \nsupposed to turn into blood, or its sacramental equivalent, wine. The \nmiracle was not to be verified, however; for all who witnessed it would \ndie within the year. 13 \n\n1. Campbell, M.I., 34. 2. Miles, 22. 3. Reinach, 282. \n\n4. H.

In the east, the god\'s lingam or the erect penis of his \nstatue was anointed with holy oil (Greek chrism) for easier penetration \nof his bride, the Goddess, impersonated by one of the temple virgins. 1 \nBefore anointing with oil, the god\'s phallus was often reddened to the \ncolor of life with pigment, wine, or blood specifically, the menstru- \nal blood of his bride. 2 Because kingship once depended on the sacred \nmarriage, anointing became the official rite of investiture for surro- \ngate kings as well as real kings. It carried a promise of godhood. \n\nThe words of the psalmist, "Thou anointest my head with oil," \nevolved from the ancient custom of anointing the god-king\'s penis, \nfor which "head" was a common euphemism. At royal weddings the \nking\'s head was crowned with a wreath of flowers, as in the Hindu \nsvayamara ceremony and flowers, in biblical language, symbolized \nmenstrual blood (Leviticus 15:24). Among the pagans, the temple \nvirgin deflowering herself on the god\'s carved phallus would place a \nwreath of flowers on his head at the same time. 3 Eventually the \nanointing of the phallus was displaced to the head because the marriage \nrite was omitted from public sacrifices of the Savior, Redeemer, Son \nof God, etc. Like the New Testament Christ, he was "anointed" only \nfor his burying: the marriage with the earth (John 12:7). Jesus \nbecame a Christos when he was christ-ened for burial by Mary, the \nmagdalene or temple maiden (Matthew 26:12), who also announced \nhis resurrection (Mark 1 5:47). \n\nAmong the Essenes, a Christos was a priest, specifically designated \nSin Bearer or Redeemer: one who atoned for others\' sins. 4 Among \nthe Slavs, Christos or Krstnik meant a sacrificial hero and also an \n\n\n\n167 \n\n\n\nChthonia "accursed one," due to the ancient practice of laying a formal curse \n\nCirce on the Sin Bearer before he was sacrified. 5 See Firstborn; Kingship. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ 1 .

Ella was Hel, or \nHelle, daughter of Mother Earth, the Goddess with her regenerative \nfires reduced to cinders. Her ugly stepmother was the new church. Her \nugly stepsisters were the church\'s darlings, the military aristocracy and \nthe clergy. \n\nAn early German version of the story said Cinderella\'s real mother \nthe Earth, though dead, sent from her grave a fairy tree in answer to \nher daughter\'s prayer. This tree produced golden apples, fine clothes, \nand other gifts. Thus the "fairy godmother" of later versions seems to \nhave been a ghost of the mother, the dispossessed Great Goddess in \nretirement underground. 1 \n\nBeautified with her new riches, Cinderella won the "prince" \n(mankind), ever easily impressed by the display of finery. Their union \nwas symbolized by fitting her foot into a shoe, a common sexual \nallegory. The Eleusinian Mysteries signified sacred marriage by \nworking a phallic object in a woman\'s shoe. 2 The glass slipper perhaps \nstood for the Crystal Cave by which pagan heroes entered the uterine \nunderworld. \n\nLike other secret medieval prophecies of the overthrow of the rich, \npowerful theocracy, the downfall of Cinderella\'s ugly stepmother and \nstepsisters may have been intended as a prophecy. 3 \n\n1.

She ruled \nall the stars that determined men\'s fates. Pliny said Circe was a \nGoddess who "commanded all the lights of heaven." 3 \n\n1. Lindsay, O.A., 239. 2. Graves, G.M. 2, 358. 3.

Hitching, 212. \n\n\n\nCleopatra VII \n\nOne of the last Goddess-queens of Egypt, Cleopatra followed the \nprecedent of Egyptian rulers in general and turned herself into a \ndivinity. At an Alexandrian festival she "assumed the robe of Isis and \nwas addressed as the New Isis." \' \n\nThough she was not a native Egyptian, but one of the Macedo- \nnian family of Ptolemies, Cleopatra exercised the ancient \nprerogatives of Egyptian queens. Julius Caesar became her lover be- \ncause it was the only way he could annex Egypt to the Roman \nprovinces. By time-honored law, no man could exercise political power \nin Egypt unless he loved its queen. \n\nSome of Cleopatra\'s less eminent lovers lasted only one night and \npaid with their lives for a single taste of her love. 2 The custom seems \nto have been adopted by later male rulers of Arabia, to judge by the \ngynocidal sultan of the Arabian Nights. The thinking behind this \ncustom remains mysterious. It may be that men who lay with the queen \n(and therefore with the Goddess herself) were believed to gain \nimmortality thereby, for any man who coupled with a Goddess would \nbecome a God. Sacred marriage, followed by death and deification, \nformed the basic pattern of many ancient Mysteries. \n\n\n\n169 \n\n\n\nClitoris \n\n\n\nWhen her son Caesarion was born, Cleopatra built herself a \nmammisi or "birth temple" for the worship of her own maternity. In \nthe shrine she was pictured in the act of giving birth, assisted by the \nSeven Hathors. 3 Cleopatra\'s mammisi stood until the 19th century \na.d., when it was described by travelers, but it disappeared in the past \ncentury. 4 \n\nShe also gave birth to the sun and moon, in the form of twins \nnamed Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene Alexander-Sun and \nCleopatra-Moon. 5 Perhaps these children represented her own mating \nwith the solar god of Alexandria. \n\n1.

Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the \nancient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nClitoris \n\nFrom Greek kleitoris, "divine, famous, goddess-like." l Greek myth \npersonified the phallus as Priapus and the clitoris as an Amazon queen \nnamed Kleite, ancestral mother of the Kleitae, a tribe of warrior \nwomen who founded a city in Italy. 2 In Corinth, Kleite was a princess \n"whom Artemis made grow tall and strong," an allegory of her \nerection. 3 Or, again, she was a nymph who loved the phallus of the sun \ngod and always followed his motion with her "head" a transparently \nsexual metaphor. 4 In a bowdlerized version of the story she was \ntransformed into a sunflower, turning to follow the motion of the sun \nacross the sky. \n\nPausanias said the Arcadian city of Clitor was sacred to Artemis, or \nto Demeter, and stood at the genital shrine of the earth, the \nheadwaters of the Styx (or Alph). 5 The meaning of this geographical \nmyth is made clear by the primitive belief that the Styx represented \nMother Earth\'s menstrual blood, source and solvent of all things. In \nthis place, too, the orgiastic priestesses of Artemis were "soothed" out \nof their frenzies; therefore the local omphalos must have signified the \nGoddess\'s clitoris instead of her navel. \n\nLater patriarchal society managed to ignore the clitoris. Since the \nChristian church taught that women should not experience sexual \npleasure but should only endure intercourse for the sake of procreation, \ngrowing girls and boys alike were kept ignorant of female sexuality, \ninsofar as possible. 6 Even physicians came to believe that no clitoris \nwould be found on a virtuous woman. \n\nFrom medieval times onward, virtuous women rarely showed \nthemselves naked to any man, even a husband; so it was perhaps not \nsurprising that men should remain ignorant of the female anatomy they \nclumsily fumbled with in the dark. Pious married couples wore the \nchemise cagoule, a voluminous nightgown with a small hole in front, to \nallow impregnation with a minimum of body contact. 7 \n\n\n\n170 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a witch trial in 1 593, the investigating gaoler (a married man) Clitoris \n\napparently discovered a clitoris for the first time, and identified it as a \n\ndevil\'s teat, sure proof of the witch\'s guilt. It was "a little lump of flesh, ^^^^^^^^^ \nin manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an \ninch," which the gaoler, "perceiving at the first sight thereof, meant not \nto disclose, because it was adjoining to so secret a place which was not \ndecent to be seen; yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a \nmatter," he showed it to various bystanders. 8 The bystanders had \nnever seen anything like it either. The witch was convicted. \n\nEuropean society certainly knew all about the penis, and never \nceased to worship it, evert in Christian times (see Phallus Worship). \nYet the clitoris was forgotten: \n\nAlmost from the very beginning of our lives, we are all taught that the \nprimary male sex organ is the penis, and the primary female sex organ \nis the vagina. These organs are supposed to define the sexes, to be the \ndifference between boys and girls .... This is a lie ... . Woman \'s \nsexual pleasure is often left out of these definitions. If people considered \nthat the purpose of the female sex organs is to bring pleasure to \nwomen, then female sex would be defined by, and focused on, a different \norgan. Everyone would be taught from infancy that, as the primary \nmale sex organ is the penis, so the primary female sex organ is the clitoris. 9 \n\nMedical authorities in the 19th century seemed anxious to \nprevent women from discovering their own sexuality. Girls who learned \nto develop orgasmic capacity by masturbation, just as boys learned it, \nwere regarded as medical problems. Often they were "treated" or \n"corrected" by amputation or cautery of the clitoris, or "miniature \nchastity belts, sewing the vaginal lips together to put the clitoris out of \nreach, and even castration by surgical removal of the ovaries. But \nthere are no references in the medical literature to surgical removal of \ntesticles or amputation of the penis to stop masturbation (in boys)." 10 \n\nIn the United States, the last recorded clitoridectomy for curing \nmasturbation was performed in 1948 on a five-year-old girl. 11 \n\nThe Catholic church\'s definition of masturbation as "a grave \nmoral disorder" in 1976 may have incorporated fears of the effect of \nmasturbation on female orgasmic capacity, now well known to evolve \nthrough masturbatory experience the same as that of a male. 12 Less \nthan a century ago, in the Victorian era, priests and doctors realized that \n"the total repression of woman\'s sexuality was crucial to ensure her \nsubjugation." Leading authorities like Dr. Isaac Brown Baker per- \nformed many clitoridectomies to cure women\'s nervousness, hysteria, \ncatalepsy, insanity, female dementia, and other catchwords for symp- \ntoms of sexual frustration. 13 \n\nI.

Actually, \nConstantine didn\'t do this in his own lifetime; his bishops did it \nafterward. Constantine was not so much a worshipper of Christ as he \nwas a worshipper of himself. \n\nConstantine considered himself the incarnation of "the supreme \ngod," a combination of Apollo, Mithra, Jupiter, the sun, and Christ. \nHe called himself "the instrument of the Deity." He said, "I banished \nand utterly abolished every form of evil then prevailing, in the hope \nthat the human race, enlightened through me, might be called to a \nproper observance of God\'s holy laws." He designated for his tomb a \nspot in the center of the cruciform Church of the Holy Apostles, saying \nhe would lie forever with six apostles at his left hand and six at his \nright. A contemporary historian said Constantine was "more greedy for \npraise than it is possible to tell." \' \n\nHe supported freedom of worship in his empire for the wrong \nreason: so that no god would be offended enough to take revenge on \nhim personally. He issued edicts of toleration for all religions, so that \n"we should give to Christians and to everyone else the right freely to \nfollow whatever religion they chose, so that, whatever divinity is \nenthroned in heaven may be well-disposed and propitious towards \nme." He tried to restrain Christian fanatics from persecuting pagans, \nJews, and heretics, writing in an encyclical letter to Bishop Eusebius \nof Nicomedia that these others must be "assured of the same degree of \npeace and tranquility" as orthodox Christians. 2 The orthodox Chris- \ntians did not agree, and soon after Constantine\'s death they instituted \nextensive persecutions and crusades extending over the next three \ncenturies. \n\n\n\n173 \n\n\n\nConstantine I Constantine did his best for the church. In one year he obtained \n\ntwelve thousand converts by the simple offer of a new garment and \n^ mm ^^^^^^m twenty gold pieces to each person who embraced the faith. 3 But he did \nas much for other cults too. He didn\'t become a Christian himself \nuntil the final weeks of his life, when he accepted baptism on his \ndeathbed, as insurance for his after-life. \n\nConstantine\'s life was hardly a model of piety. He murdered his \neldest son, his second wife, his father-in-law, his brother-in-law, and \n"many others," a chronicler said. His first wife, Minervina evidently a \npriestess of the Moon-goddess Minerva mysteriously disappeared. \nNo one knows what became of her. His second wife Fausta was his \nstepping-stone to the throne, according to the ancient rule of the \nhieros gamos. Eulogists at the wedding said, "The title of sovereignty \nhas now accrued to thee, O Constantine, through thy father-in- \nlaw." 4 There being no law of primogeniture, the throne still passed \nthrough the female line. \n\nTo eliminate a potential rival, Constantine killed his eldest son \nCrispus, born of the vanished Minervina. Afterward he accused \nFausta of having had a love affair with her now-deceased stepson, along \nwith other adulterous affairs, and killed her; it seems that any lover \nthe empress took was still a threat to the emperor\'s political position. 5 \n\nThe murdered Crispus might have played the role of savior and \nsacred king, for after his death he was virtually canonized as a \n"blessed martyr." Churches in Greece were dedicated to him for over a \nmillenium. "During the period of the Turkish occupation of Greece, \nover a thousand years later, he was still remembered as the Caesar, the \nhero-prince, the Christian Theseus, as it were, founder of the \nmodern Greek nation." 6 Yet Crispus was neither a Caesar nor a \nChristian. \n\nChristian bishops eventually convinced Constantine that their God \nwould forgive his crimes and enthrone him in heaven. When he felt \ndeath approaching, he said to them: "The salvation which I have \nearnestly desired of God these many years I do now expect. It is time \ntherefore that we should be sealed and signed in the badge of immortal- \nity." 7 So he was baptized, and died in the confident expectation of a \nglorious resurrection. \n\nHis literary whitewashing began at once. Despite his two wives and \nnumerous concubines, Christian panegyrists said he was "wedded to \nchastity." 8 Eusebius elevated all the emperor\'s doings into acts of piety, \nand invented the legend that Christ had converted him with a holy \nvision at the Milvian bridge. Later Christian legend claimed Constan- \ntine saw the sign of the cross in the sky, with the words in hoc signo \nvinces (in this sign conquer). However, the holy sign that Constantine \nplaced on his battle flags was not the cross. It was the labarum, a \nmonogram of Mithra and a sign of the sun, already in use by several \npagan emperors before Constantine. 9 \n\nAs an example of Constantine\'s Christian mercy, Cedrenus re- \n\n\n\n174 \n\n\n\ncorded that once when he was ill, he collected a number of children Convent \n\nto kill them and bathe in their blood as a healing charm. However, \n\nmoved by their mothers\' tears, the emperor spared the children\'s lives ^^^^^__^^_ \n\nafter all, and "the saints" restored his health as a reward for this act of \n\nmercy. 10 No one seemed inclined to criticize him for contemplating \n\nthe massacre in the first place. \n\nConstantine\'s luminous example showed that Christian magic \ncould prevent port-mortem punishment for a ruthless life. "Future \ntyrants were encouraged to believe," says Gibbon, "that the innocent \nblood which they might shed in a long reign would instantly be \nwashed away in the waters of regeneration; and the abuse of religion \ndangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue." n \n\nChristianity served all the emperors after him, with the sole \nexception of Julian "the Apostate," much vilified by the church for \nsuspending the persecutions of pagans and trying to restore the culture \nof classical Rome. But Julian died young; some said he was assassinat- \ned by a Christian. 12 The war against paganism proceeded. Beginning \nabout 330 a.d., pagan shrines were looted and stripped of their gold, \nsilver, and bronze treasures, many of which were carried off to decorate \nConstantine\'s greatest monument to himself, the city of Constantino- \nple. 1? As Eusebius gleefully described the process: "The lurking-places \nof the heretics were broken up . . . and the savage beasts which they \nharbored were put to flight." H \n\nConstantine\'s edicts of toleration were rescinded after his death. \nThe new imperial religion attacked its rivals in a show of intolerance \non a grander scale than had ever been seen before. It was a great \nsuccess. "Forty years after the death of Constantine, the church had \nalready acquired a tenth of the whole of the landed property in Rome\'s \nwestern empire, a figure that in western Europe rose to a third during \nthe middle ages. . . . The church since the time of Constantine affords \nproof that it is not spiritual truth that has triumphed with the spread of \nChristianity but human power." 15 \n\nI. J.H.

A 10th-century Saxon chronicle speaks of double \n\n\n\n175 \n\n\n\nConvent convents inhabited by "priests of both sexes," although in a transla- \n\ntion it was revised to read, "priests of both orders." 2 \nm ^^^^^^^^^^ m As Christian laws encroached on women\'s property rights, many \n\nwomen of noble rank took vows to remain single, so as to protect \ntheir wealth from the claims of husbands. Thus originated the so-called \nconvent of noble ladies, an independent mini-queendom. For exam- \nple, the Saxon convent of Gandersheim in the 9th century held \noverlordship directly from the king. The abbess conducted her own \ncourts of law, kept her own seat in the imperial parliament, and \nmaintained her own standing army. 3 Culture and learning were \npursued. This convent trained the poetess Hrotswitha of Gandersheim, \ncalled "a Sappho, deserving to rank with the fabled Veleda and \nAurinia, ancient German poet-priestesses." 4 \n\nIn the 7th century, a papal bull confirmed the rights of freedom \nfrom taxation and from episcopal jurisdiction of the Parthenon of \nBeatae Mariae et Sanctae Columbae et Agathae (Virgin-house of \nBlessed Marys and Holy Doves and Kindly Ones). Abbesses of Las \nHuelgas ruled sixty towns, had the right to license bishops and priests \nwithin their dioceses, to confer benefices on clergy of their own \nchoice, to nominate ecclesiastical judges, to hear criminal cases among \ntheir subjects, and to establish new parishes. Bishops and apostolic \ndelegates were forbidden to visit churches, parishes, clergy, or beneficia- \nries in the abbess\'s territory. The nuns remained exempt from \nepiscopal jurisdiction all the way up to 1874. 5 \n\nAncient goddess-queens were described as "abbesses" in Christian \nhistories, to disguise the real nature of the pagan matriarchate that \nbacked them. Such a one was St. Odilia or Ottilia, called the abbess of \nOdilienberg (Hohenburg), a pilgrimage shrine of Alsace that was her \nown Holy Mountain. 6 Her legend had no documentary basis. 7 She was \nfraudulently canonized, only to attract her votaries to Christianity. \n\nMany abbesses retained their pagan title of High Priestess \nSacerdos Maxima especially in the German convents. At Quedlin- \nburg the abbess was "in control of the whole town, its people, churches, \nhospitals, clergy, canons and canonesses, and all religious orders." \nShe was not only High Priestess, but also Superior Canoness of the \nCathedral, Metropolitana (mayor), and Matricia (matriarch). At St. \nMary\'s Uberwasser in Munster, the abbess\'s title was Prima domna et \nmatre nostra spirituale, "Mistress-Leader and Our Spiritual Mother." \nCistercian monks at Las Huelgas swore obedience to the abbess as "the \nIllustrious Lady ... my Prelate, and my Lady, Superior, Mother and \nlegitimate administrator in spiritual and temporal affairs of the Royal \nMonastery and its Hospital." 8 \n\nSome centuries earlier, the Latin title of Sacerdos Maxima meant a \nhigh priestess of the Great Mother of the Gods. She was assisted by \nlesser priestesses known as ministra, "ministers." The word "sodality" \ncame from Latin sodales, a college of dancing priestesses trained in \nthe Great Mother\'s temple. 9 \n\n\n\n176 \n\n\n\nThat women in convents long retained the sexual freedom of the Convent \n\nancient priestesses is shown by interchangeable use of the words \n\n"convent" and "brothel" in medieval times. Nicholas Clemangis said ^^^^^^-^^ \n\nthe monasteries were not so much sanctuaries of God as they were \n"abodes of Venus." 10 \n\nThe word nun originally meant a nurse, that is, a priestess of a \nhealing shrine, like the "nymphs" in colleges of Hygeia and Panacea \nin pagan Greece. That the convents continued to function as hospitals \nis suggested by medieval romances: wounded, sick, or dying folk were \nusually cared for by "nuns." n The word also meant a virgin mother in \nGermanic paganism. A cognate was Nana, virgin mother of the god \nBalder. \n\nSometimes, pagan queens established convents in order to have \nthemselves canonized, just as Roman emperors were made gods by \nvirtue of their religious leadership. The canon of saints includes several \npagan queens whose only claim to beatitude was wealth, which \nbought the jurisdiction of an abbey and its subject lands. Some of the \nqueen-saints were even distinctly hostile to churchmen, like Queen \nBathild, foundress of a druidic convent at Chelles in the 7th century. \nShe was the real ruler of the western Franks, having placed her son \nChlotar on the throne. Certain bishops who tried to interfere with her \nwere assassinated. In the end she was "unceremoniously" removed \nfrom power by Christian nobles, and apparently murdered as a heretic, \nthough her subjects maintained her cult and called her Saint \nBathild. 12 \n\nIn Bede\'s time, Queen Ethelreda was ordained High Priestess of \nEly, and was succeeded by other supreme abbesses governing the \nmonastery\'s beatarum regimine feminarum (holy order of women) up \nto the Danish invasion in 866. The abbey of Wherwell was founded \nby Queen Elfrida in 986; it was exempt from earthly services, and held \nmany territories and churches. 13 \n\nAnother pagan princess who founded a convent in the 7th century \nand was canonized, was St. Wereburg of the royal house of Mercia, \nruler of the city of Chester. Her establishment was specifically for \n"noble women" refusing to give up their property to husbands. St. \nWereburg was canonized centuries later, on the strength of a legend \nthat her holy bones had extinguished the fires set in the city of \nChester by marauding Danes. 14 \n\nSt. Hild, or Hilda, of the royal house of Northumberland, estab- \nlished one of the most famous double monasteries of Anglo-Saxon \ntimes at Hartlepool, the "Isle of Stags." Her influence extended over all \nEngland. She created bishops and abbots, favoring especially the \npoet-missionaries of Celtic background. Bede said "all who knew her \ncalled her Mother." 15 Since she bore the name of the pagan Great \nMother Hild, or Hel, one might wonder about the real basis of her \nauthority, in a century when a majority of people had not yet heard of \nChristianity. 16 \n\n\n\n177 \n\n\n\nConvent Even when convents became Christianized, abbesses were still \n\nordained like bishops, and in some areas held more secular power than \n\n^^^^ Bi ^^^^ M bishops, though church histories have tried to conceal this, sometimes \nthrough deliberate falsification of the records. For instance, a papal bull \nsaid the abbess of the Cassian foundation in Marseilles was "or- \ndained"; a later editor changed the word to "blessed." At Jouarre, \nQuedlinburg, Conversano, and other places, an abbess held supreme \njurisdiction over both clergy and laity in her territory. According to the \nRule of St. Donatus, abbesses functioning as Matris Spirituale (Spiri- \ntual Mother) regularly heard confessions. French ecclesiastical records \nsay abbesses gave absolution by imposition of their hands on the \nheads of men. 17 \n\nThe church began to encroach on the rights of convents in the \n12th and 13th centuries, devising ways to appropriate the nuns\' \nproperty and make them subject to male clergy. At Fontevrault, \ncanonesses preceded the monks in processions, carried the pastoral \ncross, preached, read the Gospel, and heard confessions. Pope Innocent \nIII deprived them of these privileges. Disagreements arose between \nmale and female clergy. Monks insisted they would no longer genuflect \nevery time they passed the abbess. Nuns reacted by refusing to kneel \nin the confessional before their brothers. Innocent III also commanded \nthe abbess of Jouarre, her clergy, and her layfolk to subject them- \nselves to the authority of the bishop of Meaux. When the abbess asked \nfor time to prove her right to independence, she and all her \ncommunity were excommunicated. Decrees of the Council of Trent \nchanged church laws to say women\'s orders must be taken over and \nsupervised by men\'s orders. 18 \n\nConsiderable bitterness accompanied sexual segregation of the \ndouble convents, judging from the letter of Abbot Conrad of March- \ntal, on barring women from his order: \n\nWe and our whole community of canons, recognizing that the wickedness \nof women is greater than all other wickedness of the world, and there is \nno anger like that of women, and that the poison of asps and dragons is \nmore curable and less dangerous for men than the familiarity of \nwomen, have unanimously decreed for the safety of our souls, no less than \nfor that of our bodies and goods, that we will on no account receive any \nmore sisters to the increase of our perdition, but will avoid them like \npoisonous animals. ,9 \n\nConvents had been centers of higher learning for women in an \nage when women were forbidden access to schools and universities. \nEarlier in the medieval period, girls as well as boys attended ecclesias- \ntical schools in Ireland and learned to read and write; but this practice \nwas later forbidden, the schools being kept only for males. 20 Premon- \nstratensian and Cistercian orders were famed as educators of women, \nuntil the Council of Trent ruled that women\'s orders must be taken \nover by men\'s orders. 21 Then Cistercian nuns were forbidden to \nestablish any more teaching convents. 22 \n\nNuns were further commanded not to teach or discuss theological \n\n178 \n\n\n\nmatters. This was used as a device for outlawing their orders and Convent \n\nconfiscating their property. It served as an excuse for the Council of \n\nVienne to deprive the teaching nuns called Beguines of their lands \n\nand houses, in 1 3 1 2 when monks of the Inquisition demanded them: \n\nWe have been told that certain women commonly called Beguines, \nafflicted by a kind of madness, discuss the Holy Trinity and the divine \nessence, and express opinions on matters of faith and sacraments. \nSince these women promise no obedience to anyone and do not \nrenounce their property or profess an approved Rule . . . fw]e have there- \nfore decided and declared with the approval of the Council that their \nway of life is to be permanently forbidden and altogether excluded from \nthe Church of God. 2 * \n\nThe Beguines were forced to integrate into orders approved by \nthe pope, where they would receive no education. Their properties \nwere taken over by the Inquisition to provide dwellings and prisons \nfor the inquisitors\' use. 24 \n\nFrom the 1 2th century on, there was increasing pressure on \nconvents to adopt rules of close confinement, to keep nuns segregat- \ned from the outside world. The canonesses of St. Mary\'s Uberwasser \nrebelled three times against the imposition of the Benedictine Rule, \nwhich would force them into seclusion. 25 Many convents were threat- \nened with excommunication, dissolution, or even prosecution by the \nInquisition to force them to accept strict seclusion and to cease develop- \ning the sisters\' minds. \n\nEarly in the 17th century, teacher Mary Ward tried to found a \nCatholic order of teaching nuns known as the English Ladies, to \nprovide education for girls. She and her sisters refused to submit to the \ncloister, so Mary was arrested and accused of heresy. Her order was \nsuppressed in 1629. Pope Urban VIII rebuked them: "Certain women, \ntaking the name of Jesuitesses, assembled and living together, built \ncolleges, and appointed superiors and a General, assumed a peculiar \nhabit without the approbation of the Holy See . . . carried out works \nby no means suiting the weakness of their sex, womanly modesty, \nvirginal purity." 26 With typically patriarchal reasoning, the English \nLadies were punished for doing what women were supposed to be \nunable to do. \n\nA few convents managed to hold on to their pre-patriarchal \nindependence. The clergy failed to turn out the canonesses of St. \nWaudru, at Mons. Monks of Fontevrault likewise failed to take over the \nmain church or the nuns\' house, and were obliged to continue to vow \nobedience to the abbesses, up to the French Revolution. 27 \n\n1. Encyc.

Ravensdale & Morgan, 153. \n\n\n\nCow \n\nPerhaps the most common manifestation of the Great Mother as \nPreserver was the white, horned, milk-giving Moon-cow, still sacred in \nIndia as a symbol of Kali. Egypt revered Mother Hathor as the \nheavenly cow whose udder produced the Milky Way, whose body was \n\n\n\n180 \n\n\n\nthe firmament, and who daily gave birth to the sun, Horus-Ra, her \nGolden Calf, the same deity worshipped by Aaron and the Israelites: \n"These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land \nof Egypt" (Exodus 32:4). \n\nThe name of Italy meant "calf-land." ! This country too was the \ngift of the Milk-giver, whom Etruscans called Lat, Arabs called Al- \nLat, Greeks called Latona, Lada, Leto, or Leda. She ruled Latium, and \ngave her milk (Jatte) to the world. \n\nAll Europe was named after the Goddess as a white Moon-cow, \nwhom the Greeks mated to the white bull incarnation of Zeus. Her \nalternative name was Io, "Moon." Under this name she was presented \nin classic mythology as a rival of Hera, but patriarchal writers were \nalways setting different manifestations of the same Goddess at odds with \none another, possibly on the principle of divide and conquer. Hera \nherself was named Io, ancestress of the Ionians. In her temple on the \nsite of Byzantium she appeared as the same lunar cow, the Horned \nOne, wearing the same crescent headdress as the Egyptian Cow- \ngoddess. 2 \n\nThe Cow as creatress was equally prominent in myths of northern \nEurope, where she was named Audumla; she was also Freya, or a \nValkyrie taking the form of a "fierce cow." 6 A semi-patriarchal Norse \nmyth tried to attribute the creation of the world to the giant Ymir, \nwhose body and blood made the universe. But he was not the first of \ncreatures. The Cow preceded him, for he lived on her milk. 7 \n\nEarlier myths showed the universe being "curdled" into shape \nfrom the Cow\'s milk. In India, many still believe literally the creation \nmyth known as Churning of the Sea of Milk. 8 The Japanese version \nsaid the primordial deep went "curdlecurdle" (koworokoworo) when \nstirred by the first deities, to make clumps of land. 9 The ancient Near \nEast thought human bodies too were curdled from the Goddess\'s \nmilk. One of her liturgies was copied into the Bible: "Has thou not \npoured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?" (Job 10:10). \n\nThe root of "cow" was Sanskrit Gau, Egyptian kau or kau-t. \nGoddess-names like Gauri and Kauri also designated the yonic \ncowrie shell. 10 Brahman rebirth ceremonies used either a huge golden \nyoni or an image of the Cow-mother. "When a man has for grave \ncause been expelled from his caste, he may be restored to it after passing \nseveral times under the belly of a cow." u The Egyptian Goddess as \nbirth-giver typically wore a cow\'s head or horns, as she offered her \nbreasts with both hands. 12 As the nursing mother who gave each \nEgyptian his secret soul-name (re/7), she was entitled Renenet, the Lady \nof the Double Granary, a reference to her inexhaustible breasts. 13 \nThe bovine enzyme rennet, used even in antiquity to curdle milk, was \nalso sacred to her. \n\nA favorite Roman emblem of the Goddess was the Cornucopia, \nHorn of Plenty: a cow\'s horn pouring forth all the fruits of the earth. \nThe cow was honored as the wetnurse of humanity, and her image is \n\n\n\nCow \n\n\n\nHerodotus said the \nmilk-giving Mother \nHera-Io-Latona was \nthe same as Egypt\'s \nButo, "an archaic \nqueen of the Lower \nKingdom." 5 The \nholy city of Buto, \nEgypt\'s oldest \noracular shrine, was \nknown to the Greeks \nas Latopolis, "city of \nLat." 4 Of course \nButo, or Lat, was only \nanother name for \nHathor, or Isis, or Mut, \nor Neith; all \nrepresented "the great \ncow which gave birth \nto Ra, the great \ngoddess, the mother \nof all the gods ... the \nCow, the great lady, \nlady of the south, the \ngreat one who gave \nbirth to the sun, who \nmade the germ of \ngods and men, the \nmother of Ra, who \nraised up Tern in \nprimeval time, who \nexisted when nothing \nelse had being, and \nwho created that which \nexists." 5 \n\n\n\n181 \n\n\n\nCowrie still inadvertently invoked to this day as an expletive Holy Cow, or a \n\npejorative Sacred Cow. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ 1.

Skeletons from the \nSolutrean period, ca. 20,000 B.C., have been found "lavishly decorated \nwith cowrie shells." l \n\nEgyptians decorated sarcophagi with cowrie shells as a rebirth \ncharm. Cowries are still prized throughout the east for their supposed \nhealing and regenerative powers. Cowrie necklaces are valued in India \nas amulets against the evil eye. 2 Moslem women believe cowries \nshould be worn on the body during pregnancy. The Japanese keep \ncowries in wardrobe cabinets "for luck"; if no cowries are available, \npornographic pictures of female genitals serve as a substitute. 5 Gypsies \nvalued a cowrie above all other kinds of protective amulets. 4 Chris- \ntianized natives of the Sudan consider a strip of leather stamped with the \nsign of the cross a valuable amulet; but it is not "strong magic" unless \nnine cowrie shells are attached to it. 5 \n\nRomans called the cowrie shell matriculus, "little matrix," symbol \nof an Alma Mater (soul-mother) or teaching priestess, which is why a \nstudent still "matriculates" into instruction. The Roman Alma Mater \ntaught the philosophy of love as well as the love of philosophy. Unlike \nChristians, the pagans believed the capacity for heterosexual love \nrequired careful nurture and training. \n\nSometimes the Romans called a cowrie porcelk, "little sow," \nbecause it stood for the Goddess who was the Great Sow, like \nDemeter, Astarte, Ceres, Freya, Cerridwen, etc. From porcelk came \n"porcelain," so called because of its resemblance to the white glazed \nsurface of the shell. 6 A Greek word for the cowrie was kteis, which also \nmeant a scallop, a comb, and a vulva. 7 \n\nThe extreme antiquity of cowrie symbolism in the Middle East is \nshown by the ancestor-skulls preserved by the people of Jericho in the \n7th millenium b.c. These forerunners of the Jewish teraphim were \nsevered from the body, provided with features of painted plaster, and \nmade to "see" with the eyes of cowrie shells. 8 \n\nSpeaking of the Melanesians\' and Polynesians\' reverence for \ncowries, a missionary, Rev. George Brown, wrote, "There is some \nsacredness about them, but what it is, is not at all clear. The natives will \nnot talk about them at all." 9 It seems likely that the natives he \n\n\n\n182 \n\n\n\nnentioned had already become well aware that there was no use talking Crab \n\nabout sexual symbols to missionaries.

Romans made the connection with birth quite \nclear: Juno Lucina was not only a creatress, but also the Mother who \nbrought "light" to the eyes of the newborn. 3 The biblical God who said \n"Let there be light" (Fiat lux) copied the word of the Goddess. \n\nThe prominence given everywhere to that moment of light sug- \ngests archetypal memories of the first impact of light on newborn eyes \nwhich have never seen light before. Like dreams of the individual \nunconscious, myths of the collective unconscious reveal hidden \nmemories of the birth trauma. "Locked up in the depths of our \nunconscious mind is the terrific impact of birth, the violent adventure \nthat uprooted our pre-natal world." 4 It is also locked up in the symbol- \nism of myths, projected onto a cosmic scale. \n\nCreation/birth was inseparable from the figure of the Mother. The \noldest myths made her the divider of waters, maker of heaven and \nearth. When a god came into the picture, he was at first only her \nsubordinate consort, one of the beings she had created: sometimes a \ndisembodied phallus, in the form of a serpent. Late Egyptian gods who \nclaimed to be creators never succeeded in ridding themselves of \nfeminine imagery. For instance, Khepera insisted that he created the \nuniverse alone, "there was no other being who worked with me." Yet \nhe had to say, "I laid a foundation in Maa," meaning the Great Womb, \nthe Goddess Maat. 5 \n\nOften it is said when the god was allowed to create, he became \npuffed up with pride, and began to ignore his Mother and claim sole \nauthorship of the universe. This angered the Goddess. She punished \nhim, bruised his head with her heel, and sent him down to the \nunderworld. 6 (See Eve.) Sumerian creation myths said when the \nGoddess\'s son-spouse began to show signs of hubris she laid the curse \nof exile on him, saying, "Henceforth thou shalt dwell neither in heaven \nnor on earth." 7 This raises all kinds of questions about Middle- \nEastern sacrificial gods who died in expiation of a primal sin, hung on \ntrees or crosses "between heaven and earth." \n\nGnostic creation myths of the early Christian era were still telling \nversions in which the female principle was pre-eminent, which is why \nthey were declared uncanonical. "In his madness," Jehovah claimed to \nbe the only God, because he had forgotten the Mother who brought \nhim into being, according to one source. The Mother of Gods was \nangry that he had impiously sinned against her, and against her other \nchildren, the male and female Immortal Ones. These were the elohim \nof the Book of Genesis. God grouped himself with them, calling the \ngroup "us" (Genesis 3:22). But Bible revisions tended to erase earlier \ndeities, especially female ones. After the centuries of choosing and \nrevising canonical books, nearly every trace of female divinity had been \neliminated from Christian literature. 8 \n\nAs long ago as 1753, Astruc recognized that the Book of Genesis \n\n\n\n184 \n\n\n\ncontains at least two mutually contradictory versions of the creation Creation \nnyth. One version the scholars call E, for it speaks of plural creators, \n\nlohim, male and female deities. Another version is J, for Jehovah _^____^^^_ \n\ntlohim, the God of gods. The two versions disagree in many points: *^^^^^^^^ \n\nE: birds and beasts created before man. \nJ: man created before birds and beasts. \n\nE: birds made of water, along with fishes. \nJ: birds made of earth, along with beasts. \n\nE: man given dominion over the whole earth. \nJ: man placed only in the garden, "to dress it and keep it," like the \nmen created to be farmer-slaves in the Sumerian original. \n\nE: man and woman created together, after the beasts: "male and \nemale created he (they) them, and God (elohim, the deities) blessed \nhem." \n\nJ: man created alone, before beasts and birds; woman made from \nus rib. \n\nE: creation took place in six days. \nJ: creation took place in one day. \n\nE: nothing was said about the Fall, which appeared only in the \nnarrative. \n\nThe Fall was all-important. If it never took place, there was no \nmginal sin, no necessity for redemption, no Savior. Dean Burgon of \n\nhichester said to deny the literal truth of the Genesis story was to \n\'cause the entire scheme of man\'s salvation to collapse." Calvin stood \niquarely behind what he thought the Bible said, and insisted that all \npecies of animals were created at once, in a period of six normal days, \nach with a morning and evening, as stated. Those who disagree with \nlim, he said, "basely insult the Creator," and will meet after death "a \nudge who will annihilate them." 9 \n\nThe clergy\'s notion of investigating the origins of man consisted \n)f studying the Bible to add up the given ages of patriarchs since Adam. \nThis had been done in the 7th century by Isidore of Seville, who \n:ame up with a strange Bible-based view of history: "Joseph lived 105 \n/ears. Greece began to cultivate grain. The Jews were in slavery in \nEgypt 144 years. Atlas discovered astrology. Joshua ruled for 27 years. \nErichthonius yoked horses together. Othniel, 40 years. Cadmus \nntroduced letters into Greece. Deborah, 40 years. Apollo discovered \nhe art of medicine and invented the cithara. Gideon, 40 years. Mercury \nnvented the lyre and gave it to Orpheus." Reasoning on this level \nind never noticing anything odd about the many consecutive reigns of \nK) years Archbishop Usher in 1650 placed the date of creation in \nK)04 b.c. Dr. John Lightfoot, 19th-century Vice-Chancellor of the \n\n\n\n185 \n\n\n\nCreiddylad \n\n\n\nNicolas \n\nMalebranche (1638- \n1715) French \nmetaphysician who \nattempted to \nreconcile Cartesian \nphilosophy with \nCatholic doctrine. \n\n\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, carried the calculations even further: "Man \nwas created by the Trinity on the twenty-third of October, 4004 B.C., a \nnine o\'clock in the morning." 10 \n\nThe absurdity of such reasoning began to be exposed in 1830 \nwhen Sir Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology investigated the earth\'s \nlong-term changes, showing that creation could not have taken place ii \nsix days, nor in six years, nor even six thousand years. Geologists were \nfinding fossils of animals that lived millions of years ago. Bones of \nextinct species were found in caves, mingled with human bones. \nArcheologists found high civilization flourishing in Egypt in 6000 B.C., \nwith evidence of vastly older savage periods. Cuneiform writings \nshowed that the people of Mesopotamia were telling the same story of \ncreation that the Bible told and telling it thousands of years earlier. \n\nChristian scholars tried hard to refute the new findings. Gosse\'s \nOmphalos claimed all fossils, marks of retreating glaciers, lava flows, \nsedimentary rock strata, etc., were created instantaneously by God witl \nan appearance of pre-existence. Chateaubriand said God deliberately \nfooled men with the false appearance of pre-existence in order to test \ntheir faith. Others tried to explain fossils by calling them God\'s \ndeceptions, formed of "lapidific juice" or "seminal air." u \n\nNaturally these crude views had to be abandoned in the end. \nUpholders of the Bible then tried to call the Genesis creation myth \nallegorical, with each "day" corresponding to a large span of prehistori \ntime. This didn\'t work either. The Bible brought plants into being \nbefore the sun, on which plant life depends; made fish and birds befon \n"creeping things" on land which was hardly the case; and produced \n"light" before the only sources of light, sun and moon. \n\nHowever absurd, these myths still maintain a hold on vast numb( \nof people deliberately kept in ignorance by an obsolete fundamentalisr \nEven educated adults sometimes insist that an omniscient god created \nthe world for a purpose of his own. 12 Malebranche came up with an \noriginal notion, which may have helped the public image of his churcl \nbut made his God look rather less than grand. He said God "can love \nonly Himself and therefore act only with the ultimate purpose of \n\nincreasing His glory Thus the sole purpose of the creation was the \n\nincarnation and the formation of the Church." n \n\nI. de Riencourt, 165. 2.

Her fearsome character often had a "virgin mother" side as \nwell, because her trinity of appearances was cyclic. It was said in the \nEast that true lovers of the Goddess must love her ugly "destroyer" \nimages as well as her beautiful ones. The Crone also represented the \nthird (post-menopausal) phase of women\'s lives, and her shrines were \nserved by priestesses in this stage of life. Because it was believed that \nwomen became very wise when they no longer shed the lunar "wise \nblood" but kept it within, the Crone was usually a Goddess of Wisdom. \nMinerva, Athene, Metis, Sophia, and Medusa provide typical \nexamples. \n\n\n\nCronus \n\nTitan god who castrated his father Uranus (Heaven) and was in turn \ndeposed by his own son Zeus. Knowing the danger his children posed, \nCronus tried to prevent it by swallowing them all an early version \nof the Slaughter of the Innocents but Zeus escaped. Cronus was \nconfused with Chronos, "Time," because Time swallows up every- \nthing it brings forth actually a characteristic of Cronus\'s mother-mate, \nRhea Kronia, the Goddess personifying time and fate. She was really \nMother Earth, who gave birth to Cronus; and Rhea, who married him; \nand Hera, who married his son Zeus; the three of them comparable \nto the Mother, Grandmother, and Great-grandmother Goddesses in \nnorthern Europe. 1 See Caste. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,37-40. \n\n\n\n187 \n\n\n\n\nCross Cross \n\nThe "Latin" or "Passion" cross, now the primary symbol of Chris- \n^^^^^^^^^ tianity, was not shown in Christian art until six centuries after Christ. 1 \nBut long before the Christian era it was a pagan religious symbol \nthroughout Europe and western Asia. 2 Early Christians even repudiatec \nthe cross because it was pagan. A church father of the 3rd century, \n\n+ Minucius Felix, indignantly denied that Christians worshipped the \n\ncross: "You it is, ye Pagans, who are the most likely people to adore \nwooden crosses ... for what else are your ensigns, flags, and standards, \nbut crosses gilt and beautiful. Your victorious trophies not only \nrepresent a simple cross, but a cross with a man on it." ? \n\nFrom very ancient times, an effigy of a man hanging on a cross \n\nLatin Cross was set up in fields to protect the crops. The modern scarecrow is a \n\nsurvival of this sacrificial magic, representing the sacred king whose \nblood was supposed to fertilize the earth. He was never abandoned, \neven though every farmer knew that no scarecrow ever really scared a \ncrow. 4 \n\nThe cross was also a male symbol of the phallic Tree of Life; \ntherefore it often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital \ncircle or oval, to signify the sacred marriage. Male cross and female orb \ncomposed the Egyptian "amulet Nefer," or amulet of blessedness, a \ncharm of sexual harmony. 5 \n\nThe so-called Celtic cross, with the crossing of the arms encircled \nby a ring, was another lingam-yoni sign of sexual union, known to the \n\nHindus as Kiakra. 6 Some old Celtic crosses still in existence show \n\nCeltic Cross obvious phallic elements, even to a realistic meatus at the cross\'s tip. 7 \n\nCrosses signified a god\'s love-death even in pre-Columbian art of the \nwestern hemisphere, which showed the Savior carrying his cross, an \nimage very similar to the Christian one. 8 \n\nNo one knows exactly when the cross became associated with \nChristianity. Early images of Jesus represented him not on a cross, \nbut in the guise of the Osirian or Hermetic "Good Shepherd," carrying \n\n+ a lamb. Later, many different kinds of crosses were used as Christian \n\nsymbols. They included the Greek cross of equal arms, the X-shaped St \nAndrew\'s cross, the swastika, the Gnostic Maltese cross, the solar \ncross or Cross of Wotan, and the ansated cross, a development of the \nEgyptian ankh, also found as the Cross of Venus. 9 \n\nGreeks said this cross was "common to the worship of Christ and \n\nGreek Cross Sarapis." 10 The Goddess Isis is shown on the Isiac Table with the \n\ncross in one hand, a lotus seed-vessel in the other, signifying male and \nfemale genitalia. 11 As her consort, the god Sarapis was incarnate in \nPtolemy. The words "Ptolemy the Savior" were followed by a cross on \nthe Damietta Stone. Pious Christian scholars once tried to pretend \nthat this phrase was really a prophecy of the future Christ. 12 \n\nFor a few centuries the emblem of Christ was a headless T-shaped \nTau cross rather than a Latin cross. This may have been copied from \npagan druids, who made Tau crosses of oak trees stripped of their \n\n\n\n188 \n\n\n\nT \n\n\n\nbranches, with two large limbs fastened at the top to represent a Cross \n\nman\'s arms. This was the Thau, or god. 13 \n\nA Tau cross was the sign of the holy day aptly named the ^^^^^^^^ \n\nInvention of the Cross, purporting to commemorate the discovery of \nthe True Cross by the empress Helena, mother of Constantine, in a \ncrypt under the temple of Aphrodite in Jerusalem. 14 After it was \ngenerally replaced by the Latin cross, the Tau cross was reassigned to \nSt. Philip, supposedly crucified on a Tau cross in Phrygia, where he \nwas trying to exorcise the god Mars in the form of a dragon. 15 This \nmeans the Tau cross was the sign of May Day, which the church \nadopted as St. Philip\'s day; and the druidic Thau was confused with the \nMaypole. \n\nThe Invention of the Cross was first heard of long after the lifetime Tau Cross \nof the empress Helena. The date assigned to her "discovery" was \n328 a.d., though no contemporary chronicler thought fit to mention \nsuch a momentous event. The legend said Helena found three \ncrosses under Aphrodite\'s temple, but couldn\'t decide which belonged \nto Christ, which to the two thieves. She had a corpse brought, and \nlaid on each cross in turn. When laid on the right one, the dead man \nsprang up alive. According to an alternative story, the True Cross \ninstantly restored the health of "a noble lady who was near to death." 16 \n\nChristian authorities also claimed the empress found the Holy \nNails and the INRI scroll, but the latter somehow disappeared and \nwas lost for over a thousand years. In 1492 it was miraculously \nrediscovered in the Church of the Holy Cross in Rome, where it \nseemed to have been all the time. Pope Alexander III published a bull \ninfallibly attesting to its authenticity. 17 \n\nThe Invention of the Cross proved enormously useful in the \nMiddle Ages, to account for the veritable forest of splinters of the \nTrue Cross revered in Europe\'s churches. There was so much miracle- \nworking wood of the True Cross that Calvin said it would make "a \nfull load for a good ship." 18 \n\nThe church claimed the True Cross was made of the same wood \nthat grew as the Tree of Life in the garden of Eden. It was carried out \nby Adam, and preserved by all the patriarchs in turn (even riding the \nFlood in Noah\'s ark), for the sole purpose of crucifying the Savior \nwhen he appeared. Gnostic sources added an Oedipal twist: Jesus\'s cross \nwas put together by his father, Joseph the carpenter. Moreover, the \ncross was planted on the very spot where the Tree of Life once grew. \nThe church said it became "the Tree of the Cross, so that whence \ncame death, thence also life might rise again." These absurdities were \nimplicitly believed through the Middle Ages. 19 \n\nMale genitals are still called "the tree of life" by the Arabs, and a \ncross was one of the oldest diagrammatic images of male genitals. \nAmong Christians there was at least some recognition of the cross\'s \nphallic significance. An ancient crucifix at Sancreed in Cornwall was \na spear set upright in a holy vase (the uterine vessel) with two testicle- \n\n\n\n189 \n\n\n\nCrossroads like scrolls appended to its shaft. 20 The cross entering the labyrinth \n\nwas one of the oldest symbols of the lingam-yoni in the west, dating \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^_ back to early Neolithic times. Spiral "feminine" labyrinths penetrated \n\nby a cross occur in prehistoric rock carvings from Crete, at Tintagel in \n\nCornwall, Wier Island in Finland, and Chartres Cathedral. 21 \n\nConscious or not, the phallic connotations of the cross appear even \n\nin the present century. In the 1950\'s a poem in the magazine Wake \n\nsaid: "Christ, I have walked around your erection, The Cross, that \n\nbegot, upon a sky of prayer, a billion men, devoted in humility." 22 \n\nDuring the so-called Age of Faith, the peasants were perhaps not \n\nso devoted in humility to the cross as churchmen wanted. Certain \n\nbrotherhoods of "accursed huntsmen" or "archer wizards" constantly \n\ndefaced roadside crosses, believing they could acquire magic skill with \n\nthe bow by shooting three arrows in succession at a crucifix. 2 * Thus they \n\nopposed the phallic trident of the ancient Lord of the Hunt to \n\nChrist\'s symbol. (See Trident.) Today, the cross is often an article of \n\njewelry, attesting an amuletic function virtually indistinguishable \n\nfrom its magical prophylactic use in antiquity. \n\n1. H.

Kramer & Sprenger, 1 50. \n\n\n\nCrossroads \n\nIn the Greco-Roman world, crossroads were sacred to the elder \nDiana under the name of Hecate Trevia (Hecate of the Three Ways), \nmother of the Lares compitales, "spirits of the crossroads." Travelers \nmade offerings to the Goddess\'s three-faced images, and regular festivals \ncalled Compitalia were celebrated at her roadside shrines. 1 \n\nFour-way crossroads were sometimes dedicated to Hermes, whose \nithyphallic herms stood beside them until replaced by Christians\' \nroadside crosses. However, the Christian sign of the cross was copied \nfrom Hermes\'s cult and traced his sacred numeral 4 on the worship- \nper\'s head and breast. Hermetic crosses were left at the crossroads of \n10th-century Ireland and simply re-interpreted as Christian symbols, \nthough they plainly displayed the twin serpents of the pagan caduceus, \nanother sign of the older deity. 2 \n\nCross, herm, and caduceus merged in northern symbolism with \nthe gallows tree of Odin/ Wotan, "God of the Hanged," which led to \nthe Christian custom of erecting a gallows at crossroads as well as a \ncrucifix. The god on the gallows once played the same role as Jesus \non the cross: a dying-god image rendered the crossroad numinous. Pre- \nChristian Europeans held waymeets, or moots, at crossroads to \ninvoke their deities\' attention to the proceedings; hence a moot point \n\n\n\n190 \n\n\n\nused to be one to be decided at a meet. The Goddess as Mother \nEarth, dispenser of "natural law" and creatress of birth-and-death \ncycles, was always present where the dying god died as the women \nlong remembered. The English monk Aelfric complained of female \ncustoms dedicating newborn infants to the ancient Mother. Women \nwould "go to the crossways and drag their children over the earth, and \nthereby give both themselves and their children to the Devil." 3 \n\nAs the crossroad ceremonies and their deities became diabolized, \nthe Goddess of the waymeet became the queen of witches, who still \nworked magic there. The Key of Solomon said crossroads were the best \nof all places for magical procedures "during the depth and silence of \nthe night." 4 Ghosts of the hanged, of the heathen, and of ancient \naracles still haunted crossroads. Bernard Ragner said a spirit voice \nwould foretell the future to anyone who went to a crossroad at the last \nhour of Christmas Eve. As late as the 1920\'s, English farmers still \nrelieved witches\' sabbats were held at crossroads. Necromantic supersti- \n:ions were encouraged by the custom of burying criminals and \nsuicides in unhallowed ground at crossroads; clergymen said anyone so \njuried would walk as a ghost. Sometimes, such corpses were pinned \ndown with a stake: "A stake was driven through them when deposited at \n:he cross-roads in order to keep the ghost from wandering abroad." 5 \nPresumably, the ghost could be consulted in situ, just as spirits could be \naised from their graves in the churchyard by any necromancer. \n\nThus Hermes and Hecate, who led the souls of the dead in \nantiquity, became dread spirits of "witchcraft" in the same places that \nhey once benevolently ruled. \n\n\n\nCrow \n\n\n\n1.

Wedeck, 153. \n\n\n\nCrow \n\n\\long with the vulture and raven, the carrion-eating crow was \nborthern Europe\'s common symbol of the Death-goddess. Valkyries, \npometimes described as man-eating women, often took totemic form \nas ravens or crows. 1 \n\nAnglo-Danish myths spoke of a witch named Krake (Crow), \ndaughter of the Valkyrie Brunnhilde. Krake was a shape-shifter: at \n:imes a beautiful virgin, at other times a hag, monster, or crow. She \nnamed the Danish king Ragnar Lodbrok (Leather-Breeches), and \njave birth to the hero Sigurd. 2 Sigurd was the same as Siegfried, whose \nnystic lady-love was the Valkyrie Brunnhilde; thus appeared the \name convoluted incestuous relationships found in the oldest myths of \nacred kingship. Again, the Triple Goddess returned as the three \nirophetic daughters of Ragnar and Krake, Fate-weavers who created \nhe magic banner called Raven (Hraefn). 3 \n\nThere was a mythological Kraken associated with the sea, pictured \nis a serpent or water-monster; but this was only another form of the \n\n\n\nKey of Solomon \n\n(Clavicule de Salomon) \nA popular "Black \nBook" or magic book \nmuch used between the \n11th and Bthcentu- \n\n\n\nBernard Ragner \n\nAuthor of Legends and \nCustoms of Christmas, \n1925 \n\n\n\n191 \n\n\n\nCrusades same Death-goddess. The Three Ravens (Kraken) in old ballads were \n\nbirds of doom perching over the slain hero. Sometimes there were \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ m only two of them, as in the ballad of the Twa Corbies (Two Crows), \nwho proposed to pluck out the bonny blue eyes of the slain knight. 4 \n\nSuch manifestations of the Goddess as a crow might be linked wit \nCoronis, "Crow," a death aspect of the pre-Hellenic earth mother \nRhea. Classical mythographers tended to ignore Coronis, rememberinj \nher only as the virgin mother of the healing god Asclepius; but she \nseems to have been another of the Virgin-Crone combinations: Rhea \nKronia as Mother Time who brings death to all things. 5 \n\n1 .

Crusades were usually fough \nby vassals of Christian overlords, including the wealthy clergy. War- \nriors were promised not only the standard soldiers\' spoils, but also \nindulgences, like instant remission of sins and admission to heaven \nguaranteed no matter what crimes the crusader may have committed. \n\nFrom the 8th to 10th centuries, the Holy Roman Empire was \nharassed by Norsemen, who owned many northern trading centers \nand dominated the seas. They also opened negotiations with foreign \npowers in North Africa and the Middle East. In 834, Arabian legates \nvisited Denmark to contract military and trade alliances. 1 The Holy \nRoman Empire saw itself trapped between two anti-Christian forces: \nthe pagan Normans in the northwest, and the Moslem Saracens in the \nsoutheast. Norsemen controlled trade routes through the Danube \nand Black Sea to the Turks, and were acquiring hoards of Arabic silver \ngold, and gems. They also sailed the Atlantic coasts down to Gibral- \ntar, and founded colonies in Libya. The Kingdom of God was nearly \nencircled. \n\nPope Urban II tried to solve the problem by initiating crusades in \nthe east, on the pretext of converting the Saracens\' possessions in the \n"Holy Land" into Christian fiefs. In 1095 he instigated the People\'s \nCrusade as a combination of penitential pilgrimage and a war of \nconquest. It was advertised throughout Europe. All who participated \nwere placed above restrictions of law, and promised forgiveness of \nsins and eternal bliss in heaven without any time spent in purgatory. \n\nA rabble of some 1 50,000 to 300,000 persons, mostly the dregs c \nsociety mixed with military mercenaries, set out across southern \nEurope, killing, torturing, and looting as they went. One division \nslaughtered 10,000 Jews in the Rhineland, then forgot about the \nHoly Land and dispersed. Two other divisions did so much harm in \nHungary that native soldiers rose up against them and destroyed \nthem all. Multitudes died along the way, of sickness, hunger, or injurie \n\n\n\n192 \n\n\n\n\nbrought on by their violence. A remnant survived to plunder the too- Crusades \n\nhospitable Greeks, then to enter Constantinople. There, stronger \n\ncrusaders sold off the weaker ones as slaves, to finance their own ^^^^^_^_^_ \n\nprovisions. Finally, a remaining 7,000 or so crossed the Bosporus and \n\nwere attacked by the Turks, who soon killed them all. 2 \n\nOne might think the fate of Pope Urban\'s crusade would have \ndiscouraged future experiments of this kind. Not so. It seems to have \nbeen an idea whose time had come. \n\nLater crusades were better organized, with more experienced \nsoldiers and fewer penitential pilgrims. Their primary motive was \nloot. For the next 400 years, Christian knights went forth to astonish the \nSaracens with their intellectual naYvete and their military sophistica- \ntion, developed in a feudal society based on warfare. \n\nThe Crusaders in general, in spite of their sacred cause, behaved like \nhighway robbers. The first host which set out in 1095, and was \nannihilated by the Turks at Nicaea, killed, burned and pillaged all they \nencountered. The army commanded by Godfrey de Bouillon massa- \ncred the entire population of Jerusalem (1098). The astuteness of Venice \nturned aside the fourth Crusade upon Constantinople, and the sack of \nthis city is a dark blot on the history of Western Christendom (1204). It \nwas abominably ravaged, and the very church of St. Sophia was the \nscene of bloody and sacrilegious orgies. * \n\nA contemporary chronicler said Jerusalem withstood a month\'s \nsiege. Upon its fall, crusaders rode into the city with their horses wading \n"knee-deep in the blood of disbelievers." Jews were herded into their \nsynagogues and burned alive. On the next day, the knights slaughtered \n"a great multitude of people of every age, old men and women, \nmaidens, children and mothers with infants, by way of a solemn \nsacrifice" to Jesus. 4 At the battle of Acre, Richard Coeur de Lion \nviolated his pledge of truce, and had his hostages slaughtered and flayed. \n"His conduct stands in strong contrast with the dignity and forbear- \nance of Saladin, before whose eyes the outrage was committed, and who \nwould not stoop to retaliate on his dastardly opponent." 5 \n\nOnce the crusading system was established, it was turned on other \nenemies of the church closer to home and became the standard \nmethod for dealing with European heathens and heretics. Between \n1236 and 1283 a crusade of extermination was preached against the \npagan Prussians by Pope Honorius, and carried out by the Teutonic \nKnights. The Christian Brethren of the Sword similarly converted \nLivonia and Courland. Armies of the Christian Dukes of Poland forced \nthe Wends to accept Christian baptism and vassalage. The Lithua- \nnians stubbornly clung to their paganism to the end of the 14th century, \nbut eventually they too were Christianized by the sword. 6 \n\nIt was noticed in the 1 3th century that the semi-barbarous Ste- \ndingers of the lower Weser river maintained their ancient tribal \nsystem, paid no attention to the church, and contributed no tithes. Pope \nGregory IX sent bulls to the bishops of Minden, Lubeck, and \n\n\n\n193 \n\n\n\nCrusades Verden, ordering crusades against these recalcitrant peasants, whom he \n\ndescribed as heretics because they consulted wise-women, made \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ waxen images, and worshipped "demons." Crusaders were promised \nblanket pardon for their sins. However, the Stedingers fought back \nstubbornly, and several campaigns against them failed. At last in 1234 a \nhuge army marched into their land, ravaged every home with fire and \nsword, and wiped them out. Their property was divided between the \nchurch and the barons. 7 \n\nIt has been estimated that Europe was Christianized at a cost of \nabout 8 million to 10 million lives. 8 Even after nominal conversion, \nthere was much residual resistance to the new cult, which was alien and \nunappealing to the people it was imposed on. The clergy claimed \nauthority from an unfamiliar eastern savior and his God, defaming all \nthe pagans\' local, ancestral deities many worshipped since the \nNeolithic age as demons. Moreover, familiar laws and lifestyle were \ndeclared wholly sinful. It\'s hardly surprising that there arose heresy \nafter heresy to confront the conquering church, which became increas- \ningly fanatical in its dictatorial policies, yet in the end failed to \novercome the people\'s need to assert their own religious heterodoxy. 9 \nMany refused to give up their pagan Goddess, or their notion that \nsexuality contained an element of the divine. Many remembered a time, \nnot so long before, when "holy communion" was a taste of divine \nbliss through sensual pleasures: an idea that was especially prevalent in \nthe south of France. \n\nCrusades against the Catharan or Albigensian heretics of southern \nFrance were particularly virulent, since these people were prosperous \nenough to attract plunderers, and bitterly opposed to the Roman \nchurch, which they called the Synagogue of Satan. They condemned \nits worship of holy images as idolatry, denied the power of its sacra- \nments, scoffed at the Trinity, insisted on reading the Bible for \nthemselves, and revived the old Gnostic belief that the Jehovah wor- \nshipped by the Roman church was a demonic demiurge who created \nthe world of matter to entrap souls in wickedness. Pope Alexander III \nanathematized the Catharan communities and sent ecclesiastical \njudges to investigate their offenses in 1 163. Of these judges, the word \n"inquisitor" was used for the first time. 10 \n\nIn 1209 Pope Innocent II preached a great crusade against the \nFrench rebels. This has gone down in history as the Albigensian \ncrusade, one of the bloodiest chapters in Christianity\'s past. 11 Half of \nFrance was exterminated. When the papal legate was asked how \nheretics were to be distinguished from the faithful, he replied, "Kill \nthem all; God will know his own." 12 \n\nSoon the legate was able to report that in Beziers alone, "nearly \ntwenty thousand human beings perished by the sword. And after the \nmassacre the town was plundered and burnt, and the revenge of God \nseemed to rage over it in a wonderful manner." The killing of \nheretics went on continually for twenty years, and it has been estimated \nthat more than a million were slaughtered. 13 \n\n194 \n\n\n\nThis was more than a police action against heresy. It was the Cu Chulainn \ndestruction of a whole civilization that had the misfortune to be more \nadvanced than the rest of Europe. \n\nIn the twelfth century, the south of France had been the most civilized \nland in Europe. There commerce, industry, art, science, had been far \nin advance of the age. The cities had won virtual self-government, were \nproud of their wealth and strength, jealous of their liberties, and self- \nsacrificing in their patriotism. The nobles, for the most part, were \ncultivated men, poets themselves or patrons of poetry, who had learned \nthat their prosperity depended on the prosperity of their subjects, and that \nmunicipal liberties were a safeguard rather than a menace to the wise \nruler. The Crusaders came, and their unfinished work was taken up and \nexecuted to the bitter end by the Inquisition. It left a ruined and \nimpoverished country, with shattered industries and a failing commerce. \nThe native nobles were broken by confiscation and replaced by \nstrangers A people of rare gifts had been tortured, decimated, humili- \nated, despoiled. . . . The precocious civilization which had promised to \nlead Europe in the path of culture was gone, and to Italy was transmitted \nthe honour of the Renaissance. H \n\nCatholic writers made many efforts to justify the destruction. \n\nApologists like Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay used vituperation, calling the \n\nCatharan opinions "this detestable pest ... the poison of superstitious \n\ninfidelity." He said Toulouse was "marvelously and miserably infected \n\nwith this plague . . . almost all the barons of Provence had become \n\nharborers and defenders of heretics." In the 19th century, Abbe \n\nVacandard said, "The Church, after all, was only defending herself. \n\nThe Cathari sought to wound her mortally by attacking her doctrine, \n\nher hierarchy and her apostolicity. She would have been ruined if \n\ntheir perfidious insinuations, which brought violent disturbance into \n\nmen\'s minds, had prevailed in the end." 15 It has ever been the \n\nchurch\'s habit to regard any skepticism concerning its pronouncements \n\nas "violent disturbance"; but of course, all the bloodletting was in \n\nvain. Skepticism did prevail in the end. \n\n1.0xenstierna,76. 2. H. Smith, 252-53. 3. Reinach, 295. 4. H. Smith, 253. \n\n5. Briffault 3, 392. 6. Reinach, 294. 7. Lea unabridged, 656-60. 8. H.

It was said of him that he was "begotten by a man that \nwas not a man; his father was reared by his mother as a child, a child \nwhich died and did not die." J In other words, he was a pre-Christian \nChrist figure, God-begotten on the "Mother of God," of one \nsubstance with his own Father. \n\nCu Chulainn received the death-curse of the Goddess Macha, and \ndied bound to a sacred pillar, pierced by arrows, his blood fertilizing \n\n\n\n195 \n\n\n\nCuckold the earth. Other Celtic heroes died the same way. Their idols were \n\nsometimes interpreted as images of St. Sebastian, now officially \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^_ viewed as an over-hasty canonization of a Gaulish heathen savior. 2 \n\nCu Chulainn received his education in battle skills from Skadi, or \nScatha, the same northern death-goddess as the Queen of Skye. His \ndestiny or "weird" was to kill his rival on the "precursor day of spring," \nso the shedding of blood would "allow spring to enter." 3 The same \nidea of bloodshed to facilitate the return of spring is found in Teutonic \nmyths of Skadi. 4 \n\nCu means "dog," a common title of Celtic chieftains (as in \nCunobelin) identified with the underworld Lord of Death. Like \nEgypt\'s Anubis, the dead hero might become the canine gatekeeper \ncharged with admitting souls to paradise, as shown on the Gundes- \ntrup Cauldron. 5 The dog represented reincarnation. So did Cu \nChulainn, who was promised that "his rebirth would be of himself." \nHe was sent to Emania, the realm of the dead in the moon. 6 He may \nhave been the original of the British legend that the man in the moon \nis really a dog, who acts as a messenger of death. 7 \n\nThe virgin mother of Cu Chulainn conceived him by eating his \nsoul in the form of a fly. This Celtic soul-symbol originated in the \nMiddle East, where the Lord of Death was Baal-Zebub (Beelzebub), \nLord of Flies. Like most pagan gods, Cu Chulainn was a shape- \nshifter. He could be an insect, animal, or man at different stages in his \nlife cycle. Such changes from one shape to another were based on the \nancient Indo-European idea of metempsychosis. The Protean hero \neven adapted his shape to Christianity; the medieval Irish insisted that \nhe was an avatar of Christ. 8 \n\nLater Irish writers pretended that Cu Chulainn was not ignomini- \nously trussed up to his pillar as a sacrifice, in the manner of the old \ngods. They thought it important to prove that he fell in battle. There- \nfore they invented the legend that, wounded and knowing himself \ndoomed, Cu Chulainn tied himself to the sacred pillar so he couldn\'t \nfall down before his enemies, who were piercing him with arrows, but \nrather "died with his honor unimpaired." 9 \n\nl.Rees,235. 2.

A 16th-century writer \ntherefore described the cuckold as "cornute," that is, "as soundly \narmed for the head, as either Capricorn, or the stoutest horned sign in \nthe Zodiac." 3 See Horns. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 80. 2. Frazer, G.B., 142. 3. Hazlitt, 160. \n\n\n\nCunt \n\nDerivative of the Oriental Great Goddess as Cunti, or Kunda, the \nYoni of the Uni-verse. 1 From the same root came county, kin, and kind \n(Old English cyn, Gothic kuni). Related forms were Latin cunnus, \nMiddle English cunte, Old Norse and Frisian kunta, Basque cuna. \nOther cognates are "cunabula," a cradle, or earliest abode; "Cun- \nina," a Roman Goddess who protected children in the cradle; \n"cunctipotent," all-powerful (i.e., having cunt-magic); "cunicle," a \nhole or passage; "cuniculate," penetrated by a passage; "cundy," a \ncoverted culvert; also cunning, kenning, and ken: knowledge, learn- \ning, insight, remembrance, wisdom. Cunt is "not slang, dialect or any \nmarginal form, but a true language word, and of the oldest stock." 2 \n\n"Kin" meant not only matrilineal blood relations, but also a cleft or \ncrevice, the Goddess\'s genital opening. A Saharan tribe called Kun- \ntahs traced their descent from this holy place. 3 Indian "kundas" were \ntheir mothers\' natural children, begotten out of wedlock as gifts of the \nGoddess Kunda. 4 Of old the name applied to girls, as in China where \ngirls were once considered children of their mothers only, having no \nnatural connection with fathers. 5 \n\nIn ancient writings, the word for "cunt" was synonymous with \n"woman," though not in the insulting modern sense. An Egyptolo- \ngist was shocked to find the maxims of Ptah-Hotep "used for \'woman\' a \nterm that was more than blunt," though its indelicacy was not in the \neye of the ancient beholder, only in that of the modern scholar. 6 \n\nMedieval clergymen similarly perceived obscenity in female-geni- \ntal shrines of the pagans: holy caves, wells, groves. Any such place \nwas called cunnus diaboli, "devilish cunt." Witches who worshipped \nthere sometimes assumed the name of the place, like the male witch \nJohannes Cuntius mentioned by Thomas More. 7 "Under painful cir- \ncumstances" this witch died at the hands of witch hunters, but it was \nsaid he was resurrected, and came back to earth as a lecherous incubus. 8 \n\nSacred places identified with the world-cunt sometimes embar- \nrassed Victorian scholars who failed to understand their earlier \n\n\n\n197 \n\n\n\nCupid meaning. A.H. Clough became a laughing-stock among Gaelic-speak- \n\nCurse, Mother\'s ing students when he published a poem called Toper-na-Fuosich, \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m literally "bearded well," a Gaelic place-name for a cunt-shrine. The \nsynonym "twat" was ignorantly used by another Victorian poet, \nRobert Browning, in the closing lines of his Pippa Passes: \n\nThen, owls and bats, \n\nCowls and twats, \n\nMonks and nuns, in a cloisters moods, \n\nAdjourn to the oak-stump pantry! \n\nEditors of the Oxford English Dictionary hesitantly asked \n\nBrowning where he learned the word. He said it came from a bawdy \n\nbroadside poem of 1659: "They talked of his having a Cardinal\'s Hat; \n\nThey\'d send him as soon an Old Nun\'s Twat." Browning thought the \n\nword meant a wimple, or other headgear corresponding to "hat." 9 \n\n1. G.R. Scott, 188. 2. Dames, 110-14. 3. Briffault 1, 604. \n\n4. Mahanirvanatantra, 289. 5.

In the same way, Latin \ncaritas was altered from sensual or sexual giving to the modern \n"charity," giving of money. \n\nRenaissance art made emanations of Cupid into amoretti, "little \nloves," shown as winged babies. But ancient talismans of Cupid were \nnot babies; they were winged phalli of bronze, ivory, or wood, which \ngave rise to an Italian slang term for the penis, uccello, "little bird." \' \n\n1. Young, 74. \n\n\n\nCurse, Mother\'s \n\nIn ancient Asiatic belief, a mother\'s curse meant certain death. All \ndeath was brought about by the Goddess\'s word of destruction, as all \nbirth was brought about by her word of creation. By virtue of \nmotherhood, any woman could tap the verbal power of the Goddess. \nThe Markandaya Purana says, "for all curses there is some remedy; \nbut there is nothing anywhere that can dispel the curse of those who \nhave been cursed by a mother." J Similarly, the biblical Hannah \nrejoiced when she became a mother, saying, "My mouth is enlarged \nover mine enemies" (1 Samuel 2:1) because maternity gave her \ncurses an irresistible power. \n\n\n\n198 \n\n\n\nHomer tells the story of Meleager, cursed by his mother for \nmurdering her brothers. Falling on her knees, she knocked the earth \nwith her fists and called upon the underground Goddess. "And the \nFury that walks in the dark and has inexorable thoughts heard her \nfrom Erebus." 2 The Fury told Meleager\'s mother to burn his soul in \nthe form of a wand, so he was stricken with a fever, and soon died. 3 \n\nWitchcraft of this sort was not even necessary the curse alone \ncould kill. The Greek word for the effect of a mother\'s curse was \nmiasma, a kind of spiritual pollution bringing slow but sure destruction. \nMiasma could pursue members of a clan for many generations. The \ntragic family history of Orestes might be traced to a curse laid by the \nGoddess Artemis herself on his ancestor Atreus, who dared to \nwithhold the golden fleece of a sacrificial lamb she had sent, using it to \nconfirm his right to rule. 4 \n\nGods launched curses too, and some of them were spectacular, like \nthose with which Yahweh threatened all who disobeyed him: a \ncombination of pestilence, fever, consumption, inflammation, blasting, \nmildew, extreme burning, emerods (hemorrhoids), the scab, the itch, \nthe botch of Egypt, madness, blindness, slavery, great plagues of long \ncontinuance, and barrenness of the land (Deuteronomy 28). How- \never, the gods\' curses seemed not to arouse as much terror as those of \nGoddess or Mother. \n\nThe terrible vehicle of the feminine curse was menstrual blood, \nstill called The Curse. To "damn" has been linked with the Hebrew \ndam, "blood," specifically mother-blood, the fluid of the womb, an- \nciently thought to create one\'s very soul and destroy it. Dam was \nalso synonymous with "mother" (ma-dam, my mother). Elder women \npast menopause were thought to be the most efficient cursers, on the \nancient theory that their "wise blood" was retained in their bodies, \ngiving them numinous power to make their words come true. 5 This \nwas why medieval Europe believed any destructive charm having \nmenstrual blood as one of its ingredients must be irresistible, and why \nelder women were viewed as prototypical witches, their words or even \ntheir glances heavy with dread. \n\nFathers of the church even wooed converts with the assurance that \nthe Christian faith was strong enough to overcome a mother\'s curse, \nthe most powerful curse known to man. St. Augustine claimed that \nsome children cursed by their mother were afflicted by constant \nweakness and tremors, but St. Stephen converted them to Christianity, \nand they were completely cured of the effects of the curse. 6 \n\nEastern sages believed the feminine power of the curse must be \nallayed not so much by opposing it with a patriarchal religion, as by \ntreating women well, so they would not be inclined to use their \ndestructive power. The Laws of Manu said: \n\nWomen must be honored and adorned by their fathers, brothers, hus- \nbands, and brothers-in-law, who desire their own welfare. Where \nwomen are honored, there the gods are pleased, but where they are not \n\n\n\nCurse, Mother\'s \n\n\n\nLaws of Manu \n\nPost-Vedic treatise on \nholy law, composed or \ncollected some time \nbetween the 2nd \ncentury B.C. and the \n2nd century a.d. \n\n\n\n199 \n\n\n\nCut hbert , Saint honored, no sacred rite yields rewards. Where the female relations live \n\nin grief, the family soon wholly perishes; but that family where they are \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not unhappy ever prospers. The houses on which female relations, not \n\nbeing duly honored, pronounce a curse, perish completely, as if destroyed \nby magic. 7 \n\nThis advice came from the place northern Aryans called Mut- \nspellheim, the Home of the Mother\'s Curse, in "the hot lands of the \nsouth." According to the Scandinavian prophecy of doomsday, the \nMutspell would fall upon the violent patriarchal gods who ignored \nancient tribal bonds and rules of morality, and instituted cruel \nwarfare. The result of the Mother\'s Curse would be the death of all \ngods, their Gotterdammerung or Going-Into-the-Shadow; thus it \nseemed the Mother\'s word of destruction meant the end of the world. 8 \n\nChristian Gnostic writings reveal the same belief in a world- \ndestroying curse from a Great Mother disgusted with the cruel \nbehavior of the gods she created. In her anger, the Goddess would send \na great power from the place "where the firmament of woman is \nsituated," the Gnostic equivalent of Mutspellheim. "Then she will drive \nout the gods of Chaos whom she had created together with the first \nFather. She will cast them down to the abyss. They will be wiped out by \ntheir own injustice." 9 \n\nMyths in general suggest that a mother\'s curse was the necessary \ninstrument of destruction for any god, even a Savior-son, most of \nwhom were solemnly cursed before immolation. 10 Since a mother\'s \ncurse was immutable, no guilt accrued to the executioners who \ncarried out sacrificial killings in ancient dramas of death and resurrec- \ntion. Mythology bears out the archetypal idea that one who gives \nbirth has unlimited power over the life so given, and may retain control \nof that life\'s duration. \n\nAs a rule therefore, death curses usually employed female symbol- \nism. Typical was the curse of the "black fast," utilizing a black hen, \nonce sacred to the Queen of the Shades as destructive twin of the \nMother of the World Egg. The curse was accomplished by the \noperator and the black hen fasting together, every Friday for nine weeks \n(the Goddess\'s day and number). After this, an accursed one was sure \nto die. 11 \n\n1. O\'Flaherty, 68. 2. Cavendish, P.E., 122. 3. Graves, CM. 1, 266. \n\n4. Graves, CM. 2, 44. 5. Gifford, 26. 6. de Voragine, 57. 7.

He was periodically displayed, and always \npronounced remarkably fresh. His remains were last viewed in 1827 \nand found to be as plump and rosy as ever almost as if he were a \nwaxwork, if it were possible to suspect the church of perpetrating \nsuch a hoax. \n\nOddly enough, while his incorruptible body lay in Durham Cathe- \ndral, St. Cuthbert also lived on at the bottom of the sea, as a marine \nsmith-god who forged beads for rosaries in his ocean cave. Crinoid shells \nwashed up on Northumbrian beaches after storms were known as St. \nCuthbert\'s Beads. 1 \n\nThere was also a St. Cuthbert\'s Well, located near the famous \nEden Hall, whose "luck" talisman was a sacred chalice inherited from \nthe fairies. 2 The waters of St. Cuthbert\'s Well were credited with the \nusual miraculous powers of healing and preserving health. \n\n1.

Her triumphal procession \nwas "later glorified by marvelous legends, and the poets told of \nedifying miracles that had occurred during Cybele\'s voyage." l \n\nHer holy aniconic image was carried to Rome by order of the \nCumaean Sybil, a personification of the same cave-dwelling Goddess \nherself. As the Great Mother of all Asia Minor, she was worshipped \nespecially on Mt. Ida, Mt. Sipylus, Cyzicus, Sardis, and Pessinus in \nGalatia. 2 \n\nHer festivals were called ludi, "games." 3 A highlight of her \nworship was the Taurobolium, baptism in the blood of a sacred bull, \nwho represented her dying-god consort, Attis. Her temple stood on the \nVatican, where St. Peter\'s basilica stands today, up to the 4th century \na.d. when Christians took it over. 4 She was one of the leading deities of \nRome in the heyday of the mystery cults, along with Hecate and \nDemeter of Eleusis. 5 \n\nOther names for Cybele assimilated her to every significant form \nof the Great Goddess. She was the Berecynthian Mother (genetrix \nBerecynthia). She was Rhea Lobrine, Goddess of sacred caves, known \nas her "marriage bowers." 7 She was called Augusta, the Great One; \nAlma, the Nourishing One; Sanctissima, the Most Holy One. Roman \nemperors like Augustus, Claudius, and Antoninus Pius regarded her \nas the supreme deity of the empire. Augustus established his home \nfacing her temple, and looked upon his wife, the empress Livia \nAugusta, as an earthly incarnation of her. 8 The emperor Julian wrote an \nimpassioned address to her: \n\nWho is then the Mother of the Gods? She is the source of the intellectual \nand creative gods, who in their turn guide the visible gods; she is both \n\n\n\nVariations of \nCybele\'s name \nKubaba, Kuba, \nKube have been \nlinked with the \nKa\'aba stone at Mecca, \na meteoric "cube" \nthat bore the Goddess\'s \nsymbol and was once \nknown as the Old \nWoman. 6 \n\n\n\n201 \n\n\n\nCyboread the mother and the spouse of mighty Zeus; she came into being next to \n\nCynosure and together with the great creator; she is in control of every form of \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ life, and the cause of all generation; she easily brings to perfection all \n\nthings that are; she is the motherless maiden, enthroned at the side of \nZeus, and in very truth is the Mother of all the Gods. 9 \n\nFathers of the Christian church vehemently disagreed. St. Augus- \ntine called Cybele a harlot mother, "the mother, not of the gods, but \nof the demons." 10 \n\nOne of her names, Antaea, made her the mythical mother of the \nearth-giant Antaeus, who was invincible as long as his feet remained \nin contact with his Mother\'s body, the earth. Heracles conquered him \nby holding him up in the air. Churchmen believed the powers of \nwitches came from the same sort of contact with Mother Earth. \nArresting officers often carried witches to prison in a large basket, so \ntheir feet would not touch the ground. 11 \n\nThere was a Christian sect founded in the 2nd century a.d. by \nMontanus (Mountain man), a priest of Cybele, who identified Attis \nwith Christ. Montanus maintained that women were agents of the \nGoddess, and could preach and prophesy as well as men. This \ncontradicted the orthodox Pauline sect, which followed St. Paul\'s rule \nthat women must never speak publicly on holy subjects. 12 During the \n4th century, Montanist Christianity was declared a heresy, and many of \nits adherents were slain. Some Montanists in Asia Minor were locked \nin their churches and burned alive. 13 \n\n1. Cumont, O.R.R.P., 47 2. Encyc. Brit., "Great Mother of the Gods." \n\n3. James, 246. 4.

Danu, Danuna, Dana \n\nDanae \n\n\n\nEponymous Great Mother of the Danes and many other peoples, \nsuch as the Danaans, the Danaids, the biblical Danites, and the Irish \nTuatha De Danann, "people of the Goddess Dana." l The Russians \n\n\n\ncalled her Dennitsa, "Greatest of all Goddesses." A medieval Russian \nexorcism said: "In the morning let us rise and pray to God and \nDennitsa." 4 \n\nAs Danu-Ana, or Anu, she led the Irish trinity of Fates, collective- \nthe Morrigan. Mountains in Kerry are still named after her breasts, \nthe Paps of Anu. 5 Under the name of Don she was masculinized as a \n"king" of Dublin in late Irish legend; but the same "king" was also \ncalled Mother of the Gods. 6 Sometimes the Irish called her Domnu, a \nmother Goddess personifying the Deep. 7 \n\nClassical Greek mythology humanized the Goddess Danae, in \nmuch the same way as the Bible humanized Earth Mother Eve; the \ntwo were the same deity, fructified by the Heaven-father\'s seminal rain. \nThe Hellenic Danae was a virgin princess impregnated by Zeus\'s \nshower of golden rain that is, urine, to which primitives sometimes \nattributed the same reproductive power as semen. As result of this \nbeneficial moistening, Danae bore the hero Perseus, who annoyed \nfathers of the Christian church by being as verifiably god-begotten \nand virgin-born and their own savior. 9 But Danae, like Eve, was really \nanother name for the universal Triple Goddess, also called Dam-kina \nby the Sumerians, Dinah by the Hebrews, and Danu or Dunnu in \nBabylon. The Greeks knew of three Danaids, known as Telchines or \n"Enchanters," who founded the three chief cities of Rhodes. 10 \n\nWriters of the Old Testament disliked the Danites, whom they \ncalled serpents (Genesis 49:17). Nevertheless, they adopted Dan-El \nor Daniel, a Phoenician god of divination, and transformed him into a \nHebrew prophet. His magic powers like those of the Danites emanat- \ned from the Goddess Dana and her sacred serpents. He served as court \nastrologer and dream-interpreter for both the Persian king Cyrus, and \nthe Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 1:21, 2:1), indicating \nthat "Daniel" was not a personal name but a title, like the Celtic one: \n"a person of the Goddess Dana." \n\n1.

To the \nHindus she was \n"Waters of Heaven," \nmother of the Vedic \ngods. 3 \n\nIn Saxon myth, \nDanu-Ana became \nBlack Annis, or \nAnna of the Angles, or \nthe Blue Hag, or \nAngurboda, mother of \nHel. An ancient \ncave-shrine at Dane\'s \nHill in Leicestershire \nwas her dwelling place, \nknown as Black \nAnnis\'s Bower. 8 \n\n\n\nDaphne \n\n"Laurel," the plant of prophecy chewed by the Goddess\'s priestesses \nin the vale of Tempe, until Apollo\'s cult replaced hers, and restricted \nlaurel-chewing to the Delphic Pythoness. 1 The Goddess\'s original \nname was Daphoene, "Bloody One," in early times when her Maenads \nwere still performing blood sacrifices. \n\nOrgiastic Daphne entered classical mythology as a purified virgin \nwho was saved from rape by Apollo through a transformation into a \nlaurel tree in the nick of time. The myth seems to have been suggested \nby an icon showing the Goddess\'s face looking down from the \nbranches of a laurel tree upon the sacred king immolated at her feet. \n\n\n\n207 \n\n\n\nDark Age Laurel remained the plant of inspiration and poetic frenzy. Laurel \n\ncrowns were given to the best poets, who were then called "laureate"- \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ laurel-crowned. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,81. \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\nWestern histories have put forth many theories about the fall of \nRome and attributed the onset of the Dark Age to a wide variety of \ncauses, except the one cause that may have had more to do with it \nthan any other: Christianity. 1 By denying women\'s spiritual significance \nand forbidding Goddess worship, the church alienated both sexes \nfrom their pagan sense of unity with the divine through each other. \n\nChristians said one of the diabolic symptoms of the oncoming end \nof the world was "the spread of knowledge," which they endeavored \nto check with wholesale book-burnings, destruction of libraries and \nschools, and opposition to education for laymen. 2 By the end of the \n5th century, Christian rulers forcibly abolished the study of philosophy, \nmathematics, medicine, and geography. Lactantius said no Christian \nshould study astronomy. Pope Gregory the Great denounced all secular \neducation as folly and wickedness, and forbade Christian laymen to \nread even the Bible. He burned the library of the Palatine Apollo, "lest \nits secular literature distract the faithful from the contemplation of \nheaven." 3 \n\nIn the church\'s view, every opinion except its own was heretical \nand devilish, likely to raise doubts in the minds of believers. There- \nfore, pagan intellectuals and teachers were persecuted and schools were \nclosed. Christian emperors commanded the burning of all books of \nthe philosophers, as Theodosius said, "for we would not suffer any of \nthose things so much as to come to men\'s ears, which would tend to \nprovoke God to wrath and offend the minds of the pious." After years of \nvandalism and destruction, St. John Chrysostom proudly boasted, \n"Every trace of the old philosophy and literature of the ancient world \nhas vanished from the face of the earth." 4 \n\nIt was almost true. Christian persecutions left "but few fragments \nof a vast liturgy and religious literature of paganism which would have \ncast many a ray of light on the origins of our own faith; and demolished \nholy places and beautiful temples such as the world shall never rear \nagain." 5 After temples were destroyed, monks and hermits were settled \nin the ruins to defile the site with their excrement, and to prevent \nreconstruction. 6 \n\nRulers melted down bronze, gold, and silver artworks for money. \nPeasants broke up marble gods and goddesses and fed their pieces \ninto limekilns for mortar. 7 It is recorded that 4th-century Rome had 424 \ntemples, 304 shrines, 80 statues of deities in precious metal, 64 \nstatues of ivory, 3,700 statues in bronze, and thousands in marble. By \n\n\n\n208 \n\n\n\nthe next century, nearly all of them were gone. The historian \nEunapius, a hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries, watched the \ndestruction and wrote that the empire was being overwhelmed by a \n"fabulous and formless darkness mastering the loveliness of the world." 8 \n\nRoman society was losing its cohesiveness and discipline, with the \nusual symptoms of social decline: runaway inflation, shortages, crime, \napathy, and a discouraged middle class taxed to the breaking point to \nsupport a top-heavy, stagnant bureaucracy. 9 Most Christians came \nnot from that middle class, but from the lower elements of society, \ntaking advantage of lawless times to grab what they could. Celsus said \nthe Christians invited into their ranks "whosoever is a sinner or \nunintelligent, or a fool, in a word, whosoever is god-forsaken, him the \nkingdom of God will receive. Now whom do you mean by the sinner \nbut the wicked: thief, housebreaker, poisoner, temple robber, grave \nrobber?. . . Jesus, they say, was sent to save sinners; was he not sent to \nhelp those who have kept themselves free from sin? They pretend \nthat God will save the unjust man if he repents and humbles himself. \nThe just man who has held steadily from the cradle in the ways of \nvirtue he will not look upon." 10 \n\nBertrand Russell described the philosophical outlook of St. Jerome: \n"He thinks the preservation of virginity more important than victory \nover the Huns and Vandals and Goths. Never once do his thoughts turn \nto any possible measure of practical statesmanship; never once does \nhe point out the evils of the fiscal system, or of reliance on an army \ncomposed of barbarians. The same is true of Ambrose and Augus- \ntine. ... It is no wonder that the Empire fell into ruin." n \n\nConventional histories presented a picture of early Christians as \npeaceable souls, unjustly persecuted. This picture could only have \narisen because historical writing was monopolized by the church for \nmany centuries, and there was no compunction about changing or \nfalsifying records. Pagan Rome didn\'t persecute religious minorities. \n"It never disputed the existence or reality of other deities, and the \naddition of a new member to the Pantheon was a matter of indiffer- \nence. . . . [A]U deities of all peoples were regarded as but manifestations \nof the one supreme deity." Dionysus, Venus, and Priapus were \nhonored co-residents of the temple of Isis in Pompeii. Italian and Greek \ndeities mixed together in the temple of Mithra at Ostia. 12 All deities \nwere willing to co-exist except the Christian one. The Christian church \nalone "has always held the toleration of others to be the persecution \nof itself." 1J As early as 382 a.d., the church officially declared that any \nopposition to its own creed in favor of others must be punished by the \ndeath penalty. 14 \n\nContrary to the conventional mythology, Christians were not \nprosecuted under Roman law for being Christians but for committing \ncivil crimes. 15 They caused riots, "often tumultuously interrupted the \npublic worship, and continually railed against the national religion." 16 \nThey seem to have been guilty of vandalism and arson. The Great Fire \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\n\n\n209 \n\n\n\nDaik Age in 64 a.d. was set by Christians who were "anxiously waiting for the \n\nworld to end by fire and who did at times start fires in order to prompt \n^^^^^^^^^^^ God." 17 Crying that the world would end at any moment, Christian \nfanatics sometimes developed the notion that starting the fires of the \nfinal holocaust would redound to their credit in heaven. 18 At least one \nsaint was canonized for no particular reason other than having been an \narsonist: St. Theodore, whose sole claim to fame was burning down \nthe temple of the Mother of the Gods. 19 \n\nThe decline of Roman civilization and the onset of the Dark Age \nwas the period Gilbert Murray characterized as the western world\'s \nfailure of nerve. It marked the transition of the west from a position of \ncultural leadership to one of regressed barbarism, and transformed \nEurope into what is now known as an "undeveloped area." 20 Intellect, \ntaste, and imagination disappeared from art and literature. Rather \nthan broadening the western mind, its church crippled that mind by \nallowing childish superstitions to flourish in an atmosphere of igno- \nrance and unreason. 21 Suppression of the teaching priestess or alma \nmaterled to an eclipse of education in general. \n\nMany scholars fled from Christian persecutions eastward to Iran, \nwhere the Sassanid king helped them found a school of medicine and \nscience. This was the world\'s intellectual capital for two centuries. 22 \nAlready in 529, when Justinian closed the Athenian schools, Helle- \nnistic learning had been dispersed to Sassanian Persia, Gupta India, ant \nCeltic Ireland. 23 \n\nChurch historians have claimed nothing of real value was lost in \nthe destruction of pagan culture. Modern scholars disagree. The \nhavoc that afflicted art, science, literature, philosophy, engineering, \narchitecture, and all other fields of achievement has been likened to \nthe havoc of the Gigantomachia as if the crude giants overthrew the \nintelligent gods. The widespread literacy of the classical period \ndisappeared. Aqueducts, harbors, buildings, even the splendid Roman \nroads fell into ruin. It has been pointed out that centuries of \ndevastating war could hardly have shattered Roman civilization as \neffectively as did its new obsession with an ascetic monotheism. 24 \n\nBooks and artworks were destroyed because they expressed un- \nchristian ideas and images. 25 The study of medicine was forbidden, \non the ground that all diseases were caused by demons and could be \ncured only by exorcism. This theory was still extant in the time of \nPope Alexander III, who forbade monks to study any techniques of \nhealing other than verbal charms. 26 Under the Christian emperors, \neducated citizens were persecuted by the illiterate who claimed their \nbooks were witchcraft texts. Often, "magical" writings were planted \nby Christian magistrates for the sake of the financial rewards they \nreceived when they caught and executed heretics a system the \nInquisition also used to advantage in later centuries. Priestesses were \nespecially persecuted, because they were female, wealthy, and laid \nclaim to spiritual authority. 27 \n\nFathers of the church seemed cynically aware that public igno- \n\n210 \n\n\n\nranee worked in their favor. Gregory of Nazianzus wrote to St. Jerome: \n"A little jargon is all that is necessary to impose upon the people. The \nless they comprehend, the more they admire. Our forefathers and \ndoctors have often said, not what they thought, but what circumstances \nand necessity dictated." 28 \n\nLactantius declared that pagan temples should be torn down \nbecause, in them, "The demons are attempting to destroy the \nkingdom of God, and by means of false miracles and lying oracles are \nassuming the appearance of real gods." 29 It was dangerous to leave \nthe temples intact, even when they were converted into Christian \nchurches. The temple of the Mother of Heaven at Carthage was \nmade over into a church, but in 440 a.d. the bishop discovered that the \nCarthaginians were actually making their devotions to the old God- \ndess, and ordered the entire temple area leveled to the ground. 30 \n\nIgnorance was helpful to the spread of the faith; so ignorance \nwas fostered. Knight says, "Men are superstitious in proportion as they \nare ignorant, and . . . those who know least of the principles of \nreligion are the most earnest and fervent." 31 In keeping western Europe \nas ignorant as possible, however, the church lost much of its history. \nEven contemporary events went inaccurately reported, or altogether \nunnoted. Events of the past were absurdly garbled. All the public \nknew of history was provided by bards, who tried to maintain the druidic \ntradition of rote-learning, with indifferent success. They taught, for \nexample, that Alexander the Great made an expedition to the Garden \nof Eden, where he was instructed by the poet-magician Virgil, by \n"Monsignor St. Paul," and by "Tholomeus" (Ptolemy), king of Egypt. \nThey taught that Julius Caesar was a king of Hungary and Austria, \nand a prince of Constantinople; his mother was the Valkyrie Brunn- \nhilde, a daughter of Judas Maccabeus; he married Morgana, the \nFairy Queen, and became the father of Oberon and St. George. 32 \n\nThe field of natural science was in even worse disorder. Learned \nbooks taught that mice do not reproduce like other mammals but are \ngenerated spontaneously and asexually from "the putrefaction of the \nearth"; that wasps produce themselves out of a dead horse and bees \nout of a dead calf; that a crab deprived of its legs and buried will turn \ninto a scorpion; that some mammals, such as hares, can change from \none sex to the other; that a duck dried into powder and placed in water \nwill generate frogs; that a duck baked and buried will generate toads; \nthat asparagus is produced from buried shavings of ram\'s horn; that \nscorpions can be created from garden basil rubbed between two \nstones; that rain and lightning can be raised by burning a chameleon\'s \nliver on a rooftop; that no fleas can breed where a man scatters dust \ndug up from his right footprint in the place where he heard the first \nspringtime call of a cuckoo. 33 Because the very idea of experimenta- \ntion to test hypotheses had been replaced by credulous reliance on \ntheological authority, even notions that would have been simple to \ntest remained untested. \n\nAs for more complex hypotheses, they were beyond the ken of \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\n\n\n211 \n\n\n\nDavid, Saint theologians. Pagan thinkers long ago understood the shape of the \n\nearth, and even calculated its approximate circumference with only a \n\n^ ^^ m small error. But Lactantius and other learned churchmen called this \n\nfield of endeavor "bad and senseless," and proved by quoting the Bible \nthat the earth was flat. 34 \n\nThe most thoroughly Christianized nations hardly began to recov- \ner from the church\'s eclipse of learning until the present century. In \nSpain for example, the tradition of book-burning became an integral \npart of the auto-da-fe in 1 502. It was against the law for any layman \nto read any book not approved by the bishops. 35 To own vernacular \ncopies of either Testament of the Bible was punishable by burning at \nthe stake. 36 Reading declined to almost nothing. What few grammar \nschools existed were only "superficial preparation for the priesthood." \nStill, many priests were illiterate. General education was attempted only \nafter the revolutions of 1834 and 1855, when the monasteries were \nsuppressed. Yet in 18%, more than two-thirds of the population were \nstill unable to read or write. 37 \n\nSpanish suspicion of books carried over into the New World, and \ndeprived anthropologists and archeologists of literary treasures that \nmight have shed much light on pre-Columbian civilizations. Spanish \nfriars "converted" the Maya of Yucatan in 1 562, by their usual \nforceful methods, such as torture and burning. They fed the fires with \nhundreds of Maya sacred books which, had they survived, would \nhave greatly assisted modern scholars to unravel the mysteries of Mayan \nscript. The friars said the natives were "greatly afflicted" by the loss of \ntheir scriptures; but as far as the friars could see, these books "contained \nnothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the \ndevil, so we burned them all." 58 \n\n1.

He was the Welsh sea god worshipped as Dewi, from the \nAryan devior deva, "deity." Though he was called a 6th-century \nbishop, nothing was written of him until 1090, more than 500 years \nlater. His wholly unreliable biography was composed chiefly to \nsupport the Welsh bishops\' independence at the time. 1 \n\n\n\n212 \n\n\n\nThe city now called St. David\'s used to be Menevia, "Way of the Death \n\nMoon," the same as Danish Manavegr and Irish E-Mania, the lunar \nparadise. 2 ^^^^^^^^^^^_ \n\nSymbol of David-Dewi was the Great Red Serpent, now the red \ndragon, Wales\'s national emblem. Like the phallic god Python or \nOceanus encircling the World Egg, he may have been reddened by his \nunion with the Moon-goddess Mab, who gave sovereignty to all her \nkings by staining them red. 3 \n\nDavid\'s title, the Waterman, was explained by Christian scholars to \nmean he was a teetotaler. 4 Welsh sailors knew better; their traditions \nplaced him in the depths of the sea. They called him Davy Jones, who \nlike the sea god Mananann kept the souls of drowned seamen in his \n"locker." 5 \n\nWaterman was a popular title for several ancient gods of waters \nbesides Dewi: notably Ceadda, a Mercian god of medicinal springs, \nwho was canonized twice (see Chad). \n\nEven in Christian disguise, David retained the sacred skills of a \nbard. It was claimed that his miraculous talent for harping and singing \ncame from his lineal descent from the virgin Mary, of the ancient house \nof King David the Harpist, in the eighteenth generation. Mary was \nalso identified with the Welsh sea-goddess Marian, Dewi\'s bride, \nreceiver of the souls of the dead. Welsh bards called their death songs \nmarwysgafen, the "giving to Mary," sung to send the funeral boat to the \nIsles of the Dead. 6 \n\nSometimes David was confused with Merlin, who allegedly harped \nand sang the stones of Stonehenge into their places. Some legends \nmade David a bishop of Merlin\'s town, Caerleon. 7 Some said David \nwas King Arthur\'s uncle. Like many mythical saints, he was given a \nlong lifetime to demonstrate the health-giving virtues of Christian faith; \nhe lived to the age of 140 years. 8 His mother was the same virgin \ntemple-maiden who gave birth to nearly every ancient god; here she was \nSt. Non (Holy Nun). 9 Two cities claimed his shrine, located not only \nat St. David\'s but also in the city of Chester, which used to be named \nDeva or Dewi. 10 \n\n1.

Cumont, M.M., 57. \n\n\n\nIth \n\nbeen said that Death came into existence only with the rise of \nman\'s consciousness, a roundabout way of saying death is more real for \nhumans than for any other animal, because only humans foresee it. 1 \nReligions owe their existence to the unique ability of the human animal \nto understand that it must die. \n\nAgainst this realization the forces of imagination are mustered to \ndeny it. It\'s hard for any perceiving mind to perceive its own \n\n\n\n213 \n\n\n\nDeath notbeing, with cessation of all perception. Worshippers of Kali managed \n\nto view the beyond-death state as Dreamless Sleep. 2 But most ancient \n^^^^^^^^^^^ people couldn\'t formulate an idea of non-perception. \n\nEven when the land of the dead was minimally stimulating, as in \nthe Babylonian concept, it was perceptible to the senses. It was the \nHouse of Dust, and the end of the Road of No Return. The dead \nwere clothed in feathers, like birds. "Dust is their food and clay their \nmeat . . . , they see no light, they sit in darkness." Yet in the same \nHouse of Dust there were priests and kings ruling, and servants to carry \nthe baked meats and pour water from water skins. 3 \n\nBabylonian literature reveals a hope that eventually the right ritual \ncure for death will be discovered, rather as modern people hope for a \ncure for cancer. The recommended avenue of investigation was necro- \nmantic consultation with the dead themselves. "The quest for \nimmortality was essentially the search for the right ritual, the knowledge \nof what to do in order to secure a continued existence of the body \nafter death. This knowledge is possessed by the ancestors, and can only \nbe obtained from them." 4 \n\nMen have usually believed that knowledge of death can only come \nfrom those who have experienced it. Hence the initiatory procedures \ninvolving mock death, as among Siberian shamans, who experience in \ntrances being torn apart and reduced to bare bones. "By thus seeing \nhimself naked, altogether freed from the perishable and transient flesh \nand blood, he consecrates himself, in the sacred tongue of the \nshamans, to his great task, through that part of his body which will \nlongest withstand the action of the sun, wind and weather, after he is \ndead. . . . [I]n certain Central Asian meditations that are Buddhistic and \ntantric in origin or at least in structure, reduction to the skeleton \ncondition has . . . an ascetic and metaphysical value anticipating the \nwork of time, reducing life by thought to what it really is, an \nephemeral illusion in perpetual transformation." 5 \n\nSo vivid were the fantasies of the death-world that some Oriental \nsages prayed for sufficient conscious sense to realize that they were \nnothing more than inventions of the mind: "May I recognize whatever \nvisions appear, as the reflections of my own consciousness. May I \nknow them to be of the nature of apparitions in the intermediate State. \nMay I not fear the troops of my own thought forms, the Peaceful \n\nDeities and the Wrathful May it come that all the Sounds will be \n\nknown as one\'s own sounds; may it come that all the Radiances will . 1 \nbe known as one\'s own radiances." 6 \n\nTantric Buddhism proposed that the death world or Intermediate \nState could be controlled if one were prepared through carefully \nguided fantasy in life to retain memory, consciousness, and the goal of \nchoosing for one\'s self the right "womb-door" for a better reincarna- \ntion. 7 Living and dying were only complementary aspects of the same \ncycle, both requiring proper education. "Material life moves between \ntwo poles," Bachofen says. "Its realm is not that of being but that of \n\n\n\n214 \n\n\n\nbecoming and passing away, the eternal alternation of two colors, the \nLvhite of life and the black of death. Only through the equal mixture of \n!he two is the survival of the material world assured. Without death \nho rejuvenation is possible ... the positive power cannot for one mo- \nhtient exist without the negative power. Death, then, is not the \nbpposite but the helper of life." 8 \n\nThe Great Goddess was intimately involved in every manifestation \npf death as she was in those of life, which is why she had an \n[\'emanation" for each fatal disease, such as Mari-Amma, Ankamma, \nMutteyalamma, etc. Her priestesses supported and taught the dying. \n\'As among the gods, so among the mortals was death everywhere \nvoman\'s business. A woman is said to have invented the wailing for \nhe dead. . . . Women cradle the infant and the corpse, each to its \n^articular new life." 9 \n\nRomans thought death should be kept in mind at all times, \nspecially when life at its peak might make one forget the other, \nqually necessary part of the cycle. When a military hero entered Rome \nn triumphal procession, riding in a golden chariot, hailed as a god in \nhe ancient equivalent of a ticker-tape parade, a person wearing the \nnask and costume of Death stood at his shoulder, preserving him \nrom the sin of hubris by saying each moment in his ear, "Man, \nemember you will die." 10 \n\nPaganism fostered the Tantric idea of growth and decline in \necurrent cycles. "The old fertility gods did not shrink from the fact \n>f death; they sought no infantile evasion, but promised rebirth and \nenewal." u Christianity on the other hand denied that members of \nts sect could die. Early Christians who died were said to have "fallen \nsleep," soon to wake up again with the second coming of Christ. A \nnorbid anxiety often accompanied ritual denial. Kermode says, "Chris- \nianity of all the great religions is the most anxious, is the one which \naid the most emphasis on the terror of death." 12 \n\nSometimes fear became obsession, in a love-hate relationship with \neath. In the Secret Book of James, Jesus recommended suicide, \nmarking that the kingdom of death could only belong to those who \n>ut themselves to death, and no one who avoided this duty could be \naved. 13 \n\nObsession flowered into a thousand elaborate death customs and \nituals aimed at encapsulating the phenomenon, separating it from \nrdinary life experience so its inevitability need not be fully understood, \nn Frazer\'s opinion such customs and rituals have been the most \nwasteful ever seen in any society: \n\nNo belief has done so much to retard the economic and thereby the social \nprogress of mankind as has the belief in the immortality of the soul; for \nthis belief has led race after race, generation after generation, to sacrifice \nthe real wants of the living to the imaginary wants of the dead. The \nwaste and destruction of life and property which this faith has entailed are \nenormous and incalculable. \' 4 \n\n\n\nDeath \n\n\n\nSecret Book of \nJames One of the so- \ncalled Gnostic \nGospels discovered at \nNag Hammadi in \nUpper Egypt, 1945, \npurporting to have \nbeen written by the \napostle James. \n\n\n\n215 \n\n\n\nDeath Pagan philosophers\' acceptance of death may have been more \n\npractical than the elaborate denials that arose later. With a somber but \n\n^________ _ courageous serenity, Euripides stated the pagan idea that opinions on \n\ndeath are not possible: \n\nBut if any far-off state there be \n\nDearer to life than mortality \n\nThe hand of the Dark hath hold thereof, \n\nAnd mist is under the mist above; \n\nSo we are sick for life, and cling \n\nOn earth to this nameless and shining thing, \n\nFor other life is a fountain sealed, \n\nAnd the deeps below are unrevealed, \n\nAnd we drift on legends for ever. IS \n\nBecause they were westerners, the Greek philosophers have \nbeen given more credit for originality than they deserved. Actually, their \nopinions of death and its implications for the living were largely taken \nfrom Oriental sages who evolved them first. Greek notions of the \nDreamless Sleep, of reincarnation, of the four ages of man including \nthe primordial Age of Giants, all were derived from Oriental sources. \nTantric sages spoke of the faraway Golden Age when all men were \ngiants and lived lifetimes of about a thousand years each, because they \nwere nearer in time to the world\'s creation, when the Goddess\'s \nnourishing birth blood was more abundant and the knowledge of her \nwas more intimate among her children. As the Bible said, there were \ngiants in the earth in those days (Genesis 6:4). 16 \n\nThe same long-lived giants were identified with their own ances- \ntors by the authors of Genesis. The Hindu concept of human \nlongevity in the Golden Age was copied into the Bible as a quality of the \nearly patriarchs not quite a thousand years apiece, but at least more \nthan nine centuries. Adam lived to be 930 years old; Seth 912 years; \nEnos 905 years; and so on, the champion being Methusaleh at 969 \nyears (Genesis 5). \n\nHowever long delayed, though, death must come, and that was the \nthought that patriarchal thinkers found unacceptable. The older \nmatriarchal religions were more realistic in their acceptance of death, \nmaking it the sage\'s duty to realize the ugliness, corruption, and \ndecay in nature as fully as he might realize its beauty: to accord death \nthe same value as birth. The two were of equal importance, as two \npassages through the same Door: one coming out, the other going in. \nDifferent forms of the Goddess represented the idea. On the one \nhand she was the beautiful nubile Virgin or the tender nurturing \nMother; on the other hand she was a hideous ghoul, herself corpse- \nlike and a devourer of corpses and these two forms of her were to be \nadored equally. Avalon justly remarked that in the west, "the terrible \nbeauty of such forms is not understood"; missionaries could only \ndescribe the Death-goddess as a she-devil. 17 Yet, for the enlightened, \n\n\n\n216 \n\n\n\n"This fanged and bloody Goddess is the same as the other, the beautiful Deborah \n\n) mother and lover. To be able to superimpose and adore both images Delilah \n\n! in one is perhaps the solidest beginning on the road of sadhana." 18 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSome individuals in western culture arrived more or less indepen- \njdently at the vision of this archetypal female death spirit. Wherever \nthere was a concept of Mother Nature, it could hardly fail to be noticed \nthat it was natural to die, and the roots of every flower lay in organic \nrot. Coleridge spoke of the "Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH" as a \n(woman. Keats described himself as "half in love with easeful Death." \niLike the Oriental sages, Alfred de Vigny perceived Death as a maternal \n[Goddess: "O Death divine, at whose recall / Returneth all / To fade \nin thy embrace, / Gather thy children to thy bosom starred, / Free us \nfrom time, from number, and from space, / And give us back the rest \nthat life hath marred." 19 \n\nI. von Franz, pi. 7. 2.

Deborah lived under a sacred \nDalm tree that also bore her name, and was identified with the maternal \nTree of Life, like Xikum, the Tree of Ishtar. The Bible called her a \n\'prophetess" or "judge" to disguise the fact that she was one of the \ngoverning matriarchs of a former age (Judges 4:4). \n\nOne of Deborah\'s alternate names was Jael, "the Goddess Jah," \nwssibly the same one patriarchal Persians called Jahi the Whore, an \narlier feminine form of Yahweh. 2 \n\n1. Sobol, 138; Neumann, CM., 267. 2. Albright, 23. \n\n\n\nDelilah \n\n\'She Who Makes Weak," a name compounded of De (daleth), the \n\'onic Door, and lilu, the lotus, another yonic symbol. She was the \nGoddess who "weakened" the sun god every day and sent him to his \nleath on the wheel that turned him under the earth. In the case of \n>amson who was the sun god Shams-On, or Shamash it was the \nnill wheel. In the case of Heracles, another name for the same solar \nleity, it was Omphale\'s wheel: the omphalos often represented by the \nosmic yoni. \n\n\n\n217 \n\n\n\nDelphi Delphi \n\nDemeter \n\n\n\n"Womb"; Greece\'s oldest, most famous oracle, where Mother Earth \nwas worshipped under the name of Delphyne, the Womb of Creation, \nalong with her serpent-son and consort Python. 1 At various times the \noracle was said to belong to the Sea-goddess, or the Moon-goddess, \nvarious designations of the same primal Mother, whose priestess- \ndaughters, the Pythonesses, controlled the rites. Eventually the \npatriarchal god Apollo took it over, retaining the Pythonesses, but \nclaiming to have placed the Serpent in his underground uterine cave, \nwhence came the oracle\'s inspiration. Apollo murdered the priestess \nDelphyne, and held the oracle until it was closed by the Christian \nemperor Theodosius. After him, Arcadius had the temple entirely \ndestroyed. \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,80. \n\n\n\nDemeter \n\nGreek meter is "mother." De is the delta, or triangle, a female- \ngenital sign known as "the letter of the vulva" in the Greek sacred \nalphabet, as in India it was the Yoni Yantra, or yantra of the vulva. 1 \nCorresponding letters Sanskrit dwr, Celtic duir, Hebrew daleth \nmeant the Door of birth, death, or the sexual paradise. 2 Thus, \nDemeter was what Asia called "the Doorway of the Mysterious Femi- \nnine ... the root from which Heaven and Earth sprang." ? In \nMycenae, one of Demeter\'s earliest cult centers, tholos tombs with their \ntriangular doorways, short vaginal passages and round domes, repre- \nsented the womb of the Goddess from which rebirth might come. \nDoorways generally were sacred to women. In Sumeria they were \npainted red, representing the female "blood of life." 4 In Egypt, door- \nways were smeared with real blood for religious ceremonies, a custom \ncopied by the Jews for their Passover rites. \n\nThe triangle-door-yoni symbolized Demeter\'s trinity. Like all the \noldest forms of the basic Asiatic Goddess she appeared as Virgin, \nMother, and Crone, or Creator, Preserver, Destroyer, like Kali-Cunti \nwho was the same yoni-mother. Demeter\'s Virgin form was Kore, \nthe Maiden, sometimes called her "daughter," as in the classical myth \nof the abduction of Kore, which divided the two aspects of the \nGoddess into two separate individuals. Demeter\'s Mother form had \nmany names and titles, such as Despoena, "the Mistress"; Daeira, \n"the Goddess"; the Barley-Mother; the Wise One of Earth and Sea; or \nPluto, "Abundance." This last name was transferred to the male \nunderworld god said to have taken the Maiden into the earth-womb \nduring the dark season when fields lay fallow. But this was a late, \nartificial myth. The original Pluto was female, and her "riches" were \npoured out on the world from her breasts. 5 \n\nThe Crone phase of Demeter, Persephone-the-Destroyer, was \n\n\n\n218 \n\n\n\nidentified with the Virgin in late myth, so the Maiden abducted into \nthe underworld was sometimes Kore, sometimes Persephone. Some of \nthe Destroyer\'s other, earlier names were Melaina, the Black One; \nDemeter Chthonia, the Subterranean One; or The Avenger (Erinys). \nHer black-robed, mare-headed idol, her mane entwined with Gorgon \nsnakes, appeared in one of her oldest cave-shrines, Mavrospelya, the \nBlack Cave, in Phigalia (southwest Arcadia). She carried a dolphin \nI and a dove, symbols of womb and yoni. Like the devouring death- \ngoddess everywhere, she was once a cannibal. She ate the flesh of \nPelops, then restored him to life in her cauldron. 6 She was as fearsome \nas every other version of the Crone. The legendary medieval Night- \nMare an equine Fury who tormented sinners in their sleep was \nbased on ancient images of Mare-headed Demeter. \n\nHer cult was already well established at Mycenae in the 1 3th \ncentury B.C. and continued throughout Greece well into the Chris- \ntian era, a length of time almost equal to the lifespan of Christianity \nitself. 7 Her temple at Eleusis, one of the greatest shrines in Greece, \nbecame the center of an elaborate mystery-religion. Sophocles wrote, \n"Thrice happy they of men who looked upon these rites ere they go \nto Hades\'s house; for they alone there have true life." Aristides said, \n"The benefit of the festival is not merely the cheerfulness of the \nmoment and the freedom and respite from all previous troubles, but also \nthe possession of happier hopes concerning the end, hopes that our \nlife hereafter will be the better, and that we shall not lie in darkness and \nfilth the fate that is believed to await the uninitiated." Isocrates said: \n"Demeter . . . being graciously minded towards our forefathers because \nof their services to her, services of which none but the initiated may \nhear, gave us the greatest of all gifts, first, those fruits of the earth which \nsaved us from living the life of beasts, and secondly, that rite which \nmakes happier the hopes of those that participate therein concerning \nboth the end of life and their whole existence." 8 \n\nEleusis meant "advent." Its principal rites brought about the \nadvent of the Divine Child or Savior, variously named Brimus, \nDionysus, Triptolemus, Iasion, or Eleuthereos, the Liberator. Like the \ncorn, he was born of Demeter-the-earth and laid in a manger or \nwinnowing basket. 9 His flesh was eaten by communicants in the form of \nbread, made from the first or last sheaves. His blood was drunk in the \nform of wine. Like Jesus, he entered the Earth and rose again. \nCommunicants were supposed to partake of his immortality, and \nafter death they were known as Demetreioi, blessed ones belonging to \nDemeter. 10 \n\nRevelations were imparted to the initiate through secret "things \nheard, things tasted, and things seen." " This formula immediately \ncalls to mind the three admonitory monkeys covering ears, mouth, and \neyes, supposed to illustrate the maxim, "Hear no evil, speak no evil, \nsee no evil." Was the "evil" a secret descended from Eleusinian \nreligion? Demeter was worshipped as "the Goddess" by Greek \n\n\n\nDemeter \n\n\n\n219 \n\n\n\nDemetra, Saint peasants all the way through the Middle Ages, even up to the 19th \n\ncentury at Eleusis where she was entitled "Mistress of Earth and \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Sea." In 1801 two Englishmen named Clarke and Cripps caused a riot \namong the peasants by taking the Goddess\'s image away to a \nmuseum in Cambridge. 12 \n\nEarly Christians were much opposed to the Eleusinian rites \nbecause of their overt sexuality, even though their goal was "regener- \nation and forgiveness of sins." 13 Asterius said, "Is not Eleusis the scene \nof descent into the darkness, and of the solemn acts of intercourse \nbetween the hierophant and the priestess, alone together? Are not the \ntorches extinguished, and does not the large, the numberless assem- \nbly of common people believe that their salvation lies in that which is \nbeing done by the two in the darkness?" H Fanatic monks destroyed \nthe temple of these sexual mysteries in 396 a.d., but the site remained \nholy to the Goddess\'s votaries, and the ceremonies were carried on \nthere and elsewhere. 15 \n\nRustics never ceased believing that Demeter\'s spirit was manifest \nin the final sheaf of the harvest, often called the Demeter, the Corn \nMother, the Old Woman, etc. At harvest festivals it was often dressed in \nwoman\'s clothing and laid in a manger to make the cattle thrive. 16 \nSecret anti-Christian doctrines of medieval Freemasonry also drew \nsome symbolism from the cults of the ancient Mistress of Earth and \nSea, particularly the masonic sacred image of Plenty: "an ear of corn \nnear a fall of water." 17 The ultimate Mystery was revealed at Eleusis \nin "an ear of corn reaped in silence" a sacred fetish that the Jews \ncalled shibboleth. 18 \n\n1.

The saint\'s daughter \n(Kore) was kidnapped by "a wicked Turkish wizard" (Hades) and \nlocked up in a tower. A young hero rescued her, but perished \nmiserably, chopped in pieces by the wizard and hung from the tower\'s \nwalls "between heaven and earth." Guided by a stork (her ancient \ntotemic bird of birth), St. Demetra arrived on the scene, reassembled \n\n\n\n220 \n\n\n\nthe hero, and brought him back to life. Several elements of this story Demon \n\nwere repeated in the Germanic fairy tale of Rapunzel. \n\nA masculinized version of Demeter or perhaps one of her \n\nDemetreioi was accepted into the canon as a "St. Demetrius," of \nno known date, and no real biography. His legend, established in the \nlate Middle Ages, made him a warrior saint like the equally mythical \nSt. George. The basic story was invented to publicize his healing relics \npreserved at Salonika. 2 \n\n1. Lawson, 80-84. 2. Attwater, 102. \n\n\n\nDemon \n\nFrom Greek daimon, a personal familiar spirit or guardian angel, like \nthe Roman genius, roughly synonymous with "soul." The daimon of a \nhero could undergo apotheosis, become a god, and rise to heaven to \ndwell among the stars. \n\nThe medieval concept of the demon evolved from Christians\' \nblanket condemnation of all pagan daimones, though they continued \nto believe implicitly in their existence. 1 Demons were usually consid- \nered messengers and assistants of a single Devil, in the same \nrelationship to him as angels to God. Yet they were also called "devils" \nand their master could be "the Demon." The terms were never \nclearly distinguished. \n\nAnimals and people could be "demons," or could harbor demons \nwithin their bodies or minds. Sometimes, any alien group of people \ncould be called demons. Europeans often visualized demons as black, \nlike Negroes. 2 On the other hand, dark-skinned people like the \nSinghalese maintained that demons were white and hairy.* \n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, all bad weather and natural \ncatastrophes were brought about by demons. He said, "It is a dogma \nof faith that demons can produce wind, storms, and rain of fire from \nheaven." Pope Eugene IV issued a bull against human "agents of \nSatan" who controlled weather-demons. Pope John XXII complained \nof wizards who tried to kill him through the agency of demons they \nsent into mirrors and rings. 4 \n\nThe church had several mutually contradictory theories about the \norigin of demons. One theory said they were the rebellious angels \nwho fell with Lucifer, before the creation of Adam and Eve, so the \nprinciple of evil was ready in the garden of Eden to play the tempter\'s \nrole. A second, incompatible theory said demons were created after \nhuman beings. They were begotten by the angels on the daughters of \nmen (Genesis 6:4). "The majority opinion about the fall of the angels, \nheld by St. Augustine and therefore accepted in the Middle Ages, \nwas that it had occurred before the creation of Adam, but some of the \nold notion that the angels had fallen through lust for the daughters of \nmen persisted to reinforce antifeminine prejudices." 5 \n\n\n\n221 \n\n\n\nDemon Some authorities, familiar with the pagans\' animal masks and \n\nanimal-headed idols, said demons were an animal-like race created \n^^^^^^^^^^^ separately by God, ahd readily incarnate in animal form. Black goats, \nbulls, cats, or dogs could be demons. The Gaelic uile-bheist (Yule- \nbeast, moon-calf) was called a demonic animal. St. Ambrose told of a \ncertain priest who exorcised the frogs in a certain marsh to stop them \nfrom croaking during mass. A thirteenth-century bishop of Lausanne \nexorcised all the eels in Lake Leman. 6 St. Augustine confidently \nasserted that demons help sorcerers to perform their magic, and have \nthe power to assume many animal shapes. 7 \n\nAt Basel in 1474, a rooster committed the unnatural crime of \nlaying an egg. It was decided that the bird possessed a demon, but \nexorcism failed to remove it. So the unfortunate rooster was solemnly \nsentenced to death by church authorities, and burned at the stake. 8 \n\nGreeks still believe in the half-horse demons, kallikantzari, de- \nscended from ancient centaurs and the shape-shifting horse-wizards \nof India, the kinnaras, "canterers" who used to live on the holy \nmoilntain of Mandara. 9 Their descendants perhaps founded the city \nof Kallipolis (Gallipoli). Their chief is still called the Lame Devil, \nrecalling lame Amazonian smith-gods like Hephaestus. Until recently \nit was thought any child born on Christmas Day would become a \nkalhkantzaros. w A cruel custom arose from this belief. Children born \non Christmas Day were carried to the market square, where their feet \nwere thrust into a fire until the toenails were singed. 11 The magical \npurpose of this may have been to destroy the horse-demons\' "hoofs." \n\nRecords of witch trials show that almost any kind of animal could \nbe perceived as a demon. Witches were executed because a neigh- \nbor\'s child was frightened by "the devil in the shape of a dog"; or \nbecause a man saw "a Thing like unto a rat" run out of a woman\'s \nhouse; or because a woman kept "two devils in the form of colts"; or be- \ncause a neighbor saw "the devil in the form of a toad" in a woman\'s \ngarden; or because a traveler saw "a Thing like a black cow" near the \nhouse of the accused; or because children heard a woman "talk to the \ndevil in the form of a frog." One woman was condemned because \nneighbors heard near her house at night a "foul yelling, like a number \nof cats." No one seems to have suggested that the yelling was in fact \ndone by cats, not demons. \n\nUrsula Kemp was hanged in 1 581 on the evidence of her own 8- \nyear-old son, who testified that she kept four demons: two cats, a \ntoad, and a black lamb. 12 Not once in the recorded trials did authorities \nquestion witnesses\' ability to distinguish these demons from ordinary \nanimals. It was taken for granted that anyone, even a small child, could \nrecognize His Satanic Majesty no matter how cleverly he disguised \nhimself as an apparently normal beast. \n\nSeveral popes were believed to have familiar demons of their own, \nparticularly the famous Honorius, long remembered as a magician. \nDuring the controversy between Pope Boniface VIII and Philip IV of \n\n\n\n222 \n\n\n\nFrance, the king held an assembly that formally deposed the pope Demon \n\nand presented evidence to prove that he was a sorcerer with a familiar \n\nspirit. 13 ^^_ ^_^____ \n\nSometimes, in the description of demons, imagination failed and \nhad to fall back on popular make-believe. One poor wretch named \nMargot de la Barre was burned at Paris in 1 391 for calling up a demon \n"in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." Pressed \nto describe the demon under the stimulus of torture she could think \nof nothing better to say than that he had "the shape that demons take \nin Passion plays." 14 \n\nIt was often assumed that demons congregated especially in and \naround churches, for some inexplicable reason. Churches had to be \nexorcised at their dedication. Crosses were painted on the walls "to \nterrify the demons." 1S \n\nHouses were similarly protected by many crosses and crucifixes \nbut, nevertheless, harbored many demons, a belief that betrayed little \ntrust in the alleged powers of the crucifix. The custom of ringing church \nbells at the time of a death was supposed to drive away demons "who \nstood at the bed\'s foot, and about the house, ready to seize their prey, or \nat least to molest and terrify the soul in its passage, but by the ringing \nof that bell (for Durandus informs us evil spirits are much afraid of \nbells), they were kept aloof: and the soul, like a hunted hare, gained \nthe start." Tolling the church\'s largest bell commanded a higher price, \n"for that, being louder, the evil spirits must go farther off, to be clear \nof its sound, by which the poor Soul got so much more the start of \nthem." 16 \n\nBefore the witchcraft mania set in about the 12th and 1 3th \ncenturies, there was a general understanding that demons were \nnothing more than the old gods and goddesses, all of whom had animal \nincarnations of some kind. Christian fathers insisted that the pagan \ndeities were not figments of imagination, but real, living demons. \nLearned men even in the 19th century still believed this. Rawlinson, \nthe translator of Herodotus, was sure the oracle at Delphi was an evil \nspirit. 17 An early medieval baptismal formula demanded renunciation \nof "relations with the demon," defining the old religion as "works of the \ndemon, and all his words, and Thor, and Odin, and Saxnot, and all \nevil beings that are like them." 18 Such formalities were largely ignored. \nCenturies later, holiday dancers included personifications of the \nHorned God and the Scandinavian Julebuk (Yule Buck), which church- \nmen denounced as "the devil himself." 19 Monastic writers of the \n1 1th century spoke of many demons who constantly tempted people \naway from the church, showing them "delights and secrets, such as \nhow they might become immortal." 20 It was clear that they spoke of a \nrival religion. \n\nA Spanish Dominican, Raymond of Tarrega, said demons were \nuseful for punishing sinners in hell; like angels, demons performed \nGod\'s will.

Krishna\'s virgin mother was her "maiden" form, \nDevaki. The Goddess\'s title as "the Way leading to the Gods" was \nDevayani, the Divine Yoni. As the virgin mother of Mahavira she \nwas Devananda, "Blessed Goddess." \' A Czech name for the Moon- \ngoddess, Devana, came from the same root, as also the Latin Diana, \n\n\n\n224 \n\n\n\ni% \n\n\n\nMinoan Diwija, Serbian Diiwica, and the Roman Diviana all mean- \ning "The Divinity." 2 \n\nI. Larousse, 347. 2. Thorsten, 361. \n\n\n\nDevil \n\n\n\nDevil \n\nThe words "devil" and "divinity" grew from the same root, Indo- \nEuropean devi (Goddess) or deva (God), which became daeva (devil) in \nPersian. 1 Old English divell (devil) can be traced to the Roman \nderivative divus, divi: gods. 2 Thus it seems that, from the beginning, \ngods and devils were often confused with one another. \n\nDivine and devilish were relative terms, as the primary sense of \nHebrew words for "good" and "evil" really meant "beneficial" and \n"hurtful." 3 Gods did "evil" things if angered; devils could do "good" \nthings if they were pleased. One man\'s god was his enemy\'s devil. \nArmenians used to sacrifice one sheep to Christ at Easter time and thirty \nsheep to the devil, on the theory that the devil\'s influence in the here \nand now was greater. 4 \n\nSuch thinking was not unusual. Devils were often credited with \nbeneficent magic. There was a devil who "maketh men witty, turneth \nall metals into the coin of the dominion, turneth water into wine, and \nwine into water, and blood into wine, and wine into blood, and a \nfool into a wise man and he leads 33 legions of demons." Another \ndevil "perfectly teaches the virtues of the stars, he transformeth men, \nhe giveth dignities, prelacies, and confirmations." Another devil "talketh \nof divine virtue, he giveth true answers of things present, past, and to \ncome, and of the divinity, and of the creation, he deceiveth none, nor \nsuffereth any to be tempted; he giveth dignities and prelacies." 5 \n\nEven early Christians admitted that the "devils" worshipped in \npagan temples were known to restore the sick to health. 6 Tertullian \nsaid, Diabolus simia Dei, the Devil imitates God; but in point of \nchronology there was some doubt about who was imitating whom. 7 \n\nJudeo-Christian tradition attributed many "diabolic" acts to God. \nHe was the sender of pestilence and famine. He created a terrible \nhell, and its demons, who tortured human souls on his orders. He \ncaused violent storms, which were (and still are) called "acts of God." \nFrom the 1 5 th century on, the church sold waxen cakes, the Agnus \nDei, stamped with a cross and advertised as sure protection against \nstorms and other "acts of God"; thus God was incongruously invoked to \ncombat himself. 8 \n\nGod even killed himself in the person of Christ, according to the \npieological dogma that they were one and the same. On the other \nBiand, some claimed Christ was killed by "devilish" Jews. Though Jews \n(were carrying out God\'s ordained scheme of salvation, and doing \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens \nTertullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Carthage \nof pagan parents. \n\n\n\n225 \n\n\n\nDevil God\'s will by executing Jesus, nevertheless theology exonerated God \n\nand blamed them. Though the Old Testament God did much "evil," \n^^^^^^^^^^ even destroying many thousands of his own helpless worshippers for \ntrivial offenses (1 Samuel 6:19), yet churchmen seldom dared to \naccept the Bible\'s own presentation of God as the maker of evil: "I form \nthe light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I the \nLord do all these things" (Isaiah 45:7). On the basis of this scripture, \nsome advanced the theory that God had deliberately created the devil \nbefore the beginning of the world, because a pre-existing evil principle \nwas necessary to "test the faith" of the future human race. 9 Yet \nsomehow, to make a devil was not evil if God did it. \n\nThe Persians believed God and the devil were twin brothers, born \nsimultaneously from the womb of the dualistic mother of Infinite \nTime, Zurvan. The devil (Ahriman) was cast down from heaven to the \nunderworld only because his sacrifice, like Cain\'s, was not acceptable \nto the older deity. The heavenly god (Ahura Mazda) continued to reign \nin the heights because he knew how to make the right sacrifices. \n\nBut the devil, not the god, was the true creator of the earth and all \ncreatures in the mundane world of matter. Thus the Magi prayed to \nhim for assistance in all worldly endeavors, and revered him as the \nsource of their magic powers. Ahriman was worshipped in Roman \ntimes throughout northern Europe, identified with all chthonian gods \nlike Pluto, Saturn, or Dis Pater. 10 In early Christian mystery-plays he \nappeared as a wonder-working spirit, one Saint Mahown. 11 \n\nThe Christian devil became a composite of ancient deities in a \nsingle Protean form. He had the goat-horns and hoofs of satyr-gods \nlike Pan, Marsyas, and Dionysus; the trident of Neptune, Hades, or \nShiva; the reptilian form of Leviathan, Python, or Ouroborus; the \nfiery form of Agni or Helios; the female breasts of Astarte-Ishtar; the \nwolf face of Dis, Feronius, or Fenrir; the quadruple wings of \nBabylonian cherubim; the bird claws of ancestral spirits, the aves; and all \nthe god-names Christians had ever heard, including many secret \nnames of their own God: Jupiter, Mercury, Minerva, Venus, Hades, \nPluto, Baal-Zebub, Lucifer, Zeus Chthonios, Sabazius, Belial, Ado- \nnis, Sabaoth, Iao, Soter, Emmanuel, Sammael. 12 The devil could take \nany shape, even a human one: Pope Gregory IX described him as "a \npale, black-eyed youth with a melancholy aspect." 1? At other times he \nwas an animal composite, as on the Amulet of Bes: \n\nNaked genius with the head of Bes, flanked by seven heads of animals \namong whom are bull, lion, and ibis, and surmounted by atef crown \nwith several horns; four wings; falcon-tail and crocodile-tail; four arms \ntwo arms stretched out along the wings hold lances and serpents, while \nthe third on the left seizes a lion, the fourth on the right holds sceptre and I \nwhip. The erect penis ends in a lionhead; there are lionmasks on the \nknees, the feet are given the form of jackal-heads with pointed ears and \nprolonged as coiled snakes. Bes stands on an ouroboros (cosmic \nserpent) which contains various animals: scorpion, crocodile, tortoise. M I \n\n\n\n226 \n\n\n\nThe devil\'s popular nickname Old Scratch came from a Germanic Devil \n\nwood-spirit called a Scrat or Waldscrat, sometimes a protector of \n\nhouseholds known as Schraetlin or "little Scrat." The spirit inhabited \n\na phallic amulet based on the bisexual lingam-yoni, as suggested by \nAnglo-Saxon scritta, Old English scrat, a hermaphrodite. Another \nnickname of the devil, Deuce, came from Gaulish gods called Dusii, a \nvariation oldeus, "god." Again there was a hermaphroditic connota- \ntion, since "deuce" also meant "two." 15 \n\nSome demonologists postulated seven devils, one for each of the \nseven deadly sins: Lucifer (pride), Mammon (avarice), Asmodeus \n(lechery), Satan (anger), Beelzebub (gluttony), Leviathan (envy) and \nBelphegor (sloth). Belial, a slightly less prestigious spirit, governed \nsuch "vessels of iniquity" as playing cards and dice. 16 \n\n"Devils" and "the devil" were interchangeable. The devil was \none, and also many: a monotheistic transformation of a polytheistic \nconcept. Christian nations asserted that all other nations worshipped \n"devils" or "the devil" under many names. A 16th-century list of \ndevil-worshipping countries included: Tartary, China, Lapland, Fin- \nland, the Northern Islands, the East Indies, Persia, Arabia, Anatolia, \nEgypt, Ethiopia, Turkey, Russia, and Norway. 17 According to the 18th- \ncentury German theologian Johann Beaumont, any person anywhere \nin the world who "confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh" \nbelongs to the devils. 18 \n\nAs God incarnated himself in earthly flesh, so the devil was \nsupposed to incarnate himself in earthly flesh shortly before the \ncoming of doomsday. This demonic being was usually called Antichrist. \nHe would be known by his Christlike ability to perform healing \nmiracles, such as restoring sight to the blind. 19 It was never explained \nhow these demonic miracles were to be distinguished from holy ones. \nThe coming of Antichrist was constantly announced, dozens of times in \nj each century. Canon Moreau and contemporary churchmen report- \ned that Antichrist was born in 1 599 at Babylon, where the Jews \nacclaimed him as their Messiah. 20 Apparently he was identified with \nthe Messianic Elijah for whom the Jews looked each year at Passover. \n\nIf there were any devilish attributes on which most myths agreed, \nthey were the rather godlike qualities of (1) superhuman intelligence, \nand (2) superhuman sexuality. Inquisitor Jean Bodin wrote, "It is \ncertain that the devils have a profound knowledge of all things. No \ntheologian can interpret the Holy Scriptures better than they can; no \nlawyer has more detailed knowledge of testaments, contracts and \nactions; no physician or philosopher can better understand the composi- \ntion of the human body, and the virtues of the heavens, the stars, \nbirds and fishes, trees and herbs, metals and stones." Inquisitor Nicholas \nRemy said the devil had complete knowledge of everything human \nbeings could not explain. "Everything which is unknown lies ... in the \ncursed domain of demonology; for there are no unexplained facts. \nWhatever is not normal is due to the Devil." 21 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n227 \n\n\n\nDevil No Christian was permitted to disbelieve in the devil. His credibility \n\nrested on the same foundation as that of God. Indeed, the very \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m concept of salvation depended on the devil. If there had been no \nTempter, there was no original sin, no fall, no hell, no need of a \nredeemer or a church. De Givry correctly said, "If the Satanic concept \nis tampered with, the whole edifice laboriously erected by the Fathers \nof the Church crumbles to the ground." 22 \n\nThe devil was essential to the dualistic theology that Christianity \ncopied from Persia. If the world was divided between the forces of \ngood and evil, an evil deity was necessary, otherwise evil would have to \nbe blamed on God. Logically, a god couldn\'t be both all-good and all- \npowerful. If God could make a world without evil, and would not, he \ncouldn\'t be all-good. If God wanted to make a world without evil, \nand could not, he couldn\'t be all-powerful. The only solution not a \ngood one, but the only possible one was to supply God with an \nevenly matched adversary, to be responsible for evil. Thus theologians \nthought it the worst heresy, "contrary to the true faith," to suggest \nthat devils existed only in the ignorant imagination. 23 The devil was so \nreal to Martin Luther that he accosted him one evening and threw an \ninkpot at him. 24 \n\nIt was a severe theological problem to account for God\'s apparent \nhelplessness to halt the devil\'s activity. Though Lucifer or Satan was \nsupposed to have been utterly defeated and immobilized during the \nfamous War in Heaven, yet he was so lively that the War seemed to \nhave caused him nothing more than a momentary inconvenience. \nTheologians could only propose that God "permitted" the devil\'s \nfreedom of action. They said, "It is not the witch\'s ointment nor her \nincantation that makes her forked stick fly through the air, but the \npower of the devil, allowed by God." 25 They never explained why the \nchurch punished what God allowed. \n\nMuch semantic hairsplitting went into defining relationships be- \ntween the devil, God, and humanity, such as the distinction between \nsorcery and witchcraft. Sorcery was evoking spirits to "carry out those \npowers which God permitted the Devil." Witchcraft was evoking \nspirits to "commit acts against His ruling." In practice, a man who asked \nthe devil to help him seduce a woman was not guilty of any crime, \nbecause sex was under the devil\'s jurisdiction, by God\'s order. Devils \nwho killed children did nothing sinful, for God permitted them to kill \nchildren "in order to punish their parents." 26 On the other hand, a \nwoman who tried to save her dying child with witch-herbs was \nmortally guilty and deserved the death penalty. 27 \n\nTheologians argued that all works of witches were brought about \nby the devil with God\'s permission. Even a witch who did only good \nworks, like healing the sick, must suffer the same death as a witch whose \nacts were harmful. 28 Thus witches were placed in a no-win situation. \nOnce a man beat a witch for casting a spell on his son, and forced her to \nremove the spell. Pope Benedict XIV ruled that the witch committed \n\n\n\n228 \n\n\n\na double sin by using the devil\'s power twice, even though she did it \nunder coercion the second time. Benedict carefully stipulated that the \nman who beat her was entirely innocent of wrongdoing. 29 \n\nThe church created the idea that witches were the devil\'s helpers, \ninvolved in a vast plot to undermine Christian society. This theory \nwas the real root of the witch mania. The people were generally \nindifferent to the priests\' witch-hunting until this theory was forced \non them by propaganda from the pulpit, which deliberately played on \ntheir fear of the devil after stimulating it in the first place. 50 \n\nIt sometimes happened that churchmen themselves consulted the \ndevil, without paying the same penalties they inflicted on lay persons. \nSome miracle-working heretics were convicted by the bishop of Besan- \ncon in 1 1 70, on the evidence of none other than Satan, interviewed \nby the bishop with the help of a priest skilled in necromancy. Satan \nassured the bishop that the accused were indeed his servants, so they \nwere sent to the stake. 31 \n\nThe devil was useful to clergymen or anyone else seeking an \nexcuse for lecherous behavior. According to one story: \n\nThe devil transformed himself into the appearance of St. Silvanus, Bishop \nof Nazareth, a friend of St. Jerome. And this devil approached a noble \nwoman by night in her bed and began first to provoke and entice her with \nlewd words, and then invited her to perform the sinful act. And when \nshe called out, the devil in the form of the saintly Bishop hid under the \nwoman \'s bed, and being sought for and found there, he in lickerish \nlanguage declared lyingly that he was Bishop Silvanus. On the morrow \ntherefore, when the devil had disappeared, the holy man was scandal- \nously defamed. 32 \n\nSome sly fellows used the devil to defraud. There was a \nCornishman who convinced his neighbors that he had sold his soul to \nthe devil. Taking a few coins to the tavern each night, he pretended \nto receive money from the devil to pay for his drink. He would thrust his \nhat up the chimney, calling on his diabolic friend; and the coins \nappeared in his hat. The superstitious innkeeper wouldn\'t touch the \ndevil\'s money, so the Cornishman drank all evening for free. 35 \n\nThe devilish pact was not a joke, however; it was an essential \ningredient of the devil-mythology that killed millions during six \ncenturies of witch-hunting. Yet it was logically absurd. If the devil \nreceived the soul of every sinner, as the church taught, he had no \nneed to secure it with a "pact"; it would be his anyway. As for the \nsinners themselves, they seemed to derive little benefit from their side \nof the contract, as Scot pointed out: any woman in her right mind would \nreject the devil\'s bargain, saying, "Why should I hearken to you, \nwhen you will deceive me? Did you not promise my neighbor Mother \nDutton to save and rescue her; and yet lo she is hanged?" 34 \n\nEarly in the Christian era there were no very severe punishments \nfor making a pact with the devil. The Golden Legend tells of a young \nman who signed over his soul to the devil to win the love of a certain \n\n\n\nDevil \n\n\n\n\n\n\n229 \n\n\n\nDevil lady. Later, St. Basil prayed over the young man and retrieved his \n\ncontract, a piece of paper which dropped from an upper balcony of the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ church, "fluttered down through the air and fell into his hands, in the \nsight of all." The paper was torn up and the youth set free. 55 \n\nSeveral popes were said to have made a diabolic pact, including \none who may have ideological roots in a genuine pagan tradition: \nSilvester II. His real name was Gerbert de Aurillac. He grew up in a \nFrance still permeated by Dianic and druidic fairy-religion, where \nAphrodite was worshipped at Rouen up to the 12th century, and the \nMoon-goddess\'s groves attracted pilgrims up to the 14th. Silvester \nchose a papal name meaning "spirit of the grove," and it was said he \nhad a fairy mistress named Meridiana (Mary-Diana), who taught him \nthe secrets of magic. 36 According to Cardinal Benno and William of \nMalmesbury, Silvester signed a pact with the devil to achieve the \npapal throne, and the devil gave it to him. 37 \n\nThe truth about Pope Silvester was that he had unusually intellec- \ntual tastes for his time. He remarked that, for the frustrations and \ndifficulties of his life, "philosophy was the only cure." 38 In his time, \n"philosophy" didn\'t mean Christian theology. It meant pagan litera- \nture, natural science, and Hermetism. \n\nThe list of great wen in those centuries charged with magic . . . is \nastounding; it includes every man of real mark, and in the midst of \nthem stands one of the most thoughtful popes, Silvester II (Gerbert), and \nthe foremost of medieval thinkers on natural science, Albert the Great. \nIt came to be the accepted idea that, as soon as a man conceived a wish to \nstudy the works of God, his first step must be a league with the devil. 39 \n\nAnother "devilish" philosopher was Heinrich Cornelius Agrip- \npa von Nettesheim, historiographer to Emperor Charles V, author of \nthe famous treatise on Hermetism, De occulta philosophia. The \nchurch execrated his works and severely reprimanded him for trying to \ndefend accused witches, but his wealthy patrons protected him from \narrest: only once he was imprisoned for debt, not heresy. 40 He called \nmagic the perfect science, and implied as the Gnostic heretics did \nthat knowledge came to man not as a gift of God but as a gift of the \ndevil. \n\nAgrippa\'s life story contributed to the legend of Faust, around \nwhich centered many thrilling tales of the devil\'s pact. The real Faust \nwas not impressive. As an obscure schoolmaster in Kreuznach, he was \ndismissed from his post in 1 507 on a charge of sodomy. 41 Six years \nlater he reappeared as an astrologer and soothsayer calling himself the \nDemigod of Heidelberg. Later, citizens of Munster knew him as "the \nfamous necromancer, Dr. Faustus." Ultimately, his fame rested not on \nany of his doings but on the so-called Faustian books, Hb\'llenzwange, \n"Harrowings of Hell," which he didn\'t write. These anonymous works \ngrew into a large body of literature professing to tell the reader how to \nmake a pact with the devil, work magic, find buried treasure, win love \nand fortune, and finally renounce the pact in time to save one\'s soul. \n\n\n\n230 \n\n\n\nPredictably, such books were enormously popular. Two books really \nwritten by Agrippa von Nettesheim to win the favor of Margaret of \nAustria, The Superiority of Women and The Nobility of the Female \nSex, were declared heretical and forbidden publication by the clergy. 42 \n\nMagic books nearly always gave formulae for negotiating with the \ndevil. Le Dragon Rouge told the aspiring wizard to address "Emper- \nor Lucifer, master of all the rebellious spirits," and his ministers \nLucifuge Rofocale, Prince Beelzebub, and Count Ashtoreth. 4B Mag- \nic Papyri that had been early models for these books often confused the \nnames and attributes of Jehovah and Lucifer, speaking of "God the \nlight-bringer (Lucifer), invincible, who knoweth what is in the heart of \nall life, who of the dust hath formed the race of men." 44 We have \nseen the same kind of confusion in Christian theology itself. Yet in \n14th-century Toulouse, witches were burned for saying what was \nactually a tenet of the church\'s dualism: that "God and the Devil were \ncompletely equal, the former reigning over the sky and the latter the \nearth; all souls which the Devil managed to seduce were lost to the \nMost High God and lived perpetually on earth or in the air." 45 \n\nEven up to the 20th century, churchmen insisted on the devilish \npact. Father Thurston wrote: "In the face of Holy Scripture and the \nteaching of the Fathers and theologians the abstract possibility of a pact \nwith the Devil and of a diabolical interference in human affairs can \nhardly be denied." 46 But the Fathers and theologians never explained \nhow the devil could profit from the pact, other than to receive a \n"soul" that was his anyway. As Samuel Butler said, no one heard the \ndevil\'s side of any story, because God wrote all the books. 47 \n\nOne might think an "enlightened" modern society would have \ngiven up the idea of the devil. But a poll taken in 1978 showed "two \nout of five Americans believe in devils." 48 The strange viability of devils \nmay arise from their usefulness in assuaging the guilt of God and \nman. "Both Judaism and Christianity have maintained that God must \nbe given the credit for all the goodness in human history, and that \nmen must take the blame for all the evil." 49 Thus, the real purpose of \nthe devil was to take some of this heavy responsibility off frail human \nshoulders. In short: the devil, not Christ, was the true scapegoat who \nassumed the burden of men\'s sins. \n\n1. Larousse, 317. 2. Scot, 444. 3. Tennant, 13. 4. Briffault 2, 564. \n\n5. Scot, 323-25. 6. J.H.

In Tantric Tibet, the divine essence of the Earth-goddess \nTara is still assumed to inhabit her human incarnation, the Diamond \nSow, traditional consort or feminine counterpart of the Dalai Lama. \n\nBecause diamonds were sacred to the supreme Goddess, they were \ntaken over by the cult of the Virgin; and because of this association \nwith virginity they came to be considered appropriate betrothal gifts. In \nthe transition from Tarot cards to modern playing cards, diamonds \nreplaced the ancient suit of pentacles, which were symbols of Mother \nEarth (Tara) and of the feminine earth element. \n\n\n\n232 \n\n\n\ni \n\n\n\nDiana \n\n"Queen of Heaven," Roman name for the Triple Goddess as (1) \nLunar Virgin, (2) Mother of Creatures, and (3) the Huntress (Destroy- \ner). Her Greek name was Artemis. Her major pilgrimage centers \nwere Ephesus and Nemi, the Sacred Grove. She was Dione, Diana \nNemorensis, or Nemetona, Goddess of the Moon-grove. In her \nsanctuaries, sacred kings periodically engaged in combat, the loser dying \nas the god Hippolytus, the winner invested as the Goddess\'s new \nfavorite, Virbius. See Hippolytus, Saint. \n\nAs Diana Egeria, patroness of childbirth, nursing, and healing, the \nGoddess made Nemi\'s holy spring the Lourdes of pagan Rome. 1 The \nlegendary King Numa was said to have derived all his wisdom from a \nsacred marriage with her. \n\nDiana\'s cult was so widespread in the pagan world that early \nChristians viewed her as their major rival, which is why she later \nbecame "Queen of Witches." The Gospels commanded total destruc- \ntion of all temples of Diana, the Great Goddess worshipped by "Asia \nand all the world" (Acts 19:27). \n\nRoman towns all over Europe habitually called the local mother \ngoddess Diana, as later Christian towns were to call her Madonna. \nFortunatus said Diana was the Goddess worshipped at Vernemeton, \n"which in the Gaulish language means the Great Shrine." In the 5th \ncentury a.d., the Gauls regarded her as their supreme deity. Christians \nspoke slightingly of their pagan custom of adoring the spirit of Diana \nin a cut branch or a log of wood. 2 Gozbert, a 7th-century Frankish \nchieftain, doubted the claims of a Christian missionary on the ground \nthat the Christian God was "no better than our own Diana." 3 \n\nAt Ephesus, the Goddess was called Mother of Animals, Lady of \nWild Creatures, and Many-Breasted Artemis, shown with her entire \ntorso covered with breasts to nourish the world\'s creatures. 4 In the 4th \ncentury a.d., the church took over this shrine and re-dedicated it to \nthe virgin Mary. 5 One of the earliest churches devoted to "Our Lady" \nexisted at Ephesus in 43 1 ; but most of the people believed the Lady \nwas Diana, not Mary. In 432 the Council of Ephesus tried to eliminate \nworship of the pagan Goddess, but the bishops were besieged by \ncrowds demanding, "Give us our Diana of the Ephesians!" 6 \n\nAn excuse for converting Diana\'s temples into Mary\'s churches \nwas provided by a made-to-order legend that Mary lived at Ephesus \nin her old age. Her tomb was located there, and some Christians even \npointed out the house in which she had lived. 7 But sometimes she \nwas identified with the sinister Widow of Ephesus, a Crone aspect of \nthe Goddess showing some primitive features. \n\nPetronius\'s version of the myth said the Widow hung her hus- \nband\'s dead body on one of the three crosses in front of Diana\'s \ntemple, replacing the body of a previously crucified thief. Then she lay \nwith her new lover at the foot of the cross. 8 The parallel between this \nimage and that of the triple Mary at the foot of Jesus\'s cross was too \n\n\n\nDiana \n\n\n\nVenantius Honorius \nClementianus \nFortunatus 6th- \ncentury poet, bishop of \nPoitiers, still venerated \nas a saint in France. \n\n\n\n233 \n\n\n\nDiana close for comfort, especially since Diana herself was assimilated to the \n\nChristian myth as Mary\'s mother, or elder self, the "Grandmother of \n^^^^^^^^^^^ God" under the name of either Anna (Hannah) or Di-anna \n(Dinah). 9 \n\nGnostic Christians called their Wisdom-goddess Sophia the same \nGrandmother of God, and frequently identified her with Diana of \nEphesus. When Diana\'s temple was finally pulled down, as the Gospels \nordered, its magnificent porphyry pillars were carried to Constantino- \nple and built into the church of Holy Sophia. 10 \n\nThe magic of Ephesus was remembered through the Middle Ages. \nA writer said in 1725: "It is recorded in divers authors that in the \nimage of Diana, which was worshipped at Ephesus, there were certain \nobscure words or sentences . . . written upon the feet, girdle and \ncrown of the said Diana: the which, if a man did use, having written \nthem out, and carrying them about him, he should have good luck in \nall his businesses." 11 \n\nSome Christians even remembered that Diana was once the triple \ndeity who ruled the world. A 14th-century poem attributed to the \nBishop of Meaux said Diana was an old name for the Trinity. 12 \n\nOfficers of the Inquisition however regarded Diana as the "God- \ndess of the heathen" with whom witches made their aerial night \njourneys or thought they did. 13 The worship of Diana was denounced \nwherever it was found, even when the worshippers were members of \nthe clergy. In the 14th century, a bishop found the monks of Frithel- \nstock Priory worshipping a statue of "the unchaste Diana" at an altar \nin the woods, and made them destroy it. 14 The notorious inquisitor \nTorquemada declared bluntly that Diana is the devil. 15 \n\nDevil or not, Diana ruled the wild forests of Europe through the \nmedieval period. As patron of the forest of Ardennes she was Dea \nArduenna; as patron of the Black Forest she was Dea Abnoba. 16 \nSerbians, Czechs, and Poles knew her as the woodland Moon- \ngoddess Diiwica, Devana, or Dziewona. 17 She remained the Goddess \nof wild woodlands and hunting, all the way up to the 18th century in \nEngland. \n\nDianic rites were celebrated even in church, despite objections \n\nfrom the clergy. A minister wrote against the traditional parade of a \n\nstag\'s head into St. Paul\'s Cathedral in London: "bringing in procession \n\ninto the church the head of a deer, fixed on the top of a long spear or \n\npole, with the whole company blowing Hunters Horns in a sort of \n\nhideous manner; and with this rude pomp they go up to the High \n\nAltar, and offer it there. You would think them all the mad Votaries of \n\nDiana." 18 \n\nl.Frazer,G.B.,5,10. 2. Graves, W.G., 273-74. 3. Reinach, 153. \n\n4. Neumann, G.M., pi. 35. 5. Ashe, 185. 6. Legman, 661. 7.

His only fault was that he never existed. \n\nDionysius\'s works were forged about the 6th century a.d. and \npalmed off as the work of one Dionysius the first bishop of Athens, \nsupposedly converted to Christianity by St. Paul personally, during the \nlatter\'s spirit-visit to Greece as a ghost, after having been "caught up \nto the third heaven." Paul told pseudo-Dionysius about heaven, and \npseudo-Dionysius wrote it down and preached it from the Athenian \nHill of Ares; hence his title, Areopagite. \n\nThe medieval church based its organization of three sacraments, \nthree holy orders, and three lower orders on the spurious revelations \nof Dionysius, in imitation of the heavenly hierarchy he described, \nconsisting of (1) Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; (2) Dominions, \nVirtues, and Powers; (3) Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. The \nspirits of heaven remained thus organized all the way up to the 18th \ncentury. \n\nChurchmen reluctantly abandoned their belief in the authenticity \nof Dionysius\'s writings when it was pointed out that, despite earlier \nscholars\' unquestioning acceptance, they failed the simplest of chrono- \nlogical tests, constantly referring to events and institutions of much \nlater date than the time of the alleged Dionysius. 1 At first the pious tried \nto pretend these references were miraculous prophecies of the future, \nbut this defense proved untenable. \n\n1. White 2, 315-16. \n\n\n\nDionysus \n\nIdentified with many other savior-gods, Dionysus was also called \nBacchus, Zagreus, Sabazius, Adonis, Antheus, Zalmoxis, Pentheus, \nPan, Liber Pater, or "the Liberator." l His totem was a panther (Pan- \nthereos, the Beast of Pan). His emblem was the thyrsus, a phallic scepter \ntipped with a pine cone. His priestesses were the Maenads, or \nBacchantes, who celebrated his orgies with drunkenness, nakedness, and \nsacramental feasting. \n\nDionysus is often presented as a rustic wine-god, inventor of \nviniculture. He was more than that. He was a prototype of Christ, \nwith a cult center at Jerusalem as well as nearly every other major city in \nthe middle east. Plutarch said the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was \ncelebrated in his honor: "I think that the festival of the Sabbath is not \nwholly without relation to the festival of Dionysus." 2 He added that \nthe Jews abstain from pork because their god Dionysus-Adonis (Lord \nDionysus) was slain by a boar. In the 1st century B.C. the Jews \nthemselves claimed to worship Dionysus under his Phrygian name of \nZeus Sabazius. 5 \n\nTacitus said Dionysus Liber was the god of Jerusalem in a former \n\n\n\n236 \n\n\n\ntime, but a different god had replaced him, a god with less attractive Dionysus \n\ncharacteristics: "Liber established a festive and cheerful worship, while \n\nthe Jewish religion is tasteless and mean." 4 Dionysus and Jehovah \n\nwere literally two sides of the same coin in the 5th century B.C., when ^\'"\'^^^^^^^^ \n\ncoins found near Gaza showed Dionysus on one side, and on the \n\nother a bearded figure labeled JHWH Jehovah. 5 \n\nIn Lebanon, Dionysus was incarnated in Ampelus, a "beautiful \nyouth" torn to pieces by a bull and reincarnated as a grapevine. In \nChios, the blood of men murdered by Dionysus\'s Maenads was used to \nfertilize the vines. At Orchomenus, the Triple Goddess appeared in \nDionysian rites as "three princesses" who tore apart a male child and ate \nhim (the earth absorbing sacrificial blood). In Thebes, a king named \nPentheus dared to oppose the Dionysian cult, perhaps because he didn\'t \ncare to die like other Dionysian god-kings. But the women tore him \nto pieces anyway, led by the king\'s own mother (or mother-goddess), \nwho wrenched his head off. 6 Later Theban rites of Dionysus cen- \ntered on killing and eating a fawn named Pentheus, and the Maenads \nwore fawn skins. The god\'s Lydian totem was a fox, Bassareus, \nforerunner of the medieval Reynard. There the Maenads called them- \nselves Bassarids, and wore fox skins. 7 \n\nThese darker legends show Dionysus\'s typical "savior" pattern: \nfirst and most primitive, a king killed and cannibalized to provide both \nthe earth and women\'s wombs with fructifying blood; then a surrogate \nfor the king, a condemned criminal or a young man chosen by lot; \nthen an animal substitute for the man; and finally, "flesh" and "blood" \ndevoured in the form of bread and wine, the classical Dionysian \nsacrament at Eleusis. \n\nIn Palestine, Dionysus was identified with Noah, the first biblical \npatriarch to get drunk (Genesis 9:21). His Greek title was Deucalion, \n"New-wine sailor," the flood hero in pre-Hellenic myths. 8 Dionysus \nwas also a form of Adam, offspring of Father Heaven and Mother \nEarth (Zeus and Demeter), torn to pieces to make a sin offering of the \n"wine" of his blood. 9 His later hero-incarnation Orpheus, star of the \npopular Orphic Mysteries, was the same sacrificial god, torn to pieces by \nthe Maenads. Proclus said, "Orpheus, because he was the principal in \nthe Dionysian rites, is said to have suffered the same fate as the god." 10 \n\nOrpheus was a third-generation savior, identified with his divine \n[father Dionysus as Dionysus was identified with his divine father \nZeus. Seated on the Heavenly Father\'s throne, brandishing his light- \nning-scepter, Dionysus was hailed as King of Kings and God of \nGods. 11 He was also the god-begotten, virgin-born Anointed One \nUChristos) whose mother seems to have been all three forms of the \nTriple Goddess: the earth mother, Persephone the underworld queen, \nSemele the moon-maiden. Hints of a hanging or crucifixion ceremo- \nny appeared in his sacrificial title Dendrites, "Young Man of the \n[Tree." 12 He was also a Horned God, with such forms as bull, goat, \nand stag. \n\nAccording to the classic story of his dismemberment, the god took \n\n237 \n\n\n\nDionysus \n\n\n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and \ngeographer of the 2nd \ncentury a.d. Living in \na time of declining \nculture, he was \ninspired by a desire to \ndescribe the ancient \nsacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nsuch animal forms in rapid succession to avoid the onslaught of the \nTitans (pre-Hellenic earth-deities), who eventually caught him, tore \nhim to pieces, and devoured him. They trapped his soul in a mirror \nwhile he was admiring his reflection, which equates Dionysus with the \nspring-flower god Narcissus, another of his many disguises. Accord- \ning to Pausanias, it was Onomakritos who made the Titans into \n"authors of Dionysus\'s sufferings," but the orgia had not included \nthis detail of old. Probably one of the god\'s oldest forms was Dionysus \nMelanaigis, "Dionysus of the Black Goatskin," a scapegoat-satyr like \nMarsyas. 13 His traditional costume contributed much to the medieval \nChristian notion of the devil\'s habit of appearing in the form of a \nblack goat. \n\nAt Eleusis, the place of his "Advent," Dionysus appeared as a \nnewborn Holy Child laid in a winnowing-basket, liknon, from which \nhe was called Dionysus Liknites. This sacred object, his cradle, was \ncarried in his processions by a special functionary called a likno- \nphoros, cradle-bearer. 14 The liknon was the original form of the \n"manger" in which the infant Jesus was laid. All grain-gods, whose \nflesh was eaten in the form of bread, appeared as newborn babes in a \nvessel intended for seed corn. \n\nA long-remembered incarnation of the god was King Dionysus of \n\nSyracuse, who altered the custom of king-sacrifice in the 4th century \n\nB.C. When the time of his immolation approached, King Dionysus \n\nsubstituted for himself a courtier who was called Damocles, meaning \n\neither "Conquering Glory" or "Glory of Blood." Damocles was said to \n\nhave volunteered to take the king\'s place because he envied the \n\nprivileges of kingship. He enjoyed these privileges for a short while, but \n\nsoon discovered a sword suspended above his head by a single hair: \n\nsymbol of the fate of kings, in a time when they and the gods they \n\nembodied were periodically fated to die. 15 See Kingship. \n\n1.

Each wore \nhis half of the egg shell as a cap or crown. The twins were named \nCastor and Polydeuces, the latter meaning "abundant wine," perhaps a \nreference to the flowing blood of the solar Savior whom the twins \nushered in and out of the underworld in rites linked with fertility. 1 The \nname of Castor has been associated with the rite of castrating the god, \nin classical paganism defined as "the act of offering the phallus to the \nLove Goddess." 2 \n\n\n\n238 \n\n\n\nThe Love Goddess was called Venus in Rome, and her planet is Diotima \n\nthe same one that appears as both morning and evening "star." Djsj r \n\nPerhaps this was why Christians associated Pollux, the Roman form of \n\nPolydeuces, with "pollution." Like Shaher and Shalem in the land of \nCanaan, the Heavenly Twins announced the daily birth of the sun with \nthe words "He is risen," and sent him into the underworld at his daily \ndeath with the word "Peace" (Shalom, or Salaam). See Lucifer. \n\nTo Mithraic sun-worshippers the Dioscuri were symbolized by \ntwo golden stars, which still appear in the heavens as the Alpha and \nBeta stars of the constellation Gemini (the Twins). When the Dioscuri \nwere shown in anthropomorphic form in Mithraic shrines, they held \nspears or torches, one upward, the other downward, signifying the rising \nand setting directions of the sun. Their pose was standard: one twin \nhad the right leg crossed over the left, the other had the left leg crossed \nover the right. 3 The same "magic 4" leg position is seen on the \nEmperor card of the Tarot trumps. The Dioscuri were revered in \nSparta as horsemen, warriors, and war dancers. \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1, 249; 2, 406. 2. Jobes, 179. 3.

In Britain, Dis was regarded as a universal deity very like Jehovah, \nwhose later adherents, however, transformed Dis into an alternative \nname for the devil. 2 \n\n1 . Umusse, 211. 2.

Mohammedans viewed the \ndjinn as pagan semi-demons because they were connected with the \nOld Religion. See Genius. \n\n\n\nDog \n\nNo one knows when man first domesticated the dog. Evidence \nsuggests that "man" didn\'t do it at all; woman did it. In myth, dogs \naccompanied only the Goddess, guarding the gates of her after-world, \nhelping her to receive the dead. \n\nLike other carrion eaters e.g., vultures dogs, wolves, and jack- \nals were associated with funerary customs. Dogs carried the dead to \ntheir Mother. In Iran, even after it became usual to bury the dead, it was \nthought necessary to let dogs tear the corpse before burial, a survival \nof the older practice. 1 The Vendidad said the soul enroute to heaven \nwould meet the Goddess with her dogs: "Then comes the beautiful, \nwell-shapen, strong and graceful maid, with the dogs at her sides, one \nwho can discern, who has many children, happy and of high \nunderstanding. She makes the soul of the righteous go up above." 2 \n\nSemitic tradition transformed the Goddess into the Angel of \nDeath, whose approach can be seen only by dogs which is why \ndogs howl at the moon to announce a death. 3 Devonshire folklore still \nsays there is a dog in the moon who acts as a messenger of death. 4 \nThe Irish say two dogs guard the gate of death, which used to lead to \nEmania, the Moon-land; mourners were enjoined not to wail too \nloudly, lest they disturb the dogs and cause them to attack the soul at the \ngate. This and many other similar images can be traced to the ancient \nVedic concept of the moon as death\'s gate, ruled by the Goddess and \nguarded by her two dogs. 5 \n\n\n\n240 \n\n\n\n\'*ty \n\n\n\nThis Oriental symbol is still seen in an almost pure form on Tarot \ntrump #18, the card of the Moon. The conventional picture is of two \ndogs howling at the full moon in front of a gate, or two pylons, with a \nroad leading between them to a distant horizon. The scene was \nusually interpreted as having to do with death. 6 Sometimes the card was \ncalled Hecate, after the classic death-goddess whose totemic compan- \nions were dogs. 7 Her gates were guarded by the three-headed hound \nCerberus, "Spirit of the Pit." 8 In Celtic myth the gatekeeper was a \ndog named Dormarth, "Death\'s Door." 9 The same dog might be seen \non the famous Gundestrup Cauldron, guarding the yonic gate \nthrough which heroes pass on their way to death and transfiguration. 10 \n\nAccording to the Vedic tradition, the Bitch-goddess Sarama was \nthe mistress of the death dogs, and a divine huntress like Artemis, \nDiana, Anath, and other western versions of the lunar maiden. 11 \nAncient Babylon knew her as Gula, the Fate-goddess, whose symbol \nwas a dog. 12 She was assimilated to Ishtar, whose sacred king Tammuz \nwas torn to pieces by "dogs." B Under his Greek names of Adonis or \nActaeon, he was torn to pieces by the Dogs of Artemis. As the savior \nOrpheus, he was incarnated in Neanthus of Lesbos and torn to pieces \nin the Orphic temple by "dogs. " H When Athene assumed the guise of \nthe death-goddess, her priestesses filled her temple with canine \n"howlings" (houloi), like wolves or dogs singing to the moon. 15 Some- \ntimes a whole pack of dogs or priestesses? hunted souls in the \nrealm of death, like the Celtic Hounds of Annwn, which Christians \nsoon converted into the Hounds of Hell. 16 \n\nOriginally this meant the hounds of the Goddess Hel, ruler of the \nland of death. Norse myth said she gave birth to lunar wolf-dogs who \nate the flesh of the dead and carried souls to paradise. Their leader was \nManagarm, "Moon-Dog." The Prose Edda says Managarm was \n"gorged with the flesh of the death-doomed; and with red blood he \nreddens the dwelling of the gods." 17 In other words, he carried the \ndead away in primitive, carrion-eating canine fashion. \n\nAn alternative name for the Norse moon-dogs\' mother was Angur- \nboda, the Hag of the Iron Wood: an older version of Hel, sometimes \ncalled Hel\'s mother. 18 Two of Angurboda\'s canine children, Geri and \nFreki, lived in Valhalla and ate the food offered on "Odin\'s table," \nmeaning the altar. 19 This suggests that the Vedic image of the two death \ndogs passed into Norse mythology as a pair of canine gods, like the \nmany holy dogs, wolves, or jackals of the ancient world in general. \n\nOne of the oldest of these gods was Egyptian Anubis, brought \nfrom central Asia at a very early date under the name of Up-Uat, \n"Opener of the Way." He was also known as Mates, "He of the \nMother," similar to the archaic Irish word for a dog, madra. 20 This \nold Asian god was said to be a wolf, but he soon merged with the jackal \nAnubis, who was called his twin. The composite was a deity "whose \nface is like unto that of a greyhound . . . who feedeth on the dead . . . \nwho devoureth the bodies of the dead, and swalloweth hearts." In the \n\n\n\nDog \n\n\n\nProse Edda \n\nIcelandic saga, a \ncollection of traditional \nstories compiled by \nSnorri Sturluson in the \n13 th century a.d. \n\n\n\n241 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD8 predynastic period he governed sacrificial priests, "jackal-headed men \n\nwith slaughtering-knives," in an old section of the underworld. 21 \nmhmm^^^^^m Coptic Christians later identified Anubis with Cabriel, who was called a \njudge of the dead. 22 \n\nAs a lord of the land of death, Anubis became the god of \nmummification. He was often shown bending solicitously over the \nmummy of Osiris, applying the preservative mumiya from which the \nword "mummy" descended. When the Osiris cult became astrologi- \ncal, much of its imagery was transposed from the underworld to the \nheavens, including the image of Anubis. \n\nThe star of Anubis was Sothis (Sirius), the Eye of the Dog, in \nGreek, Canopis. Sirius is the star forming the "eye" of Canis Major, the \nGreat Dog. It is the brightest star in the sky. Egyptians believed it \nheld the soul of Osiris, whose rebirth coincided with the rising of the \nNile flood, when his star rose in the east. "Three wise men" pointed \nthe way to the newborn Savior: the three stars in Orion\'s belt, which \nform a line pointing to Sirius. The holy city of Anubis on earth was \nalso Canopis, the Eye of the Dog, origin of the canopic mummy-jar. \n\nAnubis came to Rome as a leading character in the Osirian \nMysteries. He was seen in processions "condescending to walk on \nhuman feet . . . rearing terrifically high his dog\'s head and neck that \nmessenger between heaven and hell displaying alternately a face \nblack as night, and golden as the day; in his left the caduceus, in his right \nwaving aloft the green palm branch. His steps were closely followed \nby a cow, raised into an upright posture the cow being the fruitful \nemblem of the Universal Parent, the goddess herself, which one of \nthe happy train carried with majestic steps, supported on his shoulders. \nBy another was borne the coffin containing the sacred things, and \nclosely concealing the deep secrets of the holy religion." 23 \n\nNot only Anubis, but many other dog-deities were worshipped \nthroughout the Roman empire. An early Roman cista from Pales- \ntrina-Praeneste showed the Moon-virgin Minerva sacrificing a naked \nMars over a cauldron, attended by her three-headed death dog, \nclearly the same as Persephone\'s or Hecate\'s Cerberus. 24 The dog as \nthe keeper of Mother\'s gate was known everywhere in antiquity, \nprobably because wild dogs were first domesticated as guardians of the \nhome threshold, doorways being generally sacred to women who \nowned the houses. In Assyria, images of dogs were buried under \nthresholds of houses, suggesting similar burials of deceased watchdogs \nin former times. 25 The dogs\' spirits continued to halt intruders, which \nmay account for the ancient custom of lifting a new bride over a \nthreshold, so the guardian spirits beneath would not think her an \nintruder but would accept her as a resident. \n\nThe Cynic sage Diogenes made himself a watchdog at the gate of \nthe Great Mother\'s temple, where he lived in "a large earthen pot," \nrepresenting the terrestrial womb. 26 Cynics were the Goddess\'s "doglike \nones" (kynikos). Their sect, founded in the 4th century B.C., professed \n\n\n\n242 \n\n\n\nto foretell the end of the world from the circumpolar constellation Ursa Dog \n\nMinor, which they called the Dog. The north pole star was the Dog\'s \n\nTail, kunos oura, the Cynosure. 27 When it moved from its place at the \n\nstill point of the turning world, according to the Cynics, the end of \nthe present universe was at hand. \n\nThe Cynic idea of the dog affixed to the north pole is still found in \nEuropean folklore. Slavs spoke of the three Zorya (triple Fate- \ngoddess), keeping "a dog which is tied by an iron chain to the \nconstellation of the Little Bear. When the chain breaks it will be the \nend of the world." 28 Egyptians similarly believed the Goddess kept \n"powers of darkness" fettered by a heavenly chain until the last days \nof the world. 29 Northern peoples said the chain held the cosmic \ndoomsday-wolf Fenrir, who would be released by the Norns (triple \nFate-goddess) to devour the heavenly father at the end of the world; this \nwould signal the destruction of all the gods. 30 Norsemen therefore \ncalled doomsday the Day of the Wolf. 31 \n\nThe Great Goddess was herself a wolf, in the very old Roman cult \nof the She- Wolf Lupa, whose original consort was Lupus, the Wolf. \nHe was also Feronius, or Dis Pater, a subterranean wolf god inherited \nfrom the Etruscans, as was the She- Wolf who suckled Rome\'s \nfounders, Romulus and Remus. The famous Lupercalian statue of the \nShe- Wolf was cast in bronze during the 5th century B.C. The two \nbabies under her belly were not part of the original work but were added \ncenturies later, to suit the Roman version of the legend. 32 \n\nThe Lupercalia may have been a corruption of Lupa-Kali; the \nOriental Great Goddess was also a she-wolf. Under her yoni-name of \nCunti she gave birth to a divine son "in the cave of the wolf," like the \nLupercal grotto. Her child was placed in a basket of rushes and set \nafloat on the Ganges, as Romulus and Remus were set afloat on the \nTiber, Moses was set afloat on the Nile, and Sargon was set afloat on \nthe Euphrates. The wolf bitch Lupa was identified with the midwife- \ngoddess Acca Larentia who took Romulus and Remus from their \nbasket, just as Akka took Sargon, and "pharaoh\'s daughter" (another \nversion of Akka) took Moses. Akka, Acca, or Acco was the same as \nHecate, who turned into a wolf bitch in Homeric legend. 33 Lupa (or \nAcca) disappeared into the sacred spring of the Lupercal grotto, \nwhere her spirit was worshipped every year at the Lupercalian festival. \n\nThere were many lupine foster-mothers in Middle-Eastern myths. \nTu Kueh, legendary founder of the Turkish nation, was preserved in \ninfancy by a holy she-wolf whom he subsequently married: that is, she \nwas the Goddess of the land in totemic form. 34 A famous Turkish \nleader was Ataturk, "the Gray Wolf." 35 Zoroaster was raised by a she- \nwolf. Cyrus the Great, born of Mandane (Moon-mother), was \nnursed by a woman whose Greek name was Cyno, her Median name \nSpako, meaning "Bitch." Siegfried too was a wolf\'s foster child; his \noldest name was Wolfdietrich. 36 \n\nThe oldest religion of the Canary Islands was a dog- or wolf-cult, \n\n\n\n243 \n\n\n\nDog traces of which are still seen in many ancient canine statues. Canary \n\nbirds and canary wine took their name from the islands, which were \n\n^^ mmmmmm ^^^^ am really named for Canis, the dog. 37 \n\nThe same name once applied to the hereditary caste of Jewish \npriests, Kohen or Cohen, from Greek kuon, "dog." 58 Because dogs \nwere associated with the old matriarchy, the epithet "dog" became an \ninsult to Semitic patriarchs; Islam forbids both women and dogs to \napproach a shrine. 59 Yet Moslems still incongruously believe the gall of \na black dog can serve as a holy amulet to purge an entire household \nof evil influences. 40 \n\nEarly Christians made an effort to assimilate the Gallo-Roman \nwolf god under the name of St. Lupus or St. Loup, "Holy Wolf." 41 \nHe was made a legendary bishop of Troyes, credited with miraculously \nturning back the invading Huns from his province; but this story was \nfiction masquerading as history. 42 The church was not wholly comfort- \nable with any of the manifestations of Lupus, who was really a \nprototype of the werewolf. Saxons used to worship him in the first \nmonth of the sacred year, called Wolf-monath (Wolf Month); but \nChristian authorities changed the name of this month to After- Yule, or \nJesu-monath. Its runic sign was a dot in a circle, the same as the \nFestival of the Circumcision of Christ (New Year\'s Day). 43 \n\nDiana the Huntress and her "dogs" had an extensive cult in \nEngland. Some of her legends merged with those of Arthur, Lance- \nlot, and other British heroes. One of the tales told how Lancelot, like \nActaeon, trespassed in the Goddess\'s greenwood and fell asleep at her \nsecret spring: \n\nThere was a Lady dwelt in that forest, and she was a great huntress, and \ndaily she used to hunt, and ever she bare her bow with her; and no man \nwent never with her, but always women, and they were shooters, and \ncould well kill a deer, both at the stalk and at the trest; and they daily \nbare bows and arrows, horns and wood knives, and many good dogs they \nhad. 44 \n\nWhen the "Lady" caught Lancelot in the forbidden place, she \ndidn\'t set her dogs on him as her forerunners had done. She only shot \nhim in the buttock, "that he might not sit on no saddle." 45 Thus he \nwas disgraced, since a warrior was supposed to show wounds only in \nfront. \n\nBecause dogs were natural companions of the housewife as well as \nthe huntress, they were often cited as witches\' familiars. A black dog \nseemed even more suspect than a black cat. The dog was frequently \nbelieved to be the animal form of a demon lover, probably because \nwomen were inclined to fondle their dogs; many women were hanged \nin England on that count alone. One witch was officially condemned \nfor having "carnal copulation with the devil in the likeness of a man, but \nhe removed from her in the likeness of a black dog." 46 \n\nGypsies told a story based on such witch trials: there was a \nbeautiful maiden whose lover was her dog. Once each year he \n\n\n\n244 \n\n\n\ntransformed himself into a man and lay with her. In due time, she gave Dog \n\nbirth to a "little white puppy," then she jumped into the river and \n\ndrowned (a popular method of disposing of witches was to drown them ^^^^_^^^__ \n\nin the so-called swimming ordeal). The demon lover assumed his \n\nhuman shape, retrieved the maiden\'s corpse, and brought her back to \n\nlife by placing the puppy-child at her breast to suck. Afterward, as in \n\nall fairy tales, they married and lived happily ever after. 47 \n\nThe black dog was the witch\'s helper in gathering materials for \ncharms. According to an exceptionally durable superstition, the \nmiraculous mandrake root could not be pulled out of the ground except \nby a black dog. This curiously formed root, called "the phallus of the \nfield," or "the devil\'s genitals," was supposed to emit a scream if \nuprooted by the unwary; and all who heard the sound would go \ninsane, or die. 48 \n\nThe Irish remembered the dog\'s connection with death and \nmaintained that true curses could be cast with a dog\'s help. Among \nthe Celts, cainte, "dog," denoted a satiric bard with magic power to \nspeak curses that would come true. 49 \n\nDogs or wolves played their ancient role of psychopomps in a \nnumber of strange stories about cathedral-building, which might be \ntraced all the way back to the Etruscan Lupus or Dis Pater, the wolf- \nheaded Lord of Death who carried sacrificial victims away. In the very \nold rite of the mundus, trenches dug for temple foundations were \nfilled with sacrificial blood. It was believed the building would be \nunstable if this blood-magic were omitted; so it was done, from Hindu \nIndia to Latium and Britain. Lupus appeared in sacred art as a wolf- \nangel carrying the victim to a blessed after-life. On an Etruscan vase, \nthe death-god Charon is assimilated to Lupus and wears a wolfskin. 50 \n\nThis notion that sacred buildings needed to be founded in blood \nhas been evident in every tradition including the Judeo-Christian \none. The Bible says when Hiel founded the city of Jericho, "he laid the \nfoundation thereof in (the blood of) Abiram his firstborn and set up \nthe gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of \nthe Lord" (1 Kings 16:34). British legend said Vortigern\'s temple \nwalls kept falling down because the blood sacrifice for their foundation \nhad been forgotten. 51 Such pagan customs continued in the Middle \nAges. Many skeletons have been found buried in walls, pillars, and \ncornerstones of churches and abbeys, placed there as supportive \nsacrifices. 52 A deaf-mute was buried under the cornerstone of a monas- \ntery near Gottingen. 53 A parish church at Holsworthy, North Devon, \nwas found in 1845 to have a skeleton in its southwest wall. 54 Illegitimate \nchildren were frequently buried in building foundations. One St. \nBenezet, or Little Bennet, was walled up in the foundation of a bridge \nat Avignon in 1 184. Five centuries later his crypt was opened, and \nSt. Benezet proved his saintly status by remaining fresh and unde- \ncayed. 55 So his ecclesiastical press agents claimed, at any rate. "It was \nreally a common thing among Christians to sacrifice children, maids, or \n\n\n\n245 \n\n\n\nDog \n\n\n\nChansons de gestes \n\nOld French epic \npoetry of the 11th to \n1 3th centuries. \n\n\n\ngrown-up people by burying them alive under the foundations of \ncastles, etc., to insure their stability." 56 \n\nWhen St. Columba founded a monastery on the island of Iona, he \ncalled for a volunteer to be buried alive in its foundation. A monk \nnamed Oran, or Odran, earned a later canonization by offering \nhimself. 57 For some reason perhaps a promise of Christ-like resurrec- \ntion he was dug up again after three days. Still alive, he began to \npreach blasphemous doctrines: there was no God, no devil, no heaven \nor hell. St. Columba therefore had him killed and re-buried. 58 It was \nnot uncommon for monks infected with Gnostic, agnostic, or atheistic \nbeliefs to meet with such a fate. \n\nEurope\'s totemic dog or wolf clans seem to have become involved \nin these sacrificial customs, just as they were involved in the ancient \ncult of the mundus. For instance, Cologne Cathedral was said to have \nbeen designed by the devil, and its bells were cast under the devil\'s \ndirection at the foundry of a mysterious smith named Wolf. After \ncasting a certain discordant bell, supposed to be rung only in time of \ndisaster, Wolf was killed by a fall from the bell tower. The architect who \ncollaborated with the devil was also killed, crushed by a great stone \nthat already had his name engraved on it. 59 \n\nChansons de gestes told a somewhat different version. The build- \ners of Cologne Cathedral killed a hero named Renaud (Fox) and \nburied him in the foundation. A church was erected to Renaud\'s \nmemory in 81 1 a.d.; a chapel stood on the spot in Cologne where he \nwas slain. 60 Some said Renaud was the same as the trickster-hero- \ndemigod Reynard the Fox; others said he was a great warrior, one of \nCharlemagne\'s paladins. \n\nThe devil and the wolf were also linked with Charlemagne\'s tomb \nat Aix-la-Chapelle. The devil contributed money to build the cathe- \ndral. In return, he demanded the life of the first creature to enter its \ndoors. At the dedication ceremony, people thrust a wolf into the \ndoor. The devil took the wolfs life. Then it was safe for people to enter. \nLike Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle had a discordant bell for emergencies. \nThe founder of this bell was crushed to death by the clapper, so the bell \nwas baptized with his blood. \n\nSimilar stories were told of Strasbourg Cathedral, supposedly \ndesigned by a wise witch named Sabine, once a title of Lupa, the \nSabine She- Wolf. The dedication of the cathedral was marked by the \nsacrifice of twin brothers, like Romulus and Remus, one of whom \nkilled the other by pushing him under a cornerstone as it was dropped \ninto place. (Of the twins nursed by the Sabine She- Wolf, Romulus \nkilled Remus while digging a furrow for the foundation of Rome\'s \nwalls.) The bishop of Strasbourg ordered the cornerstone raised \nagain, and the second brother was crushed under it also, by his wish. He \nexplained, "My body will serve as a protection to the cathedral." 61 \n\nRemnants of these curious beliefs and customs survived to the \npresent time. In World War II, the Nazi SS caused human bodies to \n\n\n\n246 \n\n\n\nbe "encased in the concrete fortifications and bunkers, as though such Dolcinists \n\nbodies could give strength to inanimate matter." 62 To this day, Greek \n\npeasants insist on a blood sacrifice at the building of any bridge, to bathe ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe foundation in the lifeblood of a bird or animal to "strengthen" \n\nit." \n\nThe notion that a dog\'s blood is equivalent to the blood of a \nhuman being is still found among the Berbers, who believe that a \nmurderer is magically tainted by the blood of his victim for the rest of his \nlife. The killer of a dog is similarly tainted. 64 Nearly everywhere one \ncan still find the belief that dogs can see ghosts and other spirits, left over \nfrom the formerly universal association of canines with the world of \ndeath and the special preserve of the underground Goddess. 65 \n\n1.

Believing himself nevertheless a true spiritual \nson of St. Francis, he gathered disciples and preached against the \nworldly wealth of the church. He was caught and burned, but the \nCongregation continued under Fra Dolcino, who preached the oncom- \ning doomsday, the fall of the sinful church, and the triumph of the \npoor and simple over the theocracy. \n\nDolcinists admitted women to their ranks, and granted their \n"sisters in Christ" the same right to preach and lead prayers as the \nmen, one of the worst manifestations of their heresy. Dolcinists claimed \nto renounce sexual relations; so when Dolcino\'s particular "dearly \nbeloved sister in Christ" Margherita di Trank bore him a child, it was \nbrought about through the miraculous agency of the Holy Ghost, \nthey said. \n\nThe Inquisition harassed the Dolcinists until they took refuge in \nthe high mountains. Three crusades were preached against them. In \nthe winter of 1 307 they were finally reduced to starvation, trapped, and \n\n\n\n247 \n\n\n\nDoomsday \n\n\n\nslaughtered. Dolcino was captured alive, unfortunately for him. After \nwatching his Margherita burn, he was torn to pieces by red-hot pincers \non a cart rolling slowly along the roads for all to watch. \n\nDespite this edifying example, Dolcinism persisted for another \ncentury. Two Dolcinist Apostles were captured and burned in \nGermany in 1404. 1 \n\n1. Lea unabridged, 614-23. \n\n\n\nPuranas are ancient \nSanskrit scriptures in \nverse, treating of cos- \nmologies, sacred \nhistories, and the nature \nof the divine. \n\n\n\nDoomsday \n\nThe universal idea of the world\'s end was rooted in ancient Hindu \nbelief in the cyclic alternation of universes, brought about by Kali. \n\nEach successive creation was divided into four yugas or ages: \nSatya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali, the fourth and last marking the age \nwhen Mother turns Destroyer because the race of men become violent \nand sinful, failing to perceive deity in the feminine principle. "Due to \nthe limited intelligence and lust of men in the Kali Yuga, they will be \nunable to recognize women as manifestations of the Shakti." Only a \nfew may escape spiritual degeneration: those who are devoted "to the \nlotus of their mothers\' feet and to their own wives." l \n\nWhen Kali\'s doomsday arrived, the gods would slay each other. \nEarth would be overwhelmed by fire and flood. The Goddess would \nswallow up everything and un-make it, returning to her primordial state \nof formless Chaos, as she was before creation. All beings would enter \nher, because "She devours all existence." 2 After a time that could not \nbe counted because even Time was destroyed, Kali would give birth \nto a new universe. \n\nThe Matsya Purana said signs of approaching doomsday were to \nbe found in the breakdown of social structures, the increase in \nviolence and crime, and the decline of human intelligence: \n\nThere is no one, any more, in whom enlightening goodness (sattva) \nprevails; no real wise man, no saint, no one uttering truth and standing \nby his sacred word. The seemingly holy Brahmin is no better than a fool. \nOld people, destitute of the true wisdom of old age, try to behave like \nthe young, and the young lack the candor of youth. The social classes \nhave lost their distinguishing, dignifying virtues. . . . The will to rise to \nsupreme heights has failed; the bonds of sympathy and love have dis- \nsolved; narrow egotism rules. . . . When this calamity has befallen the \nonce harmoniously ordered City of Man, the substance of the world- \norganism had deteriorated beyond salvage, and the universe is ripe for \ndissolution. } \n\nThe Vishnu Purana said the world in its last days reaches a stage \nwhere "property confers rank, wealth becomes the only source of virtue, \npassion the sole bond of union between husband and wife, falsehood \n\n\n\n248 \n\n\n\nthe source of success in life, sex the only means of enjoyment, and Doomsday \n\nwhen outer trappings are confused with inner religion." 4 \n\nAsiatic arts of astronomic observation and calculation of calendars ^^- B ^^^ \nwere motivated by an earnest desire to know the exact length of each \nyuga, to foresee the end. An age was supposed to begin when sun, \nmoon, and planets stood in conjunction at the initial point of the \necliptic and to end when they returned to the same point. By Hindu \nreckoning, the present yuga began in 3 1 02 B.C. The chronology of \n\'the Central American Maya began in 3 1 1 3 B.C., only 1 1 years later, "a \ndiscrepancy probably due to some minor miscalculation in reckoning \nbackward from the observed movements of the heavenly bodies." 5 \n\nAncient Mesopotamia set the same dates as India and Mexico \nbetween 3113 and 3 1 02 b.c. for the beginning of civilized arts, \nespecially astronomical calculation. The Babylonian sage Berossus said \n"the world will burn when all the planets that now move in different \ncourses come together in the Crab, so that they all stand in a straight \nine in the same sign, and . . . the future flood will take place when \nthe same conjunction occurs in Capricorn. For the former is the \nconstellation of the summer solstice, the latter of the winter solstice; \nthey are the decisive signs of the zodiac, because the turning points of \nthe year lie in them." Jeremias commented: \n\nThis Babylonian doctrine has spread over the whole world. We find it \nagain in Egypt, in the religion of the Avesta, and in India; traces of it \nare discovered in China, as well as in Mexico and among the savage \nnations of South America. To refer these phenomena back to "elemen- \ntary ideas" such as may arise independently among different peoples, will \nnot hold good in view of the circumstance that we have to do with ideas \nconnected with definite facts which rest upon continued astronomical \nobservations. 6 \n\nThese remarks shed light on the great Neolithic monuments \npiown to be astronomical calculators, suggesting a good reason why \nhey were built with so much care and effort. The Stoic philosophers \n)f doomsday drew upon a very ancient tradition in predicting the \nvorld\'s end in terms almost identical with those of Oriental sages: "A \nlew sea will overrun everything, and the Ocean, today the boundary \n.nd girdle of the world, will occupy its centre. . . . What nature has \nnade into separate parts will be confounded into a single mass." This \nreed of dissolution into Chaos became "an important part of \nitoicism." 7 \n\nNorthern Europeans drew their myths of doomsday or Ragnarok \nrom the same ancient tradition. They said the world\'s end would be \nrought about by the Mutspell (Mother\'s Curse) when violent gods \neglected the old laws of peace and blood kinship. The angry \nJoddess would become Skadi the Destroyer, a great shadow devouring \nle world, like her Oriental counterpart Kali. The gods would enter \n\n\n\n249 \n\n\n\nDoomsday that shadow of Gotterdammerung, literally the Going-Into-the-Shadow- \n\nof-the-Gods. They would be consumed, and the heavens and earth \n^^^^^aa^ with them. The world would sink back into the womb of primal chaos \nwhich gave it birth in the beginning. 8 \n\nThis was the prophecy of the sybilline priestess who wrote the \nVoluspa. It was echoed by the Irish sybil Babd, one of the three Fate- \ngoddesses. She foretold the coming of the Waste Land, "trees without \nfruit and seas without fish; old men would give false judgments and \nlegislators make unjust laws; warriors would betray one another, and \nmen would be thieves, and there would be no more virtue left in the \nworld." 9 \n\nAfter destruction of this nonvirtuous world and its cruel gods, there \nwould be a period of dark nonexistence. Then the Goddess\'s womb \nwould bring forth a new universe. A new human race would arise from \na primal couple, a woman named Life one of the Semitic names of \nEve and a man named Desirer-of-Life. 10 \n\nPatriarchal Persians made some alterations in the picture. Their \nidea of doomsday was as dire as any, with the usual convulsions of the \nearth, fires, flood, and fallings of heaven; but they denied the subse- \nquent creation of a new world. Their concept was not cyclic, but \nlinear. Creation and doomsday could occur only once. After the great \nbattle Armageddon at the end of the world, "The War of the Sons of \nLight with the Sons of Darkness," the heavenly forces of the sun god \nwould prevail. 11 They would divide the sinful from the virtuous and \nassign them to heaven or hell. The aftermath was not another creation, j \nbut eternal stasis, like the Brahman Nirvana. \n\nPassing through Jewish-Essenic and Roman-Mithraic sects into \nChristianity, this Persian doomsday became the familiar one in the west \nwith numerous details borrowed from the older Aryan paganism. The \nlast Trump played on Gabriel\'s horn was originally played on Rig- \nHeimdall\'s "ringing horn" (Gjallarhorn). 12 The Great Serpent slain \nby Thor in the final battle became identified with Satan. 13 Like \npaganism\'s sacred dramas, the final drama of the earth\'s dissolution \nwas divided into five acts. 14 Christians even translated the Norse \n"Mother\'s Curse" as "Judgment Day" when they found it variously \nrendered Mutspell, Muspell, Muspelle, Mudspeller, or Muspilli. 15 \n\nThe Savior destined to appear before the world\'s end had an old I \nform in Buddhist scriptures as Kalki Avatara, the Destroyer of Sin, \nwho would come from heaven to announce doomsday. 16 Persians \ncopied him, changing his title to Son of Man, or Messiah. Before 1 70 \nB.C., the Book of Enoch called him Christos, the Anointed One, and \nannounced that he had already come and gone, and that his Second \nComing was expected at any moment. 17 \n\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus identified himself with this person \nage who would be seen "coming in the clouds with great power and \n\n\n\n250 \n\n\n\nglory. And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his Doomsday \n\nelect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the \n\nuttermost part of heaven" (Mark 13:26-27). Jesus was not the only ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nMessiah of his time. Josephus said before 70 a.d. there were countless \n\nMessiahs and Christs announcing the end of the world. 18 \n\nThe Gospels promised doomsday almost at once. Jesus said it \nwould occur in his own generation: "There be some standing here, \nwhich shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God" (Luke \n9:27). Early Christians accordingly expected the world\'s end so soon \nthat there was no reason to marry and beget children who would never \ngrow up, a major reason for Christianity\'s renunciation of marriage. \nMotherhood would only harm women in the convulsions of the last \ndays: "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give \nsuck, in those days!" (Luke 21:23). \n\nHopeful Christians found that Jesus\'s generation and many other \ngenerations passed without apocalyptic symptoms. Seeking an expla- \nnation, theologians discovered the text saying a thousand years were but \na day in the sight of God (Psalms 90:4), another borrowing from \nOriental sages who said a Day of Brahma lasted a thousand years. On \nthe basis of this scripture it was decided that the world would end in \nthe year 1000 a.d. With the approach of that year, Europe was seized \nby an apocalyptic mania. Farms and towns were abandoned as \nfanatics tramped the countryside announcing the Last Days. In some \nareas, agriculture and commerce came virtually to a standstill. The \nyear passed uneventfully enough, but human society suffered greatly \nfrom famines and civil disorders caused by the doomsday belief. 19 \n\nSome Franciscans declared that Christ really had returned to earth \nin 1000 a.d., disguised as St. Francis, the new Messiah, who was \n"entirely transformed into the person of Christ." Francis was said to \nhave performed all the Christ-like miracles, cast out devils, turned \nwater into wine, cured the sick, raised the dead, made the blind see, and \nso on. 20 There were those who went so far as to claim that Christ was \nimportant only as a precursor of St. Francis. 21 \n\nNot only the Christ figure was supposed to return just before \ndoomsday, but also Antichrist, his adversary, for the final battle \nbetween good and evil couldn\'t take place until all the forces were \nassembled on either side. According to a German legend, Antichrist \ncould not come to earth as long as the Holy Roman (German) Empire \nstood. 22 This legend served to keep some of the warring nationlets in \nline at times, but the Holy Roman Empire was a rather loose, indefin- \nable entity for most of its existence. Antichrist was almost as \nconstantly anticipated as Christ. \n\nAnother who taught that the Last Judgment had already taken \nplace was Swedenborg; he gave its date as 1757, the date of the \nestablishment of his own Church of the New Jerusalem. He wisely \n\n\n\n251 \n\n\n\nDoppelganger refrained from predicting the world\'s end a short time in advance, but \n\nDove others fell into this trap, dimming, in England, predicted the end of the \n\n^ wm world in 1867, with resulting injury to his credibility when the end \nfailed to come. \n\nA prominent doomsday prophet was William Miller, inadvertent \nfounder of the sects of Jehovah\'s Witnesses and Seventh-Day Ad- \nventists. He fixed the date of the millenium on March 21, 1843. His \nfollowers were afire with enthusiasm, but still failed to see Christ \ndescending from the clouds as expected. Miller decided he had miscal- \nculated, and fixed a new date on October 21 of the same year. "On \nthe appointed day of doom frenzied believers donned their robes, \ntucked an ultimate lunch in the folds, and took their places on the \nhousetops, facing east. On the 22nd they ate their lunch and climbed \ndown. Miller confessed his disappointment, but insisted \'the day of \nthe Lord is at the door.\' " 23 The Millerites never gave up hope. Their \noffshoot sects still exist and flourish, though naive displays of credulity \nare usually avoided. \n\n1. Mahanirvanatantra, 12, 53, 56, 177. 2. Mahanirvanatantra, 295-96. \n\n3.

Sometimes the afterbirth was said to be an un- \nformed twin of the newborn baby; by magic it might assume the \nliving twin\'s shape and follow him through life. Sometimes this was \nthought to be the Doppelganger seen in one\'s reflection. \n\n\n\nDove \n\nAphrodite\'s totem, the bird of sexual passion, symbolically equivalent \nto the yoni. 1 In India, too, the dove was paravata, the symbol of lust. 2 \nJoined to her consort the phallic serpent, the Dove-goddess stood for \nsexual union and "Life." \n\nThe phrase attributed to Jesus, "Be ye therefore wise as serpents, \nand harmless as doves" (Matthew 10:16), was no random metaphor \nbut a traditional invocation of the Syrian God and Goddess. 3 The \nOriental meaning was remembered by the gypsies, whose folk tales \nsaid the souls of ancestors lived inside magic hollow mountains, the men \nhaving been changed into serpents and the women into doves. 4 \n\n\n\n252 \n\n\n\nChristians adopted the feminine dove as a symbol of the Holy Dove \n\nGhost, originally the Goddess Sophia, representing God\'s "Wisdom" \n\nas the Goddess Metis represented the "Wisdom" of Zeus. Gnostic ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nChristians said Sophia was incarnate in the dove that impregnated the \nvirgin Mary, the same dove that descended on Jesus at his baptism to \nimpregnate his mind (Matthew 3:16). Pious admirers of Pope Greg- \nory the Great made him even more saintly than Jesus by reporting that \nthe Holy Ghost in dove shape descended on him not once but many \ntimes. 5 All this was copied from Roman iconography which showed the \nhuman soul as a dove that descended from the Dove-goddess\'s \noversoul to animate the body. 6 \n\nAphrodite as a bringer of death, or "peace," sometimes bore the \nname of Irene, Dove of Peace. Another of her death-goddess names \nwas Epitymbria, "She of the Tombs." 7 Romans called her Venus \nColumba, Venus-the-Dove. Her catacombs, mausoleums, and ne- \ncropoli were known as columbaria, "dovecotes." 8 Thus the soul \nreturning to the Goddess after death was again envisioned as a dove. \nFrom this image, Christians copied their belief that the souls of saints \nbecame white doves that flew out of their mouths at the moment of \ndeath. In the Catholic ceremony of canonization, white doves are \nreleased from cages at the crucial moment of the ritual. 9 \n\nChristian iconography showed seven rays emanating from the \ndove of the Holy Ghost: an image that went back to some of the most \nprimitive manifestations of the Goddess. 10 In the Orient, the mystic \nseven were the Pleiades or "Seven Sisters," whose Greek name \nmeant "a flock of doves." They were daughters or "rays" of Aphrodite \nunder her title of Pleione, Queen of the Sea. 11 Herodotus said seven \nholy women known as Doves founded the oracles of Dodona, Epirus, \nand Theban Amon. 12 They were worshipped in the Middle East as \nSeven Sages or Seven Pillars of Wisdom: the seven woman-shaped \npillars that had been upholding temples of the Goddess since the \nthird millenium B.C. 13 See Caryatid. Arabs still revere the Seven Sages, \nand some remember that they were women, or "doves." H The \nSemitic word for "dove," ione, was a cognate of "yoni" and related to \nthe Goddess Uni, who later became Iune, or Juno. \n\nThe cult of the Doves used to incorporate primitive rites of \ncastration and its modification, circumcision. India called the seven \nSisters "razors" or "cutters" who judged and "critically" wounded men, \nthe Krittikas, "Seven Mothers of the World," root of the Greek \nkritikos, "judge." They killed and gave rebirth to gods who were \ncastrated to make them fertile, like women. The name of Queen \nSemiramis, legendary founder of Babylon, also meant "Dove" in the \nSyrian tongue. She was said to have castrated all her consorts. 15 \n\nWhen circumcision replaced castration, the doves were involved in \nthat too. Even Christian symbolism made the connection. The \n\n\n\n253 \n\n\n\nDrama official symbol of the Festival of the Circumcision of Christ was a dove, \n\nholding in its beak a ring representing the Holy Prepuce. "Christ\'s \n\n^ HMMHHH i^^^^ M fructifying blood" was linked with the similar emblem of Pentecost, \n\nwhich showed the descending dove on a background of blood red, \n\nofficially described as a representation of the church fertilized by the \n\nblood of Christ and the martyrs. 16 \n\nA certain "maiden martyr" called St. Columba (Holy Dove) was \n\nwidely revered, especially in France, although she never existed as a \n\nhuman being. 17 Another curious survival of pagan dove-lore was the \n\nsurname given to St. Peter: Bar-Iona, "Son of the Dove." 18 Some \n\nsurvivals may have been invented to explain the doves appearing on \n\nancient coins as symbols of Aphrodite and Astarte. 19 \n\n1.

The \naudience participated with songs, dances, sexual orgies, laments, eating \nthe god and rejoicing at his restoration. One object was attainment of \nreligious ecstasy: entering into the "dream." \n\nIt has been shown that every dream bears "a remarkable resem- \nblance to drama." 1 Old Norse draumar, related to German Traum \n(dream), featured a sacrificial slaying of the god, the "tragic" part of the \nperformance. 2 \n\nTragedy descended from the "goat-song" enacting the sacred \ndramas of Dionysus or Pan. The five-act structure of classical tragic \ndrama still seen in the plays of Shakespeare was established by the \nfive-act rites of the god. The acts were: (1) agon, the Contest: the \nincumbent incarnation of the god fought his challenger; (2) pathos, the \nPassion: the god united with the goddess and sent forth his soul with \nhis semen (or blood) to fertilize the world anew he died in his own \nbegetting; (3) threnos, the Lament: a "threnody" of wailings and \ngestures of grief, partly to absolve the audience of responsibility for the \ngod\'s death; (4) anagnorisis, the Discovery: priestesses returned to the \ntomb to find that the god was "risen," in much the same ritual enacted \nby Mary Magdalene and other temple-women at the tomb of Jesus \n(Luke 24:10) where, significantly, no men were present; (5) apotheosis, \nthe Deification: the resurrected victim became God, and rose to \nheaven, to be a part of his divine father. 3 On this occasion the \n\n\n\n254 \n\n\n\nworshippers threw themselves into an orgy of rejoicing, such as Droit du Seigneur \ndistinguished the Roman carnival called Hilaria, "Day of Joy," follow- \ning the death and resurrection of the savior Attis. 4 \n\nDionysus, Pan, Attis, Osiris, Orpheus, and many other gods of the \nmystery-cults contributed their dramas to medieval mystery plays, \ntheir linear descendants. The mummers\' play, the ceremonies of \nCarnival, May Day, Harvest Home and other festivals used parts of \nthe old sacred drama. Characters of the classic commedia were modeled \non some of the pagan deities. The Dove-goddess became Columbine \n(Dove). The Serpent-god became Pierrot (Big Peter, or the Pied One). \nThe name of Harlequin came from the Hellequins, or Hella cunni, \n"kindred of the Goddess Hel," souls of the pagan dead riding forth from \nher underworld. 5 \n\nMasks were customary in the early medieval drama, just as they \nwere in the plays of ancient Greece and Rome. From a magical point \nof view, the essence of the character lay in the mask, not in the actor \nwho wore it. This was the primitive theory behind all appearances of \nmask and costume in religious ceremonies, from the animal-headed \n"gods" of Egypt human bodies wearing the deities\' disguises to \nmodern priestly vestments. Savages still say that, by putting on the mask \nand costume of an animal, spirit, or deity (or all at once), they do not \nsimply make believe but actually become that creature. 6 See Mask. \n\nl.Sagan, 178. 2.

An outgrowth of the feudal system that equated ownership of \nand with ownership of women. The droit du seigneur meant that \nivery serf\'s bride must be deflowered on her wedding night not by her \n>ridegroom but by the lord of the land. \n\nAs laid down by Ewen III of Scotland in the 9th century, the law \naid wives of common folk could be raped by any nobleman at any \nime; and "the lord of the ground shall have the maidenhead of all \nirgins dwelling on the same." \' \n\nThe church upheld the droit du seigneur as a God-given right of \nle nobility. For a vassal bridegroom to consummate his marriage \n/ithin three nights after the wedding was declared blasphemous "to the \n\nbenediction" and tantamount to "carnal lust." 2 The overlord\'s \n\nhowever, was right and proper. The eastern church provided legal \n\nlties for a man who tried to consummate his marriage before his \n\ner could rape the bride.* \n\nDroit du seigneur was a general rule throughout the feudal period \n\ncontinued in Russia up to the 19th century. 4 \n\n\n\n255 \n\n\n\nDruids \n\n\n\nThe system also continued in America\'s slaveholding south before \nthe civil war, unofficially but generally acknowledged. Every black \nwoman was the sexual property of her master, whether she was married \nto another slave or not. 5 Slave marriages could be legally ignored if \nplantation owners cared to do so. In 1757, Peter Fontaine said planta- \ntion owners begot so many children on their female slaves that "the \ncountry swarms with mulatto bastards." Thomas Anburey praised the \nsystem, calling it "a pleasant method to procure slaves at a cheap \nrate." 6 \n\nl.Bullough ( 168. 2.Brasch,74. 3. Briffault 3, 242. 4. Fielding, 155. \n5.

Greek \nmyth said the dryads were oak nymphs, each an oracular priestess with \nher own personal tree spirit, like the biblical Deborah who lived \nunder a tree that bore her own name (Judges 4:5). Dryads were called \npriestesses of Artemis, whose souls dwelt in their trees. They could \nalso assume the shapes of serpents, and were then called Hamadryads, \nor Amadryades. 2 In their druidic groves throughout northern Europe, \nStrabo said, they practiced rites "similar to the orgies of Samothrace."* \n\nDryadism and druidism were two phases of the same religion, \nevidently restricted to a female priesthood in the earlier, matriarchal \nstage, later open to male priests as well. Gaulish and British priests of th< \noak groves formed a class of bardic wizards, keeping a sacred tradition \nby memorizing orally transmitted material, the nucleus of medieval \nsagas, epics, and ballads. \n\nThere is no break between the ancient semi-magical formulae chanted b 4 \nthe Druids and the later incantation of the wizard and the "wise- \nwoman. " They both arose in the Veda-like sacred hymns which formed \nthe depository of the learning professed by the body of the druidical \nteachers and diviners and taught orally in the druidic schools. Most of \nthem were never written down, and the fragments that we possess in \nwriting are probably only the remains of a considerable body of oral \nliterature. 4 \n\nDruids were attacked by the Christian church for their pagan- \nism, but especially for their propensity to include sacred women in their \nranks. Scot said even in his day there were feminine spirits associated \nwith trees, called Dryads in Greece and Druids in Scotland. They were \nshape-shifters, and could appear as either birds or women. "They \nknow our thoughts, and can prophesy of things to come." 5 \n\nDespite nominal conversion to Christianity, the Irish clung to \ndruidism for many centuries. Their revered pagan king Diarmuid was i \n\n\n\n256 \n\n\n\ncalled "half a druid and half a Christian." To make St. Patrick\'s legend Durga \n\nmore palatable to the Irish, monks claimed he had been educated by a \n\ndruid. 6 Irish churches were known by the old druidic name of dairthech, ^^^^^^^^^^ \n"oak-house," formerly applied to the sacred grove. 7 \n\nThe "colleges" of druidesses, or dryads, passed by almost imper- \nceptible degrees into a new designation of Christian nuns. One of the \nthree classes of druidesses consisted of secluded sisterhoods, like the \npriestesses of Brigit, living in convent-like sanctuaries and tending \nsacred fires that were kept perpetually burning. Another, less secluded \nclass of druidesses consisted of married women who lived at the \ntemple and went home occasionally to visit their husbands. A third class \nwas composed of temple servants who lived with their families. 8 With \nthe coming of Christianity, the high holy sisterhoods were assimilated as \nnuns. The others were usually described as witches. \n\nThe druidic religion lasted a surprisingly long time over a surpris- \ningly wide geographical area. Christians continued to worship oak \ndeities in their sacred groves through the 8th century a.d. in Hesse. \nAccording to Gildas, Christian monks copied their tonsure from the \ndruids. Traces of druidism were found as late as 1874 in Russia. 9 Even \nclearer traces were found in the 20th century in the Holy Land, \nwhere the Goddess of the sacred groves was worshipped as Asherah \nsince pre-biblical times, and was known in Canaan as progenitress of \nthe gods. 10 Her priestesses the oak-nymphs continued to be venerated \nunder the title of Benat Ya\'kob (Daughters of Jacob), said to dwell in \ntheir trees near old shrines that were rededicated to mythical Moslem \nsaints. The trees were taboo. Their wood was never taken for fuel, \nexcept for votive purposes. 11 \n\nTo some extent the mystical reverence for oak trees persists to this \nday. Many British and American towns have their venerable "Char- \nter Oak" or some superannuated tree where seasonal ceremonies take \nplace. Acorns and oak leaves are still considered appropriate for \nwreaths and harvest decorations, even if they no longer crown the \n| Goddess\'s sacred kings. \n\n1. Piggott, 105-6. 2. Lawson, 153. 3.

Durga was entitled "The Inaccessible." A crowned \nKmazon, she rode tigers into battle and defeated many demonic \nmonsters, defending her children the gods. 1 Like other forms of the \npoddess-as-warrior, such as the Middle-Eastern Ma-Bellona, Durga \n\n\n\n257 \n\n\n\nDusii drank the blood of her enemies. 2 What this really meant was that her \n\nDymphna, Saint altars or images were anointed with the blood of war captives, killed as \n\n^^g^^^B^ trophies. \n\nAs "The Inaccessible," Durga personified the fighting spirit of a \nmother protecting her young, and perhaps also the nursing mother \nsexually "inaccessible" to men, according to the old Oriental custom. \nDurga stood for the basic animal instincts of maternity, for which the \nadult male is no longer significant, and only her offspring claims a \nmother\'s attention. \n\nDurga was sometimes Shasthi, "the Sixth," Leader of the Moth- \ners. This title arose from the custom of invoking her on the sixth day \nafter childbirth, when the continuous spells for protection of mother and \nchild could be brought to an end. The seventh day was a day of rest. 3 \nThis was the true beginning of the common patriarchal legend of gods \nwho gave birth to the world in six days and rested on the seventh. \nAmong such gods were Persia\'s Ahura Mazda, Memphian Ptah, Babylo- \nnian Marduk, Syrian Baal, and the Hebraic Jehovah. 4 \n\nDurga\'s titles and character penetrated western ideas of the God- \ndess before the first century B.C.

Dympna Dymphna, Saint \n\nA canonization of what seems to have been a bit of graffiti on a brick \nfound near Antwerp in the 1 3th century. The brick was buried near a \ncoffin containing the bones of an unidentified man and woman. The \nwords on the brick were ma dompna, "my lady," the traditional address \nof a medieval poet to his lady-love. \n\nThough having no more basis than these words on an old brick, \n\n\n\n258 \n\n\n\nJk \n\n\n\nthe cult of St. Dymphna was carefully developed. A large asylum \nnear Gheel was named after her, so she became the patron saint of the \ninsane perhaps appropriately. To this day she is still touted as the \nintercessor for people with emotional problems. 1 \n\nl.Attwater, 108. \n\n\n\nDymphna, Saint \n\n\n\n259 \n\n\n\nThe Creation of eve, in \nthe version that says \nshe was made from one \nof Adam\'s ribs. \nFlorentine School. \nWood panel; Fra \nBartolommeo, ca. 1510. \n\neuropa and the Bull, here \nshown on a red-figure \nvase, approximately 1 1 \nby 1 1 inches. Greek, \nca. 490 b.c. \n\n\n\n\nEag\'e Eagle \n\nClassic soul-bird, symbol of apotheosis associated with the sun god, \n^^^^^^^^ fire, and lightning. Greeks thought eagles so closely akin to the lightning \nspirit that they nailed eagles to the peaks of temples to serve as magic \nlightning rods. Hence the name aetoi, "eagles," for the pediments of \nGreek temples. 1 These were ancient forerunners of the "weather- \ncock" on the rooftree of a barn or house. \n\nCults of fire and the sun made the eagle a bearer of kingly spirit: \nthe god\'s soul returning to heaven after a period of earthly incarna- \ntion as the king. 2 It was the Roman custom to release an eagle above the \nfuneral pyre of each emperor, just as an Egyptian pharoah rose to \nheaven on the wings of the solar hawk. 3 \n\nZeus himself took the shape of an eagle to carry his young lover \nGanymede to heaven. This was often interpreted as a symbol of the \nfather-god\'s reception of men\'s souls when they were initiated into the \nsolar Mysteries. 4 \n\nThe eagle was connected with rites of calling down "fire from \nheaven," probably with a burning-glass, to consume sacrifices on the \naltar. Such "fire from heaven" came down from Yahweh to consume \nthe sons of Aaron (Leviticus 10:2), who died like sacrificial victims to \nthe solar gods of Tyre. Such victims "passed through the fire" as \nofferings, and rose to heaven in the form of eagles. \n\nWe must bear in mind that in the East, whence all these beliefs and cults \nderive, not only was fire regarded as an all-powerful purifying agent, \nbut death by fire was looked upon as an apotheosis which raised the victim \nto the rank of the gods. . . . "Fire, "says Iamblichus, "destroys the \nmaterial part of sacrifices, it purifies all things that are brought near it, \nreleasing them from the bonds of matter and, in virtue of the purity of \nits nature, making them meet for communion with the gods. So, too, it \nreleases us from bondage of corruption, it likens us to the gods. 5 \n\nThe eagle was often identified with the fire bird or phoenix, \nwho underwent a baptism of the fire that "burns all sins" and was \nreborn from his own ashes. The eagle also stood for the soul of \nHeracles, who passed through fire into heaven at seasonal festivals of \nTarsus, and inspired St. Paul\'s belief in the virtue of giving one\'s \nbody to be burned (1 Corinthians 13:3). The eagle was the totemic \nform of Prometheus, who "stole" fire from heaven, like the eastern \nfire-lightning-sun hero, man, or angel embodied in the Garuda bird. \nGaruda flew to the mountain of paradise to steal the gods\' secret of \nimmortality. Later, he assumed the golden body of the sun. American \nIndians had a similar hero, the thunderbird or lightning bird. 6 \n\nAs the royal bird of Rome, and the embodiment of deified \nemperors, the eagle was worshipped by Roman legionaries. Each \nlegion had its sacred eagles, carried into battle like banners. If a legion \nshould lose its eagles, the disgrace was unbearable; another whole \nexpedition might be mounted to recover them. 7 \n\n\n\n262 \n\n\n\nThe Roman imperial emblem was inherited by the Germanic E-Anna \n\n"Holy Roman Empire" and its Kaisers, derived from Caesars. Thus Earth \n\nthe eagle became a Teutonic symbol of sovereignty. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nl.Reinach,90. 2. Strong, 182. 3. Campbell, Oc.M., 334. 4. Strong 187 \n5. Strong, 194. 6. Hallet, 376. 7.

Thousands of feminine names have been \ngiven to the earth. Continents Asia, Africa, Europe were named \nafter manifestations of the Goddess. Countries bore the names of \nfemale ancestors or of other manifestations of the Goddess: Libya, \nLydia, Russia, Anatolia, Latium, Holland, China, Ionia, Akkad, \nChaldea, Scotland (Scotia), Ireland (Eriu, Hera) were but a few. 2 Every \nnation gave its own territory the name of its own Mother Earth. \nTacitus said the tribes of Europe regarded Mother Earth as "the all- \nruling deity, to whom all else is subject and obedient." 3 \n\nMother Earth received universal worship because she was the \nuniversal parent. American Indians still relate how all peoples and \nanimals in the beginning emerged from Earth\'s yonic hole, and "it was \njust like a child being born from its mother. The place of emergence \nis the womb of the earth." Siberian reindeer hunters say the human race \nemerged from a Goddess, whose carved figurines protect the hunter\'s \nhut, when given offerings and prayers: "Help us to keep healthy! Help \nus to kill much game!" 4 \n\nThe central doctrine of Amerindian religion was reincarnation in a \nnew body from Mother Earth\'s womb, the ancient meaning of "born \nagain." A chief named Smohalla spoke of his moral obligations formed \nby this doctrine: \n\nIt is a sin to wound or cut, to tear or scratch our common mother by \nworking at agriculture. You ask me to dig in the earth? Am I to take a \nknife and plunge it into the breast of my mother? But then, when I die, \nshe will not gather me again into her bosom. You tell me to dig up and \ntake away the stones. Must I mutilate her flesh so as to get at her bones? \nThen I can never again enter into her body and be born again. 5 \n\nOriental Indians had much the same idea about entering the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n263 \n\n\n\nEarth earth. Hindu priests told a dead man: "Go, seek the earth, that wise and \n\nkind mother of all. O Earth, rise up and do not hurt his bones; be \n\n^^^^^^^^m kind and gentle to him. O Earth, cover him as a mother covers her \ninfant with the skirts of her garment." 6 \n\nAncient Roman philosophers had the same idea too. "The Earth \nMother is the mysterious power that awakes everything to life. ... All \ncomes from the earth and all ends in the earth ... the earth produces all \nthings and then enfolds them again . . . the Goddess is the beginning \nand end of all life." A Roman writer of the 3rd century a.d. prayed to \n"Holy Goddess Earth, Nature\'s mother, who bringeth all to life, and \nrevives all from day to day. The food of life Thou grantest in eternal \nfidelity. And when the soul hath retired we take refuge in Thee. All \nthat Thou grantest falls back somewhere into Thy womb." 7 \n\nPatriarchal Christians might have been expected to speak of Father \nHeaven rather than Mother Earth, yet even they found it impossible \nto give up the older deity. The epitaph of Pope Gregory the Great said: \nSuscipe Terra tuo de corpore sumptum: "Receive, O Earth, what \nwas taken from thy body." 8 Even up to the 20th century, tombstones of \nGerman Christians bore the formula: Hier ruht im Mutterschoss der \nErde . . . , "Here rests in Earth\'s maternal womb. . . ." 9 In Chaucer\'s \nPardoner\'s Tale an old man pleaded with the Goddess: \n\n. . . / walk alone and wait \nAbout the earth, which is my mother\'s gate, \nKnock-knocking with my staff from night to noon \nAnd crying, "Mother, open to me soon! \nLook at me, Mother, won \'tyou Jet me in? \nSee how I wither, flesh and bones and skin! \nAlas! When will these bones be laid to rest?" 10 \n\nThis was more than a poetic metaphor. As late as the 1 2th \ncentury, many Europeans still recognized Mother Earth as a Goddess, \nperhaps their only supreme divinity. She was described in an English \nherbal of the period with no mention of God at all: \n\nEarth, divine goddess, Mother Nature, who dost generate all things and \nbringest forth ever anew the sun which thou hast given to the nations; \nGuardian of sky and sea and of all Gods and powers; through thy \ninfluence all nature is hushed and sinks to sleep. . . . Again, when it \npleases thee, thou sendest forth the glad daylight and nurturest life with \nthine eternal surety; and when the spirit of man passes, to thee it \nreturns. Thou art indeed rightly named Great Mother of the Gods; \nVictory is thy divine name. Thou art the source of the strength of \npeoples and gods; without thee nothing can either be born or made \nperfect; thou art mighty, Queen of the Gods. Goddess, I adore thee as \ndivine, I invoke thy name; vouchsafe to grant that which I ask of thee, so \nshall I return thanks to thy godhead. " \n\nUp to the Renaissance, English farmers continued to call upon \nErce, eorthan modor (Earth, mother of earth) when planting. 12 Similar- \n\n\n\n264 \n\n\n\nly, up to the 20th century, Russian farmers continued to call upon Earth \n\nMati-Syra-Zemlya (Moist Mother Earth) for almost everything. Instead \n\nof touching a Bible when taking an oath, a Russian peasant would put ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\na clod of earth on his head, invoking the Mother\'s curse if he broke his \nword. 13 This perpetuated an ancient Greek habit. Even the patriar- \nchal Olympian gods swore their binding oaths by Mother Earth: Gaea, \nor Rhea, called Universal Mother, Deep-Breasted One, firmly \nfounded, oldest of divinities. 13 Hesiod admitted that she ruled Olympus \nbefore the coming of the Hellenic deities. She ruled Russia too. The \ncountry bore her ancient name, Rha (Rhea), the Red One, mother of \nthe Volga and all its tribes. 14 \n\nHome and Mother were literally identical to people who combined \nboth in their image of the earth-goddess. Many believed they must be \nburied in the same soil that supported them in childhood. Threatened \nby invaders, the matriarchal Cimmerians could have saved them- \nselves by moving away from their homeland; but they chose to face \nsuperior numbers of enemies, and die where they were, believing \ntheir lives valueless if they couldn\'t re-unite with the same Earth that \ngave them birth. 15 The Egyptian traveler Sinuhe felt the approach of \ndeath and hurried home to his motherland "to follow the Lady of All," \nhoping that she would "spend eternity by my side." 16 \n\nPost-mortem reunion with the Mother always overlapped with \nthe idea of marrying her. Man seldom distinguished clearly between his \nthree roles as the Goddess\'s child, corpse, and bridegroom. Balkan \npeasants still view death as a sacred marriage, and dress corpses as for a \nwedding. Formal dirges say: "The black earth for my wife I took." \nAncient Greek epitaphs similarly proclaimed the dead man "admitted to \nthe bridal chamber of Persephone." Artemidorus wrote: "All the \naccompaniments of marriage are exactly the same as those of death." 17 \n\nThe archetypal image of the marriage-with-Earth had a curious \nrevival in the special mid- Victorian pornography known as pornoto- \npia, in which the female body was a landscape, and man \ncorrespondingly reduced in fantasy to about the size of a fly: \n\nIn the middle distance there looms a large irregular shape. On the horizon \nswell two immense snowy white hillocks; these are capped by great, \npink, and as it were prehensile peaks or tips as if the rosy-fingered dawn \nitself were playing just behind them. The landscape undulates gently \ndown to a broad, smooth, swelling plain, its soft rolling curves broken only \nin the lower center by a small volcanic crater or omphalos. Farther \ndown, the scene narrows and changes in perspective. Off to the right and \nleft jut two smooth snowy ridges. Between them, at their point of \njuncture, is a dark wood . . . sometimes it is called a thicket . . . triangular \nin shape. It is also like a cedarn cover, and in its midst is a dark romantic \nchasm. In this chasm the wonders of nature abound. From its top there \ndepends a large, pink stalactite, which changes shape, size, and color in \naccord with the movement of the tides below and within. Within the \nchasm which is roughly pear-shaped there are caverns measureless \n\n\n\n265 \n\n\n\nEarth to man, grottoes, hermits\' caves, underground streams a whole internal \n\nand subterranean landscape. The climate is warm but wet. Thunder- \n\n^^__^^___^^^^_ storms are frequent in this region, as are tremors and quakings of the \n\nearth. The walls of the cavern often heave and contract in rhythmic \nviolence, and when they do the salty streams that run through it double \ntheir flow. The whole place is dark yet visible.
