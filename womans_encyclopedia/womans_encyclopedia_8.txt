The riddle was: "What goes on \nfour legs at dawn, two legs at midday, and three legs at sunset, and is \nweakest when it has the most support?" The answer was either man \nor god. The sun god Ra, Hathor\'s offspring, grew old and feeble at the \nend of each day and walked with a third leg: a cane. 1 Some said Ra\'s \nweakness was the result of his mother\'s curse. \n\nAs the two-faced Goddess of birth and death, the Sphinx some- \ntimes looked in two directions, with two heads and two foreparts. \nThis glyph was called xerefu and akeru, "the Lions of Yesterday and \nToday," similar to the Goddess\'s Greek designation of Alpha and \nOmega. 2 \n\n1.

The classic myth \nof Athene\'s jealousy of the maiden Arachne, which caused her to \nturn Arachne into a spider who continued to practice her incomparable \nskill in spinning and weaving, was mistakenly deduced from an icon \nshowning Athene with her totemic spider spinning the web of Fate, \nfrom which the future could be foretold. An English writer of the \n17th century still thought "Minerva" (Athene) gave spiders a special \nability to foretell the weather. 1 \n\nIn Hindu myth, the spider represented Maya, virgin aspect of the \nTriple Goddess, spinner of magic, fate, and earthly appearances. 2 \nThe spider\'s web was likened to the Wheel of Fate and the spider to the \nGoddess as a spinner, sitting at the hub of her wheel. \n\n\n\n957 \n\n\n\nstarted \nSlHU Maris \n\n\n\nThe female spider\'s habit of devouring her mate led to identifica- \ntion of the spider with the death goddess, Maya transformed into \nKali-Uma In Aztec myth, with its mysterious archaic relation to India, \nspiders represented the souls of warrior women from the pre-Aztec \nmatriarchate, like the Amazonian Fate-spinners. At the end of the \nworld these women would descend from heaven on their silken \nthreads and eat up all the men on earth, like eight-legged Valkyries. \nIndeed there were Scandinavian associations, too. Odin\'s horse \nSleipnir (Slippery) was gray and had eight legs, like a spider; it also \nrepresented Odin\'s "Fate" in that it was associated with the gallows \non which he was hanged. _ \n\nMedieval Europe usually associated spiders with witches. The folk \ntale of the Spider and the Fly suggested the once widespread belief \nthat flies are souls in search of a female entity to eat them and give them \nrebirth.\' See Arachne. \n\n1.

Thor tore off all but two of \nStarkad\'s arms to "make him more comely," but his body always bore \nthe marks of former supernumerary limbs. He was one of the elder \ngods or giants named risi, a derivation from Sanskrit rishi, "a sage"; \ntherefore he was obviously a Hindu idol of the many-armed type still \nseen in India. 1 His myth indicates the Asiatic origin of northern Aryan \npeoples. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 206.2?!. \n\n\n\nStations of the Cross \n\nImage-galleries picturing key events in Christ\'s life and martydom, \nwith recommended prayers and meditations for each stop. The gallery \nof "stations " was based on ancient Oriental picture galleries within \nthe temple, to be traversed by pilgrims enroute to the central Holy of \nHolies. 1 The idea of separate, progressive meditations was taken \ndirectly from the Oriental tradition, in which the pilgrim\'s mind was \nsupposed to be prepared for the inner revelation by slow stages during \nprogress through the gallery or labyrinth. \n\n1 .

St. Jerome was said to have been the first to \nsteal the title from the old Goddesses and bestow it on Mary. 1 The \n"star" was variously identified as the planet Venus (morning and \n\n\n\n<>SS \n\n\n\nevening star), or Polaris marking the axis mundi, or Sirius, or the Stoicism \n\nleader of the Pleiades. Styx \n\nl.Jobes,350. ^^^^^^^^^^m \n\n\n\nStoicism \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreco- Roman school of philosophy based on worship of Fate, the \nGoddess whose law ruled the constant combining, dissolving, and re- \ncombining of elements (stoicheia). The infinite variety of her \nmanipulations of elemental ingredients "gave rise to all perceptible \nphenomena." 1 \n\nAccording to Stoic doctrine, the karmic law of Nature was beyond \nthe power of any god to rescind, for the gods themselves were subject \nto the same law, and in common with other creatures would be \ndestroyed eventually. Thus Stoicism stood in opposition to the Judeo- \nChristian hypothesis of miracles, by which God broke his own laws from \ntime to time. Stoics said whatever is, is natural. \n\nThe Stoic concept of Fate or Nemesis was like the Tantric \nconcept of Kali. To know the Goddess was to accept the fact of \ndeath, and to bow before the decrees of Fate as gracefully as possible. \n\nStoicism appealed to Roman intellectuals such as Seneca and \nLucretius, who despised religious commercialism and hypocrisy. The \nStoic sage Persius seems to have been a model for the story of Christ\'s \nencounter with the money-changers in the temple. It was Persius the \nStoic who first demanded, "What is gold doing in a holy place?" 2 \n\nEarly Christians envied the esthetic elegance of Stoic theology and \ntried to assimilate it, but the basic premises of Stoicism and Christian- \nity couldn\'t be reconciled. "The difference between the two \nconceptions cannot fail to manifest itself. . . . Stoic ethics are self- \nsufficing; they proceed from nature, so to speak, and do not rely upon \ngrace; they have no need of a doctrine of Redemption. . . . There is \nnothing in common between them and Christianity save the elements it \nonce borrowed from them."* \n\nNevertheless, Christian admirers of Stoicism strove to assimilate \nStoic principles, such as the brotherhood of man, which Christian \nGospels did not teach. St. Augustine even borrowed the phrase coined \nby Marcus Aurelius in his Stoic vision of all races dwelling as kindred \nin the "City of Zeus," though Augustine revised the title to "City of \nGod."* \n\n1 .

"He" was called a protector of the sun, yet \n"he" always appeared in the garments of a Chinese woman, indicat- \ning an origin both feminine and rooted in lands west of Japan. 6 \n\n\' Among the ancient Arabs, the sun was a Goddess, Atthar, some- \ntimes called Torch of the Gods. 7 The Celts had a Sun Goddess \nnamed Sulis, from sail, meaning both "eye" and "sun." Germans called \nher Sunna. Norwegians called her Sol. 8 In Scandinavia she was also \nknown as Glory-of-Elves, the Goddess who would give birth to a \ndaughter after doomsday, thus producing the new sun of the next \ncreation. 9 The Eddas said: "One beaming daughter the bright Sun \nbears before she is swallowed by Fenrir; so shall the maid pace her \nmother\'s way when the gods have gone to their doom." 10 \n\nThe Sun Goddess Sul, Sol, or Sulis was worshipped in Britain at \nthe famous artificial mountain in the Avebury complex of megalithic \nmonuments, now known as Silbury Hill. Here she gave birth to each \nnew Aeon from her great belly-tumulus, over 1 30 feet high and more \nthan 500 feet in diameter. "The influence of the British Goddess, Sul, \nextended over the greater part of south west England, and her \nworship appears to have been conducted on the tops of hills, overlook- \ning springs. Thus near her springs at Bath we have the isolated hill \ncalled Solsbury, or Sulisbury, probably the seat of her worship." At \nBath, Romans identified Sul with Minerva and set up altars to her \nunder the name of Sul Minerva. 11 \n\n1. Larousse, 408 etseq. 2. Campbell, Or.M., 463. 3. O\'Flaherty, 339. \n\n4.

She chose Shiva the Condemned One \nas her consort, casting over his head a wreath of flowers representing \nher yoni enveloping his lingam. In the role of sacred king he would die \nin his mating, like a penis, and his bridal wreath became the funeral \nwreath laid on his grave. 1 His divine bride followed him into the \nunderworld and brought him back, as Ishtar followed Tammuz and \nAphrodite followed Adonis. 2 \n\nSvayamara meant a love-death (Teutonic Liebestod), a sinister \nimplication for the ones who originally "caught the bride\'s bouquet." \nBut later patriarchy converted the spirit of Sati into a symbol of the \ndutiful wife who followed her deceased husband into the underworld, \nwhether she wanted to or not. "Sati" was corrupted into the word for \nwidow-sacrifice, suttee. Up to the 19th century it was customary to \nburn widows on their husbands\' funeral pyres, until the British govern- \nment in India finally classified the rite of suttee as "homicide" \nthough it was never homicide, but only gynocide. 3 Widowers were \nnever slain for the sake of their dead wives. \n\n1.

Like European bards and minnesingers \nwho copied them, medieval Sufi poets sang of the spiritual signifi- \ncance of love, exemplified in the woman called a Fravashi or "Spirit of \nthe Way." Sufis claimed the universe was held together by the \nfeminine forces of motherhood and sexuality. To survive within a \nrabidly patriarchal society, however, the Sufis disguised their doc- \ntrines in many allegorical symbols, and established a mystical system in \nwhich nearly every tenet was imparted as a graphic image or \nmetaphorical tale. Sir Richard Burton called Sufism "the Eastern parent \nof Freemasonry."

See Birth-Giving, Male. \n\nl.OTlaherty.354. \n\n\n\nSufism \nSun Goddess \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSun Goddess \n\nThough western iconography usually called the sun male and the \nmoon female, archaic Oriental tradition spoke of a female sun. Japanese \nruling clans traced their descent from a supreme Sun Goddess, \nOmikami Amaterasu. 1 In 238 a.d., Japanese tribes were ruled by a \nqueen named Himiko, Daughter of the Sun. 2 \n\nThe Hindu Great Mother took the form of the sun as the Goddess \nAditi, mother of the twelve zodiacal Adityas, spirits who would \n"reveal their light at Doomsday." 3 The Mahanirvanatantra said the sun \nwas the "garment" of the Great Goddess: "The sun, the most \nglorious symbol in the physical world, is the mayik vesture of Her who is \n\'clothed with the sun.\' " 4 The same Goddess, identified with Mary, \nappeared in the Gospels as the "woman clothed with the sun" (Revela- \ntion 12:1). \n\nTantric Buddhism recognized a precursor of the Middle-Eastern \nMari, or Mary, as the sun. Her monks greeted her at dawn as "the \nglorious one, the sun of happiness. ... I salute you, O Goddess Marici! \nBless me, and fulfil my desires. Protect me, O Goddess, from all the \neight fears." 5 \n\nWhen the Japanese revised their mythology to accommodate new \npatriarchal ideas, the Goddess Marici was masculinized, and it was \nforgotten that she was once identical with Omikami Amaterasu. Yet \nthere was a strange ambivalence about the "powerful god" called \n\n\n\n\nSun Goddess \n\n\n\n961 \n\n\n\nSwHtfla \n\n\n\non it; so, sorrowfully revealing his name, Lohengrin was obliged to leave \nElse and return to the Mount of Paradise. Other versions of the story \nsaid he took her with him to Montsalvatch, where they lived happily \n\never after. 8 \n\nOther stories said Lohengrin appeared in his swan-feather costume \nto defend Clarissa, Duchess of Bouillon, against the Count of \nFrankfort, who tried to steal her duchy. Or, he took up the cause of \nBeatrice of Cleves, whose property rights were threatened by hostile \nbarons. 9 Though he sallied forth to the rescue of several ladies in \ndistress, the Swan-knight\'s real home was always "the mountain \nwhere Venus lives in the Grail." 10 \n\n1 Baring-Gould, C.M.M.A., 568. 2.

Swastikas appear on Paleo- \nlithic carvings on mammoth ivory from the Ukraine, dated ca. 10,000 \nB.C. 1 Swastikas figure on the oldest coinage in India. 2 Persia, Asia \nMinor, and Greece represented the rotating axis mundi with the symbol \nof a swastika. On a Boeotian amphora of the 7th century B.C., the \nswastika was presented as a sacred sign of the Goddess Artemis. 3 It also \nrepresented many other deities from Iceland to Japan, Scandinavia to \nNorth Africa. It was much used in Troy and Mycenae before the 1 3 th \ncentury B.C. 4 \n\nSanskrit svastika meant "so be it" or "amen." In Japan, the swas- \ntika was an ideogram for "infinity" the number 10,000, which was \na synonym for infinity because it was the highest number Japanese sages \ncould visualize. 5 \n\nThere were two basic types of swastikas: the left-pointing, counter- \nclockwise, widdershins version called the Moon Swastika, and the \nright-pointing, clockwise one called the Sun Swastika. The former was \nnaturally associated with the Left-Hand Path of the Goddess, the \nlatter with the Right-Hand Path of the God. (See Left Hand.) Hindus \nsaid the solar swastika represented the god Ganesha, "Lord of Hosts," \nand the lunar swastika stood for Kali-Maya, his virgin bride, mother of \nBuddha. 6 As a reincarnation of his divine father, Buddha displayed \nthe sign of a cross, with a swastika enclosed in the female circle at the \nend of each arm. 7 Tibetan Buddhists said the right-handed swastika \nwas the Savior, the left-handed swastika meant witchcraft, or the \n"magic" of Mother Maya. 8 \n\nThe feminine moon swastika received the name oisauvastika and \nwas said to represent the autumnal half of the year, when the sun \n\n\n\nm \n\n\n\nwanes, while the masculine swastika stood for the vernal season when Swithin, Saint \n\nthe sun grows stronger. 9 As the feminine sauvastika suggested the sun \n\ngod declining toward his death and resurrection at the winter solstice, it mm^^mtm^^^^mm \nsometimes signified rebirth. \n\nIn Japan, the reborn Amida, "Buddha of Immeasurable Light," \nwore a left-handed swastika carved on his breast. 10 A similar left- \nhanded swastika was the sign of Thor\'s hammer on Scandinavian \ncoins. 11 Thor was one of the gods supposed to have come from \nancient Troy; and Trojan images of the Great Goddess showed a \nswastika within a female triangle on her belly, indicating the hidden \ngod prior to his next rebirth. 12 \n\nEarly Christians adopted the swastika to represent Christ, calling it \na crux dissimulata or disguised cross. It was also called crux gammata, \ngammadion, or gamma cross, because it showed the Greek letter \ngamma four times repeated. To Saxons it was fylfot, translated either \n"four-foot," referring to the four heavenly pillars at the corners of the \nearth, or "fill-foot," referring to the Christian habit of filling in the \nfoot of a church window with swastikas. 13 In old Danish churches, the \nswastika was the usual ornamentation for the baptismal font. 14 It was \nalso much used in medieval heraldry, as "cross potent rebated," croix \ngammee, or croix cramponnee. Still, knights who wore the swastika \non their shields couldn\'t be sure whether it stood for the cross of Christ \nor the cross of Thor, the latter being revered in swastika form all over \nGermanic areas, including the Scandinavian settlements in Lincolnshire \nand Yorkshire. 15 \n\nIn the 1930s, the Nazi party adopted the swastika because of an \nimpression that it was a "pure Aryan" sign. A variant of the swastika \nlong represented German Vehmic Courts (from Vehme, "punish- \nment") which began in the Middle Ages as civil tribunals for \npersecuting heretics, and became connected with the Inquisition. Their \nactivities were kept secret. In Napoleon\'s time, the Vehmic Courts \nwere still operating as underground organizations devoted to summary \njustice, like the Black Hand in Sicily. 16 From the Vehmgericht arose \nspecifically anti-Semitic secret societies of Austria and Germany in the \nearly 1900s the forerunners of Nazism. \n\n1.

Budge, E.L., 76. \n\n\n\nTammuz \n\nThe Christos or sacred king annually sacrificed in the temple at \nJerusalem, attended by women who dedicated him to their Goddess \nIshtar-Mari, Queen of Heaven, his mother and bride (Ezekiel 8:14). \nHe was a Hebrew version of Dionysus Liber, or Adonis, whom the \n\n\n\n970 \n\n\n\nRomans called the chief god of the Jews. l Tacitus however thought Tammuz \n\nthe Jews had given up worshipping Liber, for he "established a festive \n\nand cheerful worship, while the Jewish religion is tasteless and ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmean." 2 A month of the Jewish calendar is still named after Tammuz, \n\nwho was revered all the way up to the 10th century. 5 \n\nTammuz was imported from Babylon by the Jews, but he was \neven older than Babylon. He began as the Sumerian savior-god \nDumuzi, or Damu, "only-begotten Son," or "Son of the Blood." He \nfertilized the earth with his blood at the time of his death, and was \ncalled Healer, Savior, Heavenly Shepherd. He tended the flocks of stars, \nwhich were considered souls of the dead in heaven. Each year on the \nDay of Atonement he was sacrificed in the form of a lamb, son of the \nHoly Ewe; but his animal incarnation was understood to be a \nsubstitute for an earlier human sacrifice. A lament for the dead god \nasked rhetorically: \n\nWhy have they slain him, him of the plains? The Shepherd, the Man of \nWisdom, the Man of Sorrow why have they slain? The Lady of the \nVine languishes, the lambs and the calves languish. The Lord, the \nShepherd of the fold lives no more, the spouse of the Queen of \nHeaven lives no more. * \n\nOn the occasion of the god\'s death, temple women raised ritual \n"howls" or "ululations," which the Babylonians called alalu, and the \nGreeks called houloi. This was the sound mentioned by Ezekiel: in \nthe Jerusalem temple, women "wailed" for Tammuz. A typical "wail" \nis mentioned in Sumerian scriptures: \n\nFor him who has been taken away there is wailing; ah me, my child has \nbeen taken away, my Damu that has been taken away, my Christ that \nhas been taken away, from the sacred cedar where the Mother bore him. \nThe wailing is for the plants, they grow not; for the houses and for the \nHocks, they produce not; for the perishing wedded couples, for perishing \nchildren, the people of Sumer, they produce not. The wailing is for the \ngreat river, it brings the Hood no more. The wailing is for the fish ponds; \nthe fish spawn not. The wailing is for the forests; the tamarisks grow \nnot. The wailing is for the store-house; the honey and wine are not \nproduced. y \n\nSome liturgies addressed Dumuzi-Tammuz as Usir or Usirsir, \nvariations of the name Osiris, who was also the Good Shepherd and the \nkeeper of the "flocks" of the dead. 6 Though Tammuz occupied the \ncentral position in the sacred drama at Jerusalem, the New Testament \ntransformed him into a mere apostle of the new dying god, under the \nGreek form of his name, Thomas. \n\nA thousand years later, however, Syrian farmers still considered the \nsacrifice of Ta-uz, the grain god, essential to the welfare of the crops. \nHe was cruelly treated: slain by the reaper\'s sickle, his bones ground in a \nmill, his flesh scattered on the earth, his death bewailed by the \nwomen. 7 \n\n\n\n971 \n\n\n\nlanit \nTannhauser \n\n\n\nLike all earlier "saviors," Tammuz eventually was diabolized in \nChristian tradition. During the Middle Ages he was listed as one of \nhell\'s leading devils. Weyer\'s treatise on demonology made Tammuz \nhell\'s ambassador to Spain, probably because he was still worshipped \nby Saracenic sects in Spain. 8 \n\n1 Graves W.G. 368. 2. Tacitus, 660. 3.

See Sybil. \n\n\n\n972 \n\n\n\nTantrism Tantrism \n\nThe system of yoni-worship, or female-centered sex-worship, alleged- \nly founded thousands of years ago in India by women of a secret sect hhuhmhihi \ncalled Vratyas, forerunners of the devadasis or sacred harlots. 1 The \nreligion was associated with later written scriptures known as Tantras, \ntherefore it was called Tantrism. The primary object of its adoration \nwas the lingam-yoni, sign of male and female principles in conjunction \n(the god Shiva and the goddess Shakti-Kali). Tantrism is still widely \npracticed in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. 2 \n\nThe basic principle of Tantrism was that women possess more \nspiritual energy than men, and a man could achieve realization of the \ndivinity only through sexual and emotional union with a woman. A \nfundamental rite was controlled sexual intercourse, maithuna, Latin \ncoitus reservatus: sex without male orgasm. The theory was that a man \nmust store up his vital fluids rather than expending them in ejacula- \ntion. Through Tantric training, he learned to absorb through his penis \nthe fluid engendered by his partner\'s orgasm and to prolong sexual \nintercourse for many hours. In this way he could become like Shiva, the \nGod in perpetual union with his Goddess. Theoretically, the vital \nfluids thus conserved would be stored in a man\'s spinal column, mount \nthrough the chakras up to his head, and there flower forth with the \ninspiration of divine wisdom. The Tantras explain this and other \npractices based on worship of the Goddess, together with the philoso- \nphy underlying the rites. \n\nThe most sacred mantra (holy phrase) expressing Tantric worship \nwas Om manipadme hum, the Jewel (penis) in the Lotus (vulva). \nThe symbolic lingam-yoni often took the form of an altar, shaped like a \npenis in a vulva. 3 Remnants of Tantric practice inspired the medieval \nEuropean belief that "witches" worshipped at an altar represented by a \nfemale body. \n\nTantric Buddhism consisted of an uneasy marriage between an \noriginally ascetic Buddhist cult with ancient sexual disciplines. Like its \nChristian offshoot five centuries later, Buddhism was founded on \nopposition to the female principle and the belief that men must avoid \nwomen, in order to conserve their souls\' vitality by retaining their semen \nand concentrating on the Self. Buddhist monks claimed their prophet \nordered them to quell all sexual desire, and never to see or speak to \nwomen. 4 \n\nLike early Christianity, however, Buddhism soon spread out \nalong a continuum of sects ranging from the austere, puritanical Jains to \nexuberantly erotic Tantric Buddhists with principles like "Buddha- \nhood resides in the vulva." 5 All over Indian temples, Buddhist saints \nappeared with their voluptuous Shaktis in the divine embrace called \nYab-Yum (Father-Mother), representing everlasting orgasmic bliss \nthe real cause of the beatific smiles on the faces of the bodhisattvas. \n\nErotic forms of Tantric Buddhism penetrated all Asia, though \npatriarchal sects later suppressed them and denied their historical \n\n\n\n973 \n\n\n\nTantrism \n\n\n\nexistence. Tantric Buddhism flourished in China under the Six Dynas- \nties, T\'ang, and Mongol Yuan, until Confucian patriarchs succeeded \nin eliminating it. Japanese Shingon is an attenuated remnant. Tantrism \nis no longer mentioned in China or Japan; its art was destroyed; \nauthorities pretend it was never there at all. 6 \n\nThe same denial appeared in areas dominated by Islam where Sufi \nmystics had perpetuated a form of Tantrism. They emphasized the \ndiscipline oifana, "rapture," attainable only with a pir (Peri), a fairy \nmistress, also known as Fravashi, "Spirit of the Way." 7 Through her, \na man might achieve "the larger full surrender" said to pass beyond \nGod to realization of the ultimate Void that swallowed even the \ngods. 8 \n\nEarly Gnostic Christians sometimes called their religion synesak- \ntism, the Way of Shakti, another name for Tantrism. 9 These \nChristians were influenced by Oriental Tantrism as well as by some of \nits western forms, philosophies of Goddess-worship filtered through \nPythagorean and Neoplatonic mystics. Plotinus equated the mind\'s \nprogress toward the Ineffable with "the sight of a beautiful lady." \nAscent of the mind toward realization of divinity was divided into six \nsteps, beginning with perception of woman\'s beauty, culminating in \ncontemplation of Universal Beauty. 10 \n\nChristians like the Ophites and Montanists apparently practiced \nsexual adoration of the feminine life force under the name of Sophia, \nthe female Holy Spirit, a feminine soul or Shakti of God. Their rite of \n"spiritual marriage" was misunderstood by the orthodox, who later \ncalled it a Test of Faith. Certain male and female saints, they said, had \nproved their chastity by lying together naked without copulation. \nPossibly it was not sexual intercourse perse that such "saints" had \navoided, but only male orgasm. Like Tantric yogis, Gnostic saints \nsometimes thought themselves "perfected" by coitus reservatus, so they \ncould indulge in nakedness and promiscuity without being sinful. 11 \n\nThese sects were destroyed by the end of the 5 th century a.d. and \nno more was heard of the famous Test of Faith. 12 Orthodox fathers \nof the church ruled that sexual intercourse should have no purpose \nother than to beget offspring, and sexual pleasure should be altogeth- \ner denied to women. 13 \n\nWhile Tantric Christians were condemned as heretics, Islamic \nleaders were attacking Sufi cults of love. 14 Sufi mysticism survived \nunderground, in the hands of troubadours who called themselves \nLovers and adored the female principle as the world-sustaining \npower. Sufi yoni-worship influenced European troubadours, who \nfounded cults of Courtly Love in the centuries following the cru- \nsades. The church called them devil-worshippers because they \n"sinfully" loved women instead of God, and women were equated \nwith the devil by the theological opinion of the time. 15 See Romance. \n\nHeroes of the Courtly Love movement apparently practiced \nTantric maithuna under the name of drudaria, a kind of love \n\n\n\n974 \n\n\n\nassociated with male self-denial, yet not at all chaste. On the contrary, its Tao \n\npoetry was highly erotic. 16 Bardic romance sometimes showed dis- \ntinct connections with eastern Tantrism, as when Peredur\'s mystic ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nlady-love revealed that she came from India, or when Tristan told his \nlady-love Iseult that his name was the syllabically-reversed Tantris. 17 \n\nThough never officially recognized, Tantric sex has been practiced \nthroughout history in western nations, either in accordance with a \nsecret teaching, or as an independent discovery. Medieval Goddess- \nworshippers vilified as "witches" apparently knew of it, and may have \nused it as a birth-control technique. It was claimed that no woman was \never made pregnant at the witches\' Sabbath. 18 \n\nIn 1848, maithuna was again publicized by the founder of the \nOneida Creek Community, John Humphrey Noyes, who rediscov- \nered it while trying to protect his wife from "the horrors and the fear of \ninvoluntary propagation" after she had four disastrous pregnancies. 19 \nNoyes called his discovery "male continence," or karezza, and trained \nmembers of his community in the technique. Then they engaged in \nwhat Noyes called "complex marriage" with various partners, without \nunwanted pregnancies. 20 Several occult societies of the 19th and \n20th centuries made use of Tantric coitus reservatus for various reasons, \nbut it was seldom admitted to the "normal" sexual repertoire of the \nwestern male. \n\n1 .

Men were taught to \nreserve their vital forces, which could be dangerously depleted by \nejaculation, and to let their weaker Yang nature absorb the powerful \nYin force engendered by a woman\'s orgasm. Men were advised to keep \nthis "key" secret from women, for if women learned to suppress their \nown orgasms while bringing men to ecstasy, they would greatly surpass \nmen in wisdom and spiritual energy.

Like Jupiter \nPluvius, he fertilized Mother Tara with rain. 4 The traditional words \nof a fanfare, Taran-Tara, originally came from a magic "cry" expressing \nthe union of the two deities. \n\nTantric Buddhists in Tibet still pray to Mother Tara like this: \n\nHail! O verdant Tara! The Savior of all beings! Descend, we pray Thee, \nfrom Thy heavenly mansion, at Potala, together with all Thy retinue of \ngods, titans, and deliverers! We humbly prostrate ourselves at Thy lotus- \nfeet! Deliver us from all distress! O holy Mother! We hail Thee! O \nrevered and sublime Tara! Who are adored by all the kings and princes of \nthe ten directions and of the present, past and future. ! \n\nIn India, Tara is called "the most revered" of the old pre-Vedic \nGoddesses, just as in all lands populated by Aryan peoples, Mother \nEarth was the first, oldest, and greatest of deities. 6 \n\nl.Dumezil,676. 2.

In addition to the now-standard 52 four \nsuits from ace to king Tarot packs had a fifth suit, the Major Arcana \n(Great Secrets), a trump suit consisting of 22 picture cards. Only one of \nthese trump cards now remains in the deck, the Joker, Jester, or Fool. \nPresent card decks are only remnants of what medieval cards used to \nbe that is, the Tarot. \n\nFour court cards also disappeared from the suits: the four knights. \nTherefore, modern cards have only three court cards per suit: king, \nqueen, and jack. Disappearance of the knights led some scholars to \nthink Tarot cards might have been invented by the Knights Templar, \nwho were declared heretics, disgraced, and exterminated in the 14th \ncentury. Though Templars may have learned from the Saracens to \nuse cards, they didn\'t invent them. 1 Unbound "books" of picture cards \nwere long used in the east to teach mystical doctrines to people who \ncouldn\'t read. 2 \n\nItalian author Covelluzo wrote: "In the year 1379 the game of \n\n\n\n976 \n\n\n\ncards was brought to Viterbo from the country of the Saracens, \nwhere it is called naib." In that year, Saracen mercenaries served in the \narmies of rival popes Urban VI and Clement VII; but Saracenic \nArabs had occupied Spain, southern France, Sicily, and Italy since the \nearly 8th century. The Arabs dominated Spain until the 1 5 th centu- \nry. Their word naib became Spanish naipes, "playing cards." 3 \n\nGypsies migrating from their ancient home in Hindustan also \nbrought cards into Europe. Tarot cards have been called "the \ncompendium of gypsy philosophy and religion." 4 The world\'s oldest \ngambling game, Faro, came from gypsies who were supposed to be \n"Egyptians," and whose "game of kings" was naturally named Pharaoh \n(Faro) because, it was said, their cards had pharaohs painted on \nthem. 5 Spanish gypsies introduced Spain\'s national card game, ombre \n(Spanish hombre), "the game of man," which was as much a system \nof mystical divination as a game. Ombre was "a modification of the \nearlier game of primero ... of all modern games that which most \nresembles the ancient tarot. " 6 \n\nThe mysterious disappearance of the trump suit and the knights \nwas connected with more or less consistent hostility of Christian \nauthorities toward the cards. In 1370, a monk named John of Brefeld \nsaid in the symbolism of the cards "the state of the world as it is now \nis most excellently described and figured." But this turned out to be a \nheretical opinion. Other churchmen claimed the Cathari used cards \nto teach their Gnostic faith. In 1 378, the cards were banned in \nRegensburg, Germany. In 1381, they were condemned in Mar- \nseilles. In 1397, they were forbidden in Paris. In 1423, St. Bernardino \nof Siena said the cards were invented by the devil. In 1441, importa- \ntion of cards was prohibited in Venice. In 1450, a Franciscan friar \ndenounced cards in northern Italy. John Northbrooke later wrote: \n"The play at Cards is an invention of the Devil, which he found out \nthat he might the easier bring in Idolatry amongst men." Scottish \nclergymen called cards "the Devil\'s books." Churchmen were especial- \nly enraged by the Major Arcana or trump suit. These 22 little \npictures were called "the rungs of a ladder leading to the depths of \nhell." 7 Cards were described as the devil\'s breviary, "in which various \nfigures are painted, just as they are ih the breviaries of Christ, which \nfigures show forth the mysteries of evil." 8 \n\nOne may well wonder, what were these mysteries? What "idols" \ndid the idolatry of cards show forth? What doctrines were taught by \nthe "devil\'s breviary"? \n\nThe Tarot has been linked with several non-Christian mystical \nsystems: the Cabala, Hermetic magic, classical paganism, witchcraft. \nDr. Gerard Encausse wrote, "The game of cards called the Tarot, \nwhich the Gypsies possess, is the Bible of Bibles. It is the book of \nThoth Hermes Trismegistus, the book of Adam, the book of the \nprimitive Revelation of ancient civilizations." 9 A more recent student \nof the cards says, "The Tarot speaks in the language of symbols, the \n\n\n\nTarot \n\n\n\nDr. Gerard En- \ncausse French \nphysician, theoso- \nphist, and founder of \nthe popular spiritual- \nmasonic Order of \nMartinists. Under \nthe pen name of Papus, \nhe published the \nhighly influential Le \nTarot des Bohe- \nmiens in 1 889, setting a \nprecedent for Tarot \ninterpreters of the early \n20th century. \n\n\n\n977 \n\n\n\nTarot language of the unconscious, and when approached in the right \n\nmanner it may open doors into the hidden reaches of the soul." 10 \n._ In the east, whence cards originally came, there was an ancient \n\ntradition of religious insights taught through dramatic presentation or \nthrough pictures. Eastern mystics believe in the existence of a secret \ninternational symbol-code known only to initiates, whereby the true \nmeanings of religious mysteries are revealed. Similarly it was thought \nthe hieroglyphs of Egypt and central America began as a secret \nsymbol-code. Pythagorean and Orphic initiates used such code systems \nin antiquity. European mystery plays, too, conveyed Gnostic or non- \nChristian ideas in symbols and tableaux of very ancient origin, under the \nnoses of churchmen who would have suppressed them if they had \nunderstood their meaning. 11 \n\nThe Tarot strongly resembles an Oriental symbol-code when \nobserved in relation to doctrines prevailing in the east at the time of \nits European debut. Pictures of the Major Arcana can be linked with \npageants of the mystery plays, Gnostic teachings, and Orphic icons. \nHere was the real reason for opposition to the trump suit opposition so \nbitter that in the end all trumps were excised except the Fool, a \n"know-nothing." Because of the church\'s hostility, today\'s card players \nhave no trump suit, and are obliged to name one of the other suits \n"trumps" when necessary. \n\nImages of the Tarot suggest female-centered, cyclic doctrines of \nreincarnation such as the old religions taught. The cards probably \nwere the original "elf-books," allegedly given by the fairies to people \nthey loved, which enabled them to foretell the future. 12 Cards were \nassociated with witches. In German towns where witch persecutions fell \nheaviest, painters of the forbidden cards were women. 13 Moakley has \npointed out that "preachers have never liked playing cards, and it can be \nsaid that the story the cards tell is very much opposed to the basic \ntenets of Christianity." H \n\nTo understand the story, one must study the cards\' format. The \nfour suits of the Minor Arcana or Lesser Secrets are clearly related to \nOriental images of the elements. The first suit was Cups, Chalices, or \nGrails; it later became the suit of hearts. The second was Wands, \nRods, Batons, or Scepters now converted into clubs, though the club \nis not a club but a trefoil. The third suit was usually called Pentacles, \nalso rendered Coins, Disks, Denari, or Pomegranates, which became \ndiamonds. Finally there was the suit of Swords, modern spades, \nderived from Spanish espada, sword. \n\nAs cup, scepter, ring, and sword, these emblems were displayed by \nthe four-armed androgynous deity Ardhanarisvara Kali and Shiva \nmerged. 15 Other gods, such as the monkey god Hanuman, held the \nsame symbols. 16 The female earth principle Brawani also carried the \nelements as lily, flame, cross, and sword. 17 Like her the Greek Goddess \nNemesis or Fate displayed the same symbols as a cup, apple wand, \nwheel, and sword. 18 \n\n\n\n978 \n\n\n\n\nThese Tarot suit symbols stood for paired male-and-female ele- Tarot \n\nmerits: female water with male fire, female earth with male air. These \n\nin turn were linked with the four stages of life established by Tantric ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nphilosophers: Sambhoga, Nirmana, Artha, and Moksha. 19 These four \nlife-stages had the following "elemental" meanings. \n\n1 . Sambhoga, the Life of Enjoyment, was related to the feminine \nWater element and its symbol the cup, grail, or heart. It referred to \n\nthe period of youth under the tutelage of the Mother, when pleasures of \nthe senses figure most prominently in the life experience, while the \ncup of life fills up with feelings, consciousness, awareness of others. The \nTarot suit of Cups therefore was traditionally applied to the subject of \nlove, family relationships, marriages, children, emotion: matters of the \nheart, or "hearts." \n\n2. Nirmana, the Process of Building, was related to the masculine \nFire element and its symbol the phallic wand, scepter, rod, or club. It \nmeant young adulthood, the period of assertion of power, a peak of \nenergy. The wand or dorje represented the phallic lightning streaking \ntoward the waters. Tarot readers therefore applied the suit of Wands to \nmatters of status, power, business, and commerce. \n\nThe straight Wand became a trefoil through an alchemical trans- \nformation. The trefoil was an alchemical symbol for wood, sometimes \ncalled Wood of the Tree of Life. 20 The Chinese considered wood a \nfifth element, placed between earth, which gave birth to it, and fire, \nwhich consumed it. 21 The Wand of the Tarot associated with fire would \nhave meant a wooden torch, therefore the symbol of wood changed it \ninto a modern "club." \n\n3. Artha, "Earth," stood for Wealth or Possessions: the period of Symbol of Wood \nmiddle age when the fruits of labor accumulate, and grown children \nalso are "wealth." The feminine Earth element was associated with \nriches in all Indo-European traditions, and so the Goddess\'s pentacle \nbecame a diamond, the Far-Eastern earth-symbol whose very name \nmeant "Goddess of the World." The oldest form of money was a \nfemale-genital cowrie shell, and coins used to be manufactured in the \nMother Goddess\'s temple at Rome. 22 It was not illogical then that the \nTarot suit of Pentacles was related to money matters and property. \nSometimes they were Pomegranates, another female symbol. 23 \n\n4. Moksha, "Liberation," or the Art of Dying, was linked with the \nmasculine Air element that meant the soul released from the body, \ninto the keeping of the Lord of Death, or Kali the Destroyer, represent- \ned by the sword. Eastern philosophers viewed old age, the fourth \nlife-stage, as an opportune time to learn to approach death without fear. \nHowever, the Tarot suit of Swords was linked with fear-inspiring \nevents: calamities, difficulties, threats, various kinds of doom. Even in \nordinary playing cards, the suit of spades, the Swords\' descendant, \nwas reckoned a suit of evil omen. \n\nThe underlying theory of cartomancy was that shuffling the \ncards was like mixing the elements in the larger world. Fate would guide \n\n\n\n979 \n\n\n\nT*ot the diviner to make combinations which, properly interpreted, would \n\napply to past or future events that the mingling of elements brought \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ about. Suit colors still show the blood-red of life for the "female" \n\nelements, the black of death for the "male" elements, according to very \nancient Oriental ideas of the active energy of the Lady of Life as \nopposed to the passivity of the Lord of Death. It is perhaps oddly \nsignificant that the oversized ace of modern cards is the ace of spades, \nsymbolically the sword of Father Heaven, which fortune-tellers called \nthe card of death. \n\nWhen churchmen failed to eradicate playing cards, there were \nseveral attempts to adapt the cards to Christian orthodoxy. Major \nArcana pictures were described as various episodes in Christ\'s Passion as \nif they represented Stations of the Cross. 24 Another system tried to \nrelate the four suits to the four Grail Hallows, listed in the 12th century \nas (1) the chalice of the Last Supper; (2) the wooden lance St. \nLonginus used to pierce Jesus\'s side; (3) the round paten or platter from \nwhich Jesus\'s disciples ate the paschal lamb, and (4) King David\'s \n"Sword of the Spirit." These Grail Hallows were themselves un- \nchristian, having been lifted from the Four Treasures of pagan \nIreland, magical emblems of the Tuatha De Danann. These were: (1) \nthe Cauldron of Regeneration; (2) the Spear of Lug; (3) the Stone of \nFal, or Stone of Sovereignty, which like the Scots\' Stone of Scone \nwould cry out in recognition of a true king; and (4) the Sword of \nNuada. 25 Typical lingam-yoni combination of the last two formed the \nfamous "Sword in the Stone" that figured in myths of Arthur, \nPerceval, and Galahad. \n\nA 1 5th-century game called Triumphs associated the four suits \nwith qualities resembling the Tantric definitions of the four elemental \nlife-stages: (1) Pleasures, (2) Virtues, (3) Riches, and (4) Virginities. 26 \nThese are easily identified with the male-female elements. "Virtues" \ncame from virtu, "manliness, uprightness" in the dual sense of erect- \nness. "Virginities" referred to the ascetic life recommended for the \nelder sage in eastern lands. But the game itself was named after the \nMajor Arcana the "trump" suit that clergymen called heretical. \n\nThe word "trump" came from trionfiov "triumph," the old Latin \nword for a religious procession, in which the very sequence, cos- \ntumes, and masks of the marchers stood for doctrinal teachings the \ninitiates could understand. Images of the deities, sacred masks borne \nby temple dancers, charioteers, priests, and priestesses displayed the \nexuviae, "attributes," of divinities. The leader of the procession was \nthe triumphator, a magistrate in charge of Rome\'s sacred games. At the \nend of the drama or the parade, celebrants raised the cry of Triumpe, \nannouncing the immanence of divine spirit in the things and persons \nshown. 27 Trump, then, originally meant "that which is divine," and \nlike everything divine it was credited with power of divination. \n\nAccording to ancient ideas of the divine order, deities revealed \nthemselves within a calculated framework of time. An initiate into \n\n\n\n980 \n\n\n\nany of the pagan Mysteries would meet them one at a time, learning Tarot \n\nnew thoughts from each. A time-frame appeared in the Tarot as well \n\nas the matter-frame of the elements. This had to do with its numbering. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe number of Minor Arcana cards is 56, a number with pro- \nfound meanings in Oriental philosophy. When Buddha was born, he \ntook his first 56 steps in each of the four cardinal directions, 7 forward \nand 7 back each way, signifying the 14 waxing and 14 waning days of \nthe moon and the lunar weeks, like the 14 steps on the heavenly ladder \nof Osiris. 28 \n\nThe same number of posts or stones representing "steps in time" \ncircled old temples of astronomical calculation, like Stonehenge. \nThere were 56 years in a sacred Great Year when lunar and solar cycles \ncoincided. 29 The number of the Tarot\'s Sun card is 19, the number \nof the Moon card 18: and the ancient Great Year consisted of two 19- \nyear periods combined with an 18-year period, a total of 56 years to \nbring the sun and moon together. The total number of cards in a Tarot \npack, 78, was the sum of all the numbers of the signs of the zodiac \nadded together: 1 +24-3+4+5 + 6 + 7 + 8+9+ 10+11 + 12. \n\nAmong the many derivations offered for the mysterious word \nTarot was the famous palindrome ROTA TARO ORAT (TORA) \nATOR: the Wheel of the Taro speaks of (the Law of) Hathor. 30 \nHowever, the Oriental background of card-divination and the 2 1 \nnumbered cards of the Major Arcana suggest an older connection with \nthe Goddess Tara, the Aryan Great Mother as "Earth," whose name \ngave rise to Latin Terra Mater and Celtic Tara. \n\nFrom ancient times, this Goddess was assigned 2 1 forms. Magic \ndiagrams, or painted dice-boards for divining the cause of illness, \nprophesying, and so on, are still known as "the 21 Taras." If the 21 \nnumbered cards of the Major Arcana can be related to such boards, \nthe Minor Arcana certainly echo the similar boards of 56 squares used \n"for determining the successive regions and grades of one\'s future \nrebirths." 31 In the Far East, games like cards and dice were used to \nteach esoteric doctrines. Tantric Buddhists still enjoy the Game of \nRebirth played with dice and a colorful board; it is both a pastime and a \nteaching aid for spiritual doctrines. 32 \n\nAs in China, cards were created from the possible throws of rods in \nthe I Ching, so divination by dice obviously influenced the format of \nthe Tarot. The two Tarot numbers 56 and 21 are dice numbers 21 \nthe number of possible throws by a set of two dice and 56 the number \nof possible throws by a set of three dice. Together they add up to 77 \nseven-times-eleven, the ultimate number of dice games. The Tarot \npack has one more card, making 78, but this card has no numerical \nvalue. It is the Fool, whose number is zero. In many Tarot layouts he \nstands apart, as an observer or querent. 33 \n\nThe form and meaning of Hindu temples also had some influence \non the Tarot. Images showing various manifestations or avatars of the \ndeities were placed in rows along corridors leading to the central Holy of \n\n\n\n981 \n\n\n\nTaiot Holies. Devout pilgrims passed through this "instructive picture \n\ngallery" saying prayers at each station. 34 Pictures of the deities and thei \n^^^^^^^^^^ attributes used to be painted on cards, like a miniature picture gallery, \nfor private meditation. Such a pasteboard pageant revealed sacred \nmysteries to those who knew its symbolism. In this circumstance one \nmight find the real reason why Christians objected to the Major \nArcana not because the cards were frivolous, but because their \nunderlying meanings were all too serious. \n\nThe most significant arrangement in Oriental sacred graphics was \nthe triangle, sign of the Goddess, known as the Kali Yantra or \nPrimordial Image. 35 A female triangle with a central dot or bindu, \n"spark of life," stood for the Goddess\'s genital power bringing life \ninto being. The 21 numbered Tarot trumps seemed designed to form \nthis yantra, 7 cards to each side of the triangle, with the unnumbered \nFool in the center standing for the bindu. \n\nThe three sides of the triangle traditionally represented the Triple \nGoddess as Three Fates, ruling past, present, and future; the three \ntrimesters of intrauterine existence; and the three larger trimesters of \nextrauterine life: from birth to coming-of-age at 21; from 21 to \nmiddle age at 42; and from 42 to the "grand climacteric" at 63. The \nsame three stages of man\'s life were depicted in such classical images \nas the Riddle of the Sphinx. \n\nThe biblical God promised his followers a lifetime of threescore \nand ten years, offering seven years more than older deities who \nguaranteed only the mystically trinitarian number of threescore and \nthree (63). The pagan lifespan was remembered in medieval times, \nwhen the age of 63 was known as the grand climacteric and was thougl \nto carry a threat of death. 36 It is still believed that 21 is the pinnacle of \nfirst maturity, because the pagan system of age-counting became incor- \nporated in common law. \n\nEach trimester spanned 21 years, the first exclusive multiple of th( \nsacred numbers 3 and 7. Therefore the past, present, and future \ncould be envisioned in the Major Arcana arranged in one of the \nGoddess\'s essential sigils. This triangular format was often used by \nthe gypsies, who understood that "triangle" meant "female" and that \nthe Goddess was the trinitarian ruler of Fate. 37 \n\nThe last trump is called the World, also known as the Bride, the \nShekjna, the Universe, Mother Nature, Sophia, or the Major For- \ntune. 38 This card always showed a naked woman dancing within a \nflower wreath, flanked by emblems of the four seasons. This was the \nfinal revelation of the Tarot system: the Goddess without her veils, the \nShakti bringing joy to the moment of death. According to the \ndoctrine of karma, "She it is who is ever desired, won, and lost again." 3 \nIn the cyclic or continuous layouts favored by gypsy cartomancers, \nthe realization of the World led "naturally on to the next card, the Fool \nsymbol of the newly born child commencing its life\'s journey. And so \n\n\n\n982 \n\n\n\nthe Ring of Return revolves once more." 40 In other words, the religion Tarot \n\nof the Tarot was a cyclic religion of reincarnation, not a linear \n\nreligion of heaven-or-hell choices. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nA popular method of laying out the cards signified two Rings of \nreturn, the joined circles of the Right-Hand Path (clockwise) and the \nLeft-Hand Path (counterclockwise), traditional symbols of male and \nfemale powers combined in a horizontal figure eight, the Vedic sign of \nInfinity. This was inherited by the Arabs along with the other \n"Arabic" numerals (actually of Indian origin), and is still the sign of \ninfinity in modern mathematics. The Major Arcana strongly suggest- \ned this figure-eight layout by their own traditional designs. \n\nThe lemniscate infinity-sign appeared as a wide-brimmed hat or \nhalo over the head of the Magician, a male figure beginning the first \ndecade of trumps at the #1 position. The same sign appeared again as \nthe same wide-brimmed hat or halo over the head of the Goddess of \nStrength, a female figure beginning the second decade of trumps at the \n#11 position. The male and female figures hinted that the first circle \noften cards was to rotate clockwise, along the "solar" path; the second \ncircle often cards was to rotate counterclockwise, along the "lunar" \npath. \n\nThe figure-eight represented union of the sexes not only in the \nOrient, but also in the ancient Celtic marriage rite preserved by the \nScottish custom of handfasting. Bride and groom joined their right \n"male" hands, then their left "female" hands also, forming the \ndouble-sexed Infinity sign to signify the blending of their two natures. \nThis custom is still followed in India, where the symbolism of the \nRight-Hand Path and Left-Hand Path was never lost. 41 \n\nBesides the Magician and the Goddess of Strength, another card \npresented the Infinity sign: the deuce of Pentacles, showing two discs \nembraced by two endlessly circling serpents, or a comparable lemniscate \ndesign. The importance of this card was revealed by special decora- \ntions; it usually bore the maker\'s trademark, as the ace of spades does \ntoday. Clearly, the figure-eight layout was urged. But then, what did \nit show? \n\nThe first circle stood for the realm of consciousness, matter, the \nworld of affairs: solar, outward-turning all the cards faced out. The \nsecond circle stood for the unconscious or the spirit lunar, inward, \nfeminine, the realm of mysteries and "true meanings." The center \ncrossing superimposed the two "mandala" cards, the Wheel of Fortune \nand the World (or Major Fortune). In such an arrangement, each \ncard in the solar sphere matched a card in the lunar sphere, their two \nnumbers always totaling 20, a sacred number in the eastern decimal \nsystem. 42 Each pair of matched cards revealed a secret identity or \nmeaning. \n\nThe Magician, or Hermes (#1) corresponded in the spiritual \nrealm to the masculine power of the Sun (#19). The Papess (#2) \n\n\n\n983 \n\n\n\nTa|ot was revealed as a personification of the Moon (#18). The Empress \n\n(#3) was the same as the Naked Goddess pouring forth her blessings \non land and sea, on the card of the Star (# 1 7) i.e., Astarte or Ishtar. \n\n^ ^^ m The Emperor (#4) stood for the Holy Roman Empire, which would \nsoon suffer a downfall, according to the heretical prediction; and the \ndownfall of the Empire was shown on the corresponding card, #16, \nthe Tower, or the House of God, blasted by the lightning of Lucifer the \nLight-bringer. Two figures toppling from the crown of the lightning- \nstruck Tower could well have been Emperor and Pope. As for the Pope \nhimself, shown on card #5, in the spiritual realm of the Tarot he was \nrevealed as the Devil (#15), taking the same pose on both cards with \ntwo worshippers at his feet. 43 \n\nTarot cards were not the only manifestations of these subversive \nsymbols. The same pictures mysteriously appeared in many places, \nincluding even churches. Rheims Cathedral still has a carved stone \npanel showing the lightning-struck Tower with the two male figures \nfalling from its blasted crown. 44 An engraved Horoscope wheel manu- \nfactured at Niirnberg in 1515 placed seven of the Major Arcana \npictures in various zodiacal positions. 45 The figures of the World, the \nWheel of Fortune, Justice, the Fool, and Death the skeletal Grim \nReaper with his scythe were common illustrations of the medieval \nZeitgeist; but no one knows whether they were copied from the \nTarot, or the card pictures were copied from them. \n\nJust before the card of Death came the card perhaps most \ncharacteristic of the Tarot alone: the Hanged Man, who "cannot be \nfound in any orthodox Christian symbology, and is one of the clearest \nindications that the Tarot trumps were designed to illustrate some \nnon-Christian system of belief." 46 The Hanged Man hung on a door- \nshaped gallows such as Norse pagans called the Wooden Horse, or \nthe Horse of Odin. 47 Even though the figure of Death immediately \nfollowed him, it was only a symbolic death. He hung, not by the \nneck, but by one foot: a custom known as "baffling," inflicted on \ndebtors and traitors in Germany, Italy, and Scotland. 48 Baffling was a \nformal humiliation, like a sojourn in the stocks, or like the mockery of \nsacred-king-victims (such as Jesus). Mystical initiations imitated such \nprocedures, so the novice "should empty himself completely, should be \nstripped of all his faculties, renouncing all his own predilections, his \nown thoughts, his own will in a word, his whole self." 49 The Hanged \nMan\'s number, 12, recalled the famous Twelfth Rune sacred to \nOdin the Hanged God, the rune by which hanged victims could be \nmade to speak, and reveal the mysteries of the death- world. 50 \n\nThe mystic revelation following the Hanged Man\'s encounter \nwith Death was the female figure of Temperance, copied from magic \ntexts that showed the Goddess Isis with one foot on land, the other in \nwater, revealing her dominion over both elements. 51 This Temper- \nance angel poured water from one jar into another, recalling the \n\n\n\n984 \n\n\n\nsymbolic merging of Isis and Osiris in the Amulet of the Two Jars, an Tartarus \n\nancient Egyptian charm of eternal life. 52 Similarly in India, the revela- \ntion of divine love was a merging of God and Goddess "like the ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \npouring of water into water." 53 One of the incarnations of the God \nhimself was a water jar, just as Babylonian, Egyptian, and Cabirian \nsavior-deities were symbolized by water jars in their holy processions, as \nwas Jesus also, according to Luke 22:10. In the Far East, the vessel of \nwater was regarded as the residence of the deity. 54 Moreover, this same \nWater-Jar-Savior appeared in Hindu playing cards at the head of the \nsuit of Jars, which corresponded to the Tarot suit of Cups. 55 \n\nThus the European Tarot seemed to show a man symbolically \ndying, and meeting a manifestation of the Goddess as a result. This \nmeeting or merging, "like the pouring of water into water," prefigured \nthe final meeting with the cosmic Mother upon actual death the \nLast Trump just as a man\'s sexual union with his earthly Shakti \nprefigured his union with the ultimate Shakti of the spirit realm, Kali \nherself. Small wonder then that patriarchal Christians regarded the \nTarot as a Bible of heresy comprehensible to the illiterate, at a time \nwhen even literate laymen were officially forbidden to read their own \nBible. 56 The Oriental origin of its heretical Tantric/Gnostic imagery \nis suggested by the Slavic word for a "reader" of the cards: Vedavica, \nliterally a Vedic seer. 57 Small wonder that some of the bishops and \ncardinals tried to collect packs of cards and burn them, as was done in \nNiimberg in 1452. 58 Cards became harmless to the church only after \ntheir religious symbols were removed and their meanings forgotten, so \nthey were mere "games" ludicrous, in the new interpretation of the \nold pagan ludiox "sacred games." To Hebrew patriarchs also, naipes, \n"cards," became naibi, "sorcery." 59 \n\n1. A. Douglas, 21. 2. Cavendish, T., 18. 3. A. Douglas, 20. 4. Trigg, 47. \n\n5. Funk, 320. 6. Hazlitt, 460. 7.

A cruel overlord ordered Tell to shoot an apple from \nhis son\'s head with an arrow to prove his skill. Tell performed the feat \nsuccessfully, holding a second arrow which he said would have slain the \noppressor, had the junior Tell been injured. \n\nThe same tale was told earlier of the Rhineland archer-wizard \nnamed Puncker (Marksman), ordered by Prince Eberhard Long- \nbeard to shoot a penny off his son\'s head. Puncker too held a second \narrow, saying if he failed the test, the second arrow would have \npenetrated Longbeard\'s heart. 1 \n\nIn the 12th century, Saxo Grammaticus told the same story about \nToki, a Danish archer-wizard forced by King Harald Bluetooth to \nshoot an apple from his son\'s head. The same incident occurred in the \nmythical history of Egil, brother of Velundr, in the Saga of Thidrick. \nAnother Norse hero, Eindridi, was obliged to shoot a writing-tablet off \nhis son\'s head. Another, Hemingr, had to throw a spear at a hazel nut \non the head of his brother Bjorn. The Faroe Island archer-wizard was \nGeyti, whom King Harald commanded to shoot a hazel nut from his \nbrother\'s head. \n\nAll the stories may have come from an ancient Persian poem, the \nMantic Uttair, or Language of Birds, by Farad-Uddin Attar.

A Hebrew commentator said the teraphim were \nancestral ghosts, in the form of mummified oracular heads. 1 Their \nname means "children of Terah." The Bible says Terah "begat" \nAbraham; but the word translated "begat" often meant "gave birth \nto," and many of the so-called patriarchs in the Pentateuch are feminine \n\n\n\n987 \n\n\n\nTerra Rrma names. If Abraham was the same as Ab-Brahm or Father Brahma, his \n\nTetragrammaton parent would have been the Goddess Tara, a universal name of Mother \n\n^ m Earth. \n\nThe Jews\' teraphim were similar to the Romans\' lares or manes, \nalso ancestral spirits residing in relics. Like the worshippers of \nteraphim, African natives still believe a dead ancestor\'s spirit can inhabit \nan effigy especially if the effigy contains physiological relics like \nbones, teeth, hair, etc. and by consulting such an idol one can \ncommunicate directly with the ancestor. 2 \n\nThere were many Middle-Eastern peoples whose habit it was to \npreserve skulls of the dead for later necromantic consultation, espe- \ncially the skulls of sacred kings. Their place of sacrifice called Golgotha, \nalleged scene of Jesus\'s crucifixion, meant "the place of skulls." \n\n1 .

To the Greeks she was \nGaea the Deep-Breasted One, who ruled Mount Olympus before \nthe coming of the Hellenic gods. See Tara. \n\n\n\nTetragrammaton \n\nLiterally, "four-letter word," the secret name of God in Hebrew \nletters yod-he-vau-he (YHWH); often confused with God\'s introduc- \ntion of himself to Moses, "I Am That I Am" (Exodus 3:14). This \nintroduction was borrowed from the god Ab-braham or Father Brahma, \nwho introduced himself in Sanskrit Tat Sat "I Am That that Is." \' \n\nThe root of YHWH is the radical HWH, he-vau-he, which meant \n"being" or "life" or "woman" interchangeable concepts in the \nancient Middle East. 2 The same letters in Latin are E-V-E: Eve. 3 Thus \nthe so-called inner meaning of the Tetragrammaton was really Eve, \nMother of All Living, the real creator of the world and mother of Adam, \naccording to Gnostic scriptures. 4 \n\nThe Tetragrammaton had two versions. The lesser-known one \nwas EHYH, a feminine principle derived from Hayya (another of \nEve\'s names), designating the Goddess in her special connection with \nwomen in childbed. On Samaritan phylacteries the masculine and \nfeminine versions of the Tetragrammaton were intertwined. 5 \n\nMedieval writers who didn\'t know the meaning of Tetragramma- \nton often took it for the name of a powerful demon, and invoked it in \nmagic charms. A 17th-century writer declared that "the mighty Tetra- \ngrammaton" was a devil who protected witches. 6 Other authorities \n\n\n\nsaid Tetragrammaton was one of the more powerful secret names of Teutatis \n\nGod, used to control demons when they were invoked. (See Name.) Thais, Saint \n\nJewish mystics used the Tetragrammaton extensively in the lore of ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nthe Cabala. YHWH was called the Divided Name, "considered to \ncontain all the Forces of Nature." Since the holy name could be divided \ninto that of Mother Eve (HWH), and that of the "I" or jod for \nJehovah, it suggested the cabalistic doctrine of God\'s loss of his Shekina, \nthe Great Mother, whose return the mystics believed essential to the \nachievement of peace in the universe. \n\nSometimes the Tetragrammaton was called Sem ha-mephoras, or \nSchemahamphorasch, probably the origin of the word "semaphore" \nin the sense of a word-sign like the Hindu samjna? Rabbinic tradition \nsaid the Sem ha-mephoras either was inscribed on a holy phallic stone \nburied in the Great Gate of Mother Earth, or else was the stone itself, \nalso called Eben stijjah, the Stygian Stone, or Stone of the Deeps. It \nwas connected with the sexual myth of the descent of Father Heaven\'s \nphallus into the yoni of the virgin Mother Earth, to "unlock her \nfountains," that is, to stimulate the Nether Upsurge of world-sustaining \nblood. Sexual organs of God and Goddess lay at the center of the \nholy of Holies. "David is supposed to have found at the digging of the \nfoundation of the temple, the Eben stijjah, Stone of the Deeps, that \nunlocked the fountain of the great deep, and on which the Sem ha- \nmephoras, the outspoken name of God, was inscribed." 8 \n\n1.

To fulfill what seemed to be one of the ascetics\' favorite \nfantasies, Thais at the height of her beauty and fame was said to have re- \nnounced her sins, mortified her flesh, burned her fine clothes and \nornaments, given away all her wealth to the church, and walled herself \nup in a desert cell to live in the midst of her own filth. 1 The only trou- \nble with the hagiographer\'s tale was that, at the time it was supposed to \n\n\n\n989 \n\n\n\nThalassa \nThemis \n\n\n\nhave happened, Thais had already been dead for more than 600 \nyears. \n\nl.Aftwatcr, 320. \n\n\n\nThalassa \n\nThe Goddess at Rhodes and Miletus, mother of the Telchines \n("enchanters").

In the 4th \ncentury it was attended by a group called Apotactics, under a female \n"deacon," subsequently declared heretical. 2 Some Christians asserted \nthat St. Thecla was Diana\'s priestess. 3 Others, like Tertullian, knew \nshe was nothing but an epithet of the Great Goddess. Tertullian denied \nthe legend connecting Thecla with St. Paul, calling it a lie invented \nby a misguided church elder "for love of St. Paul" a curious explana- \ntion, hinting that Paul might have been honored by the connection. 4 \n\nl.Attwater,321. 2.

Her Virgin aspect was Artemis (Ar-Themis); her name \nwas numerically equivalent to that of the moon. 1 Her children were \nThemistes, "oracles." She founded the oracle of Delphi ("Womb"), \nlong before it was taken over by Apollo. \n\nBlack Sea Amazons worshipped Themis in the form of a black \nstone on their sacred island of Themiscyra, "Divine Themis." The \nRoman Forum had an ancient black stone, the Lapis Niger, engraved \nwith the Goddess\'s sacred law. 3 In faraway Iceland the same Goddess \nwas adored in the form of a stone called Spamathr, "Mother of \nProphecy," or Armathr, "Mother of Prosperity." 4 \n\nTo the Egyptians, Themis was "Temu," spirit of the fertile Abyss \nthat gave birth to all things in the beginning. \n\n\n\n990 \n\n\n\nClassic myth made Themis the spirit of the post-diluvian creation. \nAfter the Flood receded, Themis taught the survivors Deucalion and \nPyrrha how to repopulate the earth by magic.

On resolving the \nriddle, they understood that Themis meant stones, the bones of their \nMother Earth. 5 By the grace of the Goddess, new human beings rose \nup from these stones. \n\n1.

The weakness of theol- \nogy as a "science" is its lack of objective proof for any of its claims. \nVetter points out that any theologian in the modern age is likely to be \nconfused and worried: "He is trying to reconcile science with faith \nand dogma, and they are simply not to be reconciled." 1 \n\nSince Galileo\'s time, Christian theology has been concerned not \nwith justifying God\'s ways to man but with justifying God\'s ways to \nscience. This is usually done by reasoning backward from religion\'s \ngiven conclusions to theoretical causes. In 1952, Pope Pius XII \ndemonstrated this in an astonishing series of non sequiturs to force \n"science" to prove the existence of God: \n\nWhat significance, then, has modern science for the proof of the existence \nof God, which depends on the fact that the cosmos is susceptible of \nchange? . . . From the fact that there is change we may conclude that \nthere is an Absolute Being whose nature is unchangeable. . . . [Science] \nhas, with the concreteness that belongs to physical proof, confirmed the \nprinciple of contingency and the conclusion based on it that . . . the \ncosmos came into being by the hand of the Creator. 2 \n\nOnly theology could make such a long, loose-jointed leap from \nthe fact that there is change to a "conclusion" that something un- \nchangeable must exist. Needless to say, science has not confirmed \nany such thing as the theological principle of contingency with any \n"physical proof"; theologians simply don\'t understand what physical \nproof consists of. \n\nTheological problems are not solved by physical evidence but by \nadjustment of verbal definitions. The usual method is debate. Medi- \neval Schoolmen earnestly debated such questions as how many angels \ncould dance on the head of a pin, or whether the earth hung from \nheaven by a golden chain or an iron one. "Evidence" was taken from \nanalogy. For instance, Peter Lombard\'s rules on incest said it was all \nright to marry outside the sixth degree of consanguinity because there \nwere six ages of the world. In 1215 the fourth Lateran Council \n\n\n\nPeter Lombard Ec- \nclesiastical teacher of \nthe 1 2th century, \nbishop of Paris, author \nof many sermons, \ncommentaries on scrip- \nture, and theological \ntreatises known as the \nBooks of Sentences. \n\n\n\n991 \n\n\n\nTheology declared it was even all right to marry outside the fourth degree of \n\nconsanguinity, because there were four humors in the body and four \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ elements in the universe. 3 \n\nMost of the time, theology and science have been implacable \nenemies. 1 The aggression has been on the side of theology, not \nscience; the latter simply pursues facts, the former attacks facts because \nthey threaten orthodox fantasies. \n\nThe priesthoods of whatever stripe can never live down, nor make amends \nfor, their disgraceful role in retarding the development of modern \nscience during the past millenium in Christendom. But what is even \nworse, they seem to have learned nothing from that defeat and are now \nclosing ranks, better to fight the same sort of a battle in the area of the \nsocial sciences and ethics. . . . [S]upernaturalism is, in its social func- \ntions and consequences, a dangerous opiate. And, what is perhaps even \nworse, it discourages objective attempts at intelligent social trial-and- \nerror, planning, and even research, and undermines man s faith in his own \nresources. . . . \n\nThe methods and principles of the theologians are still the same; \nthey have merely abandoned certain fields as no longer profitable for \nexploitation and have concentrated their efforts in the psychological and \nsociological, derived out of a distant past. Their sole claim to validity \ntoday derives from the extent of their social acceptability, not from any \nempirical validation. To preserve that social acceptability organized \nreligion bends its every effort to keep "controversial" topics out of public \neducational institutions and to provide as much parochial education as \npossible for as many of the "faithful" as possible. s \n\nTo provide the kind of education defined as Christian, it has \nbeen necessary for theologians to lie, and then to find words that call \ntheir lies morally right. Such semantic wriggling is shown by a book \nfor Catholic laymen by Edwin F. Healy, S.J., published in I960 under \nthe rather astonishing title of Mora] Guidance. \n\nAt times one is obliged in conscience to veil the truth, for there are secrets \nto be guarded and detractions to be avoided. Sometimes silence will not \nsuffice to maintain the secret which one is trying to guard. In fact, it may \nhappen that silence would betray the secret. Hence there must be some \nlicit means of concealing the truth when necessary. This licit means is the \nbroad mental reservation. . . . One way of putting the question is to ask \nif a false statement is always a lie. Some theologians answer in the \nnegative. . . . Sometimes it is necessary to make a false statement in \norder to protect secret knowledge. Silence or the use of mental reservation \nis not sufficient; the only way to protect the secret is to make a \nstatement contrary to what you know to be true. 6 \n\nIn direct ideological descent from Eusebius who extolled "holy lying" \nfor the church\'s sake, Healy makes "licit" every form of falsehood. \nChurchmen themselves seldom believed the lies they told, or al- \nlowed, as shown by the 19th-century clergymen\'s aphorism: "He may \nhold anything who holds his tongue." 7 The theologian Beausobre \nwrote: \n\n\n\n992 \n\n\n\nChurchmen not only do not say what they think, but they do say the Theotokos \n\ndirect contrary of what they think. Philosophers in their cabinets; out of \n\nthem they are content with fables, though they well know they are fables. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nNay, more: they deliver honest men to the executioner, for having \n\nuttered what they themselves know to be true. How many atheists and \n\npagans have burned holy men under the pretext of heresy? Every day \n\ndo hypocrites consecrate, and make people adore the host, though as well \n\nconvinced as I am, that it is nothing but a bit of bread. 8 \n\nPerhaps the most dangerous truth, about which theologians \nalways lied, was the one advanced by the Arab philosopher Averroes: \nthat all religions are of equal validity or nonvalidity, because all are \nmerely human productions. 9 Judeo-Christian tradition could not bear \nthis idea, for it taught that not only were its scriptures directly dictated \nby God but its religion was the only "right" one even though shaped \nand supported by false statements. \n\nHow could the modern church acknowledge, Guignebert asks, \n"that religion lives its whole life in the consciousness of men and that \nhuman consciousness has changed since the thirteenth century?" \nOrthodoxy must believe itself immutable, but it is always embarrassed \nby the records of its mistakes. Renan says, "There is one thing that a \ntheologian can never be, and that is a historian. History is necessarily \ndisinterested. . . . The theologian has one interest, his dogma. If this \ndogma be trimmed down as much as ever it can be, then it is still for the \ncritical mind an unbearable load. The orthodox theologian may be \ncompared to a bird in a cage; all real movement is forbidden to it." 10 \n\nThe conclusion that theology once found unthinkable is becoming \nmore and more thinkable. "What gods are there, what gods have \nthere ever been, that were not from man\'s imagination? " \' \' To insist on \ndeities in the real world, the theologian must resort to intellectual \ndishonesty. "One should claim as knowledge only what he really knows, \nand admit that he does not know what he doesn\'t know. The \ncharacteristic Western ardor for answering the unanswerable would be \nmore uplifting if it did not entail claims of certitude." n Morton \nSmith points out that "When a theologian talks of a \'higher truth,\' he is \nusually trying to conceal a lower falsehood." 1B \n\nl.Vetter,257. 2.

Spretnak, 269. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Thesmophoria." \n\n\n\nThomas Rhymer \n\nThomas Learmont, also known as Thomas of Erceldoune, a 14th- \ncentury Scottish poet-seer. Erceldoune (now Earlston) was "Ercel\'s \nDown," seat of the Saxon Goddess Ercel, or Ursel, or Horsel, the \n"Fairy Queen" who loved Thomas and taught him secrets of magic. \nThomas was accosted on Huntlie Bank by the incumbent Queen of \nElphame, an earthly incarnation of the Goddess, who taught him the \nsecrets of the witch cult and re-baptized him as True Thomas when \nhe had renounced Christianity. 1 \n\nAccording to "The Ballad of Thomas Rhymer," the Fairy Queen \nshowed Thomas three roads: one leading to heaven, a second to hell, \nand a third to "fair Elf-land," that is, a Way that was neither Christian \nnor anti-Christian. Along the third road he came to the River of \nBlood, comparable to the Greeks\' birth-river Styx, or the river of \ngiantesses\' menstrual blood, crossed by the god Thor on his way to \nthe land of elder deities. Here Thomas entered a very mysterious place: \n"For forty days and forty nights / He wade thro\' red blude to the \nknee, / And he saw neither sun nor moon, / But heard the roaring of the \nsea." 2 \n\nThe legend suggests a Tantric sort of enlightenment, brought \nabout by communion with female life-essence. The Fairy Queen \nstated that she had "claret wine" in her lap and invited Thomas to lay \nhis head there. The original meaning of "claret" was perception, or \nenlightenment. In common English usage, claret was also a synonym \nfor blood. In Celtic myth, the Fairy Queen offered "red mead" \nwhich was also herself, Mab (Mead). 5 The Norse version of Thomas \nwas Sir Bosmer, who swam the "eddying flood" to the Elf-Queen as \nshe stood on the far bank, saying, "Welcome, Sir Bosmer! Come home \nto me, I\'ve brewed the mead and the wine for thee." 4 Such tales tend \nto confirm clergymen\'s insistence that menstrual blood was the \ncommunion wine of witches. \n\nAfter Thomas\'s journey to the secret paradise, where he remained \nseven years recalling the seven windings of the Styx he became a \n\n\n\n994 \n\n\n\ngreat wizard, poet, and prophet, ranked with such sages of the old faith \nas Merlin and Tristan. 5 \n\n1.

Tammuz then became Doubting Thomas, challenging \nJesus\'s claim to authentic apotheosis and resurrection in the flesh. He \nrefused to believe in his rival\'s return from death until he had probed \nhis wounds. Then, Thomas-Tammuz announced his acceptance of \nJesus as "my Lord and my God" (John 20:28) or so the Gospel \nwould have it. \n\nThe story of Doubting Thomas appears only in the so-called \nGnostic Gospel of John, written more than 1 50 years after Jesus\'s \npurported lifetime. 1 Its purpose was to press Christian claims to superi- \nority over the old deities. \n\nThomas the doubter-turned-convert was also Thomas the twin: \nChristian legends admitted that Jesus and Thomas-Tammuz had the \nsame face and were really the same god. According to some sources, the \nrival\'s name was Judas Thomas, or Judas the Tammuz, whose face \nwas the same as Jesus\'s face. 2 Judas and Jesus seem to have been \ntraditional names taken by victims in whom the god Tammuz was \nincarnate. \n\nDuring the 4th century, a shrine at Edessa was taken over by \nfollowers of the new Tammuz now called St. Thomas, Apostle to \nIndia and the usual phony relics were installed. 3 \n\nl.Enslin, L.C.M.,451. 2.

Thor had at least six major \nsanctuaries in England; Thurstable in Essex was originally "Thor\'s \nPillar." Thor\'s cult persisted up to the 1 1th century when a Christian \nchronicler said Thor or his priest was "a wicked man of Kent" \nacting as the king\'s counselor. Saxons converted to Christianity were \nobliged to renounce "Thunaer, Woden and Saxnot, and all those \ndemons who are their companions." x \n\nYet Thor continued to be worshipped in the north. His sanctuary \nat Maerin in Trondheim was still active in the 1 1th century. 2 Eligius, \nbishop of Noyons, scolded Christians for observing Thursday as the \nholy day of Thor in the 7th century; yet even 500 years later, Thor\'s \n\n\n\nvar.

In Prussia up to the 16th century, Jupiter-Thor was wor- \nshipped by the people in "sacred woods in which they made sacrifices \nand sacred springs which Christians were not allowed to approach." 3 \n\nThor apparently descended from the Middle-Eastern thunder-bull \nwho was also Jupiter. Plutarch said the Phoenician thunder god was \nThur, the bull. 4 The Germanic Thor "bellowed like a bull" as he \nswung his hammer. 5 Like other forms of the bull god, he was married \nto the Earth Goddess as Thrud, "Power" or "Strength." 6 Though late \nmyths sometimes called Thrud his "daughter," Thor\'s home in \nAsgard belonged to her. It was called Thrudvangar, "Thrud\'s Field." 7 \n\n1. Turville-Petre, 99-100. 2. Oxenstierna, 294. 3. H.R.E. Davidson, G.M.V.A., 81-87. \n4. Knight, S.L., 20. 5. Lamusse, 261. 6.

His \nholy city was known as Hermopolis, "City of Hermes." Priests of \nHermopolis pretended that Thoth had created the world, either by \nhatching the World Egg (which he encircled in the form of the \nGnostic Serpent), or by speaking the words of creation, after the \nmanner of the biblical God. (See Logos; Ur-Text.) The Book of \nThoth was a famous legendary work supposed to reveal the secrets of \nmanipulating matter by verbal charms. \n\nLike Hermes and other manifestations of the Wise Serpent, Thoth \nowed his powers to his former close association with the Great \nMother. He was lunar in nature, rather than solar. When he ascended \nto heaven, he became the guardian of the Moon gates. 1 \n\n1 .

They preyed on her enemies, the Brahmans. \nWomen had nothing to fear from the Thugs; their victims were only \nmen. 1 \n\nThuggee legend said Kali once tried to destroy all the "demons of \nblood and seed" (men) created by male gods. But each time she \nbeheaded one, another man sprang up from every drop of spilled blood, \nprobably a remnant of the belief that spilled blood in the Goddess\'s \n\n\n\n996 \n\n\n\nsanctuary brought forth increased fertility. At last Kali wiped the sweat \nfrom her arms with a handkerchief, gave the handkerchief to her \nfaithful followers, and told them to make it into cords to strangle the \n"demons" without bloodshed. \n\nMale human sacrifices were still offered to Kali up to the 16th \ncentury a.d., and occasionally even later, decapitation being the \nmethod of choice. A boy was beheaded at Kali\'s altar in Tanjore every \nFriday at sunset. 2 A king of Cooch Behar offered a hundred and fifty \nmen to Kali at Danteshvari in the 1 500s, and a king of Bastar sacrificed \ntwenty-five men at the same shrine in 1830. Human sacrifice was \nprohibited and replaced by animal sacrifice in 1835. \n\nLike medieval Arabian Assassins, the Thugs maintained that the \nrites of their Goddess should continue, and the Brahmans were \nheretics who deserved extermination. The Mahabharata presents Kali as \na spirit of Brahmanicide, "with teeth projecting terribly, of an aspect \nfuriously contorted, tawny and black, with disheveled hair, appalling \neyes, and a garland of skulls around her neck, bathed in blood, clad in \nrags and the bark of trees." 3 This probably represented a primitive idol \nof the Death-goddess whose devotees believed she must be bathed in \nblood to remain fertile and satisfied. \n\n1.

According to the Katha \nUpanishad, "That being, of the size of a thumb, dwells deep within \nthe heart. He is the lord of time, past and future." The belief was literal. \nThe sages actually thought a thumb-sized manikin danced inside the \nheart, stamping out the heartbeat, just as Dancing Shiva stamped out \nthe rhythm of the universe as he perpetually danced within the \ncosmic body of his consort. The crudity of the original belief now has to \nbe glossed over by modern commentators, who don\'t want their \nancient traditions to seem absurd. So the pious scholar writes, "The \nsages ascribe a definite, minute size to the Self in order to assist the \ndisciple in meditation." ! \n\nStill, the thumb-sized soul passed into European folklore and \nemerged as Hop-O\'-My-Thumb and the fairy Thumbelina, both of \nwhom probably began as disembodied souls in search of new bodies. \n\n1 .

Sometimes the thyrsus was displayed in \nconjunction with a wine cup, forming a male-and-female combina- \ntion like that of the royal scepter and orb. 1 \n\n1. Lamusse, 153. \n\n\n\nTiamat \n\nSumero-Babylonian "Goddess Mother" (Dia Mater), from whose \nformless body the universe was born at creation; personification of The \nDeep, or Tohu Bohu. Babylonians later claimed their municipal god \nMarduk, Tiamat\'s son, divided her into heavens above and earth below, \nas did Marduk\'s imitator, the biblical God. But the original division \nwas made by the Mother herself, as in the ancient Pelasgian myth of her \nAegean counterpart, Eurynome. 1 \n\nIn derivative Hebrew myths, Tiamat became Tehom, The Deep; \nand this is how she appears in the Bible (Genesis 1:2). Patriarchal \nwriters forgot that "The Deep" was a personified womb, a Middle- \nEastern version of Kali whose being before creation was "formless." \nMost creation myths incorporated the idea of formlessness, in the \ndarkness before the birth that brought "light" and the splitting of the \nMother\'s body, so she became both heaven and earth. The Bible\'s \naccount is based on the same archetype. \n\nIn Egypt, Tiamat was Temu or Te-Mut, oldest of deities, mother \nof the archaic Ennead of four dual female elements: Water, Dark- \nness, Night, and Eternity. 2 She was also Nun, Naunet, or Ma-Nu, the \ngreat fish who gave birth to the universe and the gods. In repeated \ncycles of becoming, she periodically swallowed up both gods and \nuniverses and gave them rebirth like Kali. 5 \n\nTiamat\'s firstborn child seems to have been a duplicate of herself, \nMummu, translated either "churning" or "mother." The combina- \ntion recalled the ancient notion that solid earth was made from \n"churning" the primordial fluid, like making butter from milk. 4 Some \nmyths gave Tiamat a male consort, Apsu, similar to Jupiter Pluvius: a \nFather Heaven whose job it was to fertilize the Mother\'s abyss with \nseminal rain. But he was not her superior, not even her equal. Even in \nthe chaotic conditions before creation, Tiamat was the true source of \nlife. Her consort was subordinate, not even very necessary. 5 Various \nmyths said Tiamat alone produced the fluid of creation, which was \nnot semen but her menstrual blood, flowing continuously for three years \nand three months. 6 Its great reservoir was the Red Sea comparable \nto Kali\'s "ocean of blood" the eastern shore of which is still called \nTihamat by the Arabs. \n\nBabylonians said their god Marduk divided his mother Tiamat into \ntwo parts, upper waters and lower waters. Likewise, the Jewish God \n\n\n\n998 \n\n\n\n"divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters Tiamat \n\nwhich were above the firmament" (Genesis 1:7). The Jewish God \n\nalso divided the Red Sea, which was likened to Tiamat herself. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe idea of dividing waters was not original with the Jews. \nGoddesses did it before gods. The Hindu Goddess Bindumati, \n"Mother of Life," divided the waters of the Ganges. 7 The Goddess Isis \ndivided the waters of the river Phaedrus, to cross dry-shod. 8 Even an \ninsignificant Egyptian wizard named Zazamonkh divided the waters of \na lake to retrieve a courtesan\'s lost pendant. 9 Yahweh\'s miracle on \nbehalf of the Israelites was fairly common in contemporary lore. \n\nBy dividing Tiamat, Marduk established the Diameter (horizon), \nwhich was the Greek version of Tiamat\'s name, meaning Goddess- \nMother. We still say a diameter divides a whole circle. Though Marduk \nwas supposed to have slain his mother, the Ocean of Blood, he still \nmaintained the menstrual calendar in Babylon, celebrating sabbaths and \nmonths of the year according to the moon\'s phases. 10 \n\nModern scholars tend to ignore Tiamat\'s maternal Creatress \nnature, describing her as nothing more than a "dragon of chaos" slain \nby Marduk. It is seldom emphasized that this was a myth of matricide, \nor that the Goddess was the one who created the world. Some \ntraditions indicate that Marduk\'s murder of his mother may have been \nmotivated by jealously, like Cain\'s murder of Abel. Mother Tiamat \nhad overlooked Marduk and chosen another of her sons, Kingu, to be \nher consort and the king of the universe. \n\n[She] exalted among the gods, her sons, that she had borne, Kingu, and \nmade him greatest among them all . . . placed him on a throne, saying, \n"By my charm and incantation I have raised thee to power among the \ngods. The dominion over all the gods I intrusted to thee. Lofty thou \nshalt be, thou my chosen spouse; great be thy name in all the world. " She \nthen gave him the Tablets of Destiny, and laid them on his breast. " \n\nJealous Marduk not only killed Tiamat; he also deposed, castrat- \ned, and killed Kingu, and made the first man on earth out of Kingu\'s \nblood which tends to show that Kingu was once the name of the \nsacrificed god-king, whose blood had the "feminine" power to make \nlife. 12 Kingu was identified with the moon. Chaldeans called him Sin, \nthe Moon-god of Mount Sinai. Apparently he still had the tablets of the \nLaw given him by Tiamat (as Mother Rhea gave sacred tablets of the \nLaw to Minos on Mt. Dicte), for the Old Testament claims he passed \nthem on to Moses. \n\nIn southern Arabia, the Goddess was assimilated to Ishtar. The \neyes of her idol Tehama were said to flow with tears each year as she \nbewailed the death of Tammuz. 13 \n\nI. Graves, CM. 1, 27. 2. Budge, D.N., 21 1. 3.

The idea came from a \ngeneral Asiatic belief in cyclic recurrences brought about by the \nGoddess (Kali), herself the cauldron or sea of "infinite formlessness," \nholding all potential forms in a plastic state of flux. 1 She was the \nAbyss or the Deep before creation, according to the Bible (Genesis 1:2). \n\nChaldean sources of the Bible myth said the brooding creative \nspirit that brought order out of chaos was the Goddess; but patriarchal \nwriters transformed her into the "Spirit of God." 2 Tohu bohu was her \nsemi-fluid substance, menstrual blood in the process of clotting into \nsolidity; the sea, but also a sea of blood. Orphics called it "Chaos eternal, \nimmense, uncreated, from which all is born; neither darkness nor \nlight, nor damp nor dry, nor hot nor cold, but all things mingled, \neternally one and limitless." 3 Some scholars have identified tohu with \nthe Primordial Sea, the Goddess Tiamat (Hebrew Tehomet), and bohu \nwith the male earth god Behemoth, making "a sexual creation." 4 \n\nl.Avalon,229,233. 2.

(See Vagina Dentata.) \n\nAt the moment of her mating with Shiva, Kali Ma usually showed \na protruding tongue in token of the sexual sacrament. 1 The classic \nMedusa head signifying "female wisdom" also had a protruding tongue, \na reference to ancient sexual mysteries celebrated in her honor. 2 \n\nMedieval Christians understood very well that the protruding \ntongue was a sexual symbol. Their pictures of lusty devils showed \nlong phallic tongues, and sticking out the tongue "at" someone became \ntheir favorite gesture of insult, equivalent to "fuck you." In the east, \nwhere sexuality was not associated with shame or dishonor, sticking out \nthe tongue is still considered a polite greeting. \n\nItalians used to heighten the mouth\'s resemblance to a vulva by \ndrawing down one corner of it with the thumb. 3 Biting the thumb, a \nsupreme insult in Italy, cast a curse of castration. \n\nArchaic sacred kings, who had to kill their "fathers" or predeces- \nsors to win the queen, often castrated the defeated rival to deprive his \nghost of virtu (man-magic) which might give him enough power to \nreturn for revenge. This Oedipal attack was often mythologized as \nthe slaying of a dragon, symbol of "father," or "phallus bigger than \nmine." The dragon-slayer\'s reward was the woman (mother). Drag- \non-slaying heroes cut off the dragon\'s tongue, representing amputation \nof the penis. Tristan cut off the tongue of his slain dragon, to establish \nhis right to demand the hand of Iseult. 4 \n\nIn medieval cathedrals, "an extraordinary number of grotesque \nheads are depicted with protruding tongues," and this was distinctly \nrelated to exposure of sexual organs. "The exposure of the genitalia was \nwidely believed to thwart and keep at bay pursuing evil forces." 5 All \nover the Gothic cathedral, numerous creatures with their tongues \nsticking out showed once again that the cathedral was dedicated to a \npantheon of both Christian and pagan deities. People wanted their \n"creatures from the grotto" ox grotesques to inhabit the same \nchurches that were built over the sites of the old grottoes. By Renais- \nsance times, the old deities with their obscenely protruding tongues \nwere declared devils, so it became conventional to show devils making \nthis gesture. 6 \n\nThe story of Pinocchio\'s nose, which grew every time he told a lie, \n\nmay have originated in Oriental beliefs concerning the tongue. \n\nBuddhists said a liar\'s tongue would grow to great length in hell. 7 The \n\nBuddhists called "liars" most of the old non-Buddhist deities who \n\nstuck out their tongues in token of the sexual sacrament. \n\n1.

The previous source was probably the Egyptian Tephet, "Hid- \nden abode," a part of the underworld. 1 \n\nAt the Tophet altar, victims "passed through the fire to eternal \nlife," meaning they were burned to death and rose again as gods. For \na while, Molech was identified with Yahweh, which is why the sons of \nAaron were consumed on the altar by "fire from the Lord" (Leviti- \ncus 10:2). Norse heroes also passed through "magic fire" to reach the \nparadise of the Valkyries. Jewish surrogate-kings were still burned for \nthe Lord in Hilkiah\'s reign (2 Kings 23: 10). 2 \n\nLevite priests eventually distinguished Yahweh from Molech and \nforbade the latter\'s worship (Leviticus 18:21); but the cult of Hera- \ncles-Melkart still flourished in St. Paul\'s time in Paul\'s own home town \nof Tarsus. 3 Because victims burned in this "Tophet" were deified as \nholy martyrs, Paul thought there was a special magic in giving one\'s \nbody to be burned (1 Corinthians 1 3:3). \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 1,230. 2. James, 192. 3. H. Smith, 182. \n\n\n\nTorture \n\nDuring the Middle Ages, torture became the common accompani- \nment to legal cases involving matters of faith. Pagan common-law \ntraditions opposed the use of torture, and regarded an accused person \nas innocent until proven guilty by the prosecution. 1 Christian crusaders \nand inquisitors reversed this trend. (See Inquisition.) The Inquisi- \ntion\'s use of torture removed all possibility of proof of innocence. \nGibbon said, "No power under heaven could save the prisoner; he \nwas doomed." Weyer, an eyewitness, wrote that the inquisitors\' victims \nwere "slaughtered with the most refined tortures that tyrants could \ninvent, beyond human endurance. And this cruelty is continued until \nthe most innocent are forced to confess themselves guilty." 2 \n\nSurviving records, though scanty, paint a hideous picture of the \nInquisition\'s activities, which were sometimes disbelieved even by \nicontemporaries because they were unimaginable. A woman arrested at \nEichstatt in 1637 "laughed heartily" on the first day of her trial at the \nidea that she might have trafficked with the devil. She said she would \nrather die than accuse herself of such doings; she had lived a \njblameless life with her husband and eight children for more than 20 \nyears. Three weeks later, she died under the torture, confessing that \nhe was in love with the devil, that she killed one of her children at his \nbidding, and that at least 45 of her neighbors were fellow-Satanists. 3 \n\nNot even the most saintly had a chance against the inquisitors\' \nhngines. A 16th-century abbess of the convent of Santa Isabela at \n\n\n\n1003 \n\n\n\nTorture \n\n\n\nCordova, Magdalena de la Cruz, was a woman of "an extraordinary \nreputation for sanctity." Nevertheless she was accused and arrested, \nand soon confessed to practicing witchcraft with the help of two familia \ndemons, Balbar and Pithon. 4 \n\nThe inquisitors\' rule was to keep on torturing until the victim \nnamed many "accomplices," who were then arrested and tortured \nuntil more names were given, and so on until whole districts were foun \nto be "infected" with heresy. One woman told her confessor: "I \nnever dreamed that by means of the torture a person could be brought \nto the point of telling such lies as I have told. I am not a witch, and I \nhave never seen the devil, and still I had to plead guilty myself and \ndenounce others." One minister urged a condemned witch to re- \nnounce her accusations of innocent people, but she answered, "Father, \nlook at my legs! They are like fire ready to burn up so excruciat- \ning is the pain. I could not stand to have so much as a fly touch them, t< \nsay nothing of submitting again to the torture. I would a hundred \ntimes rather die than endure such frightful agony again. I cannot \ndescribe to any human being how terrific the pain actually is." 5 Such \ntorture was "extensively, viciously, and persistently used and could \nbreak all but the most heroic spirits." 6 \n\nWeyer served as a physician in witch prisons and spoke from first- \nhand knowledge of women driven half mad "by frequent torture . . . \nkept in prolonged squalor and darkness of their dungeons . . . and \nconstantly dragged out to undergo atrocious torment until they would \ngladly exchange at any moment this most bitter existence for death, are \nwilling to confess whatever crimes are suggested to them rather than \nbe thrust back into their hideous dungeon amid ever recurring torture.\' \nFriedrich von Spee, a Jesuit confessor who also worked in the prisons, \nwrote: "All recantation is vain. If she does not confess, the torture is \nrepeated twice, thrice, four times. In \'exceptional\' crimes, the \ntorture is not limited in duration, severity, or frequency. . . . She can \nnever clear herself. The investigating body would feel disgraced if it \nacquitted a woman; once arrested and in chains, she has to be guilty, by \nfair means or foul." 7 \n\nThis might be contrasted with the old law of the Ripuarian Franks \nthat any man who killed a woman for any reason whatever must pay a \nfine so heavy that it obligated his descendants for three generations. 8 \n\nMotherhood was a distinct liability for those who fell into inquisi- \ntors\' hands. Bodin recommended that children, if "craftily handled," \ncould be depended on to inform against their mothers. Children were \nalso highly susceptible to torture; so a rule was made that children \ncould be tortured at once, without any waiting period. Elicited by \ntorture or by craft, the testimony of "infants" meaning children \nunder 10 was acceptable to the Inquisition and could convict their \nmothers of witchcraft, even though such testimony was not accepted \nin other kinds of trials. 9 \n\nRules for the persecution of witches allowed no revocation of \n\n\n\n1004 \n\n\n\nconfessions after torture. Those who tried to retract their confessions Torture \n\nwere taken back to the torture chamber and tortured again; once to \n\npurge themselves of the retraction, and once again to elicit a "true" ^^^^^^^^^^^ m \n\nconfession. Any display of fear was proof of guilt. So was denunciation \nby another tortured victim. In 1 597 a 69-year-old woman named \nClara Geissler manage to resist the thumbscrew, but confessed every- \nthing she had been asked after racking and crushing of her feet. \nWhen those she named had been arrested and similarly tortured, Clara \nwas returned to the torture chamber to confirm their confessions. She \nwas tortured with "the utmost severity," and died. The record stated \nthat the devil had wrung her neck. 10 \n\nIn some cases of retracted confessions, the court automatically \nassumed that the confession was true, and the retraction a perjury. \nThe victim was then declared a relapsed impenitent, and handed over to \nthe stake. 11 \n\nInquisitors were instructed by their handbooks to give false prom- \nises of mercy for the sake of compliance and confession. 12 There was \nno need to keep any promises to an accused witch. If a victim confessed \neverything, abjured her heresy, and threw herself on the court\'s \nmercy, her sentence was carried out anyway, on two counts: (1) for the \n"temporal injuries" she had caused, and (2) for the worthlessness of \nher confession which was made "from fear of death" rather than from \ntrue repentance. 15 The same "worthless" confession, though, was a \nlegal basis for execution. \n\nDenial of guilt was useless, even if it could be maintained against \ntortures. Le Sieur Bouvet declared that "denial of guilt by a prisoner \nwas an especially good reason why torture should be continued." \nLimborch\'s History of the Inquisition said it was a simple matter to \nextort confession by torture from "such as are most innocent." Accord- \ning to Cornelius Loos, "Wretched creatures are compelled by the \nseverity of the torture to confess things they have never done, and so by \ncruel butchery innocent lives are taken and by a new alchemy gold \nand silver coined from human blood." Von Spee wrote, "The most \nrobust who have thus suffered have affirmed to me that no crime can \nbe imagined which they would not at once confess, if it would bring \never so little relief, and they would welcome ten deaths to escape a \nrepetition." H \n\nRecords of the Spanish Inquisition at Toledo show that some \nvictims were prevented from confessing until the lust of their tormen- \ntors had been gratified. Their torture went on for days or weeks beyond \nthe point where they had wholly broken down, and pleaded to be told \nwhat to say, so they could say it. 15 Such evidence shows that the \nInquisition really was a system of formalized sadism. The fact that the \nvast majority of its victims were women points to crypto-sexual motiva- \ntions engendered by repression on a massive scale. \n\nPope Alexander III said in an encyclical letter that confessions \nshould not be forced by torture. His successors took it upon themselves \n\n\n\n1005 \n\n\n\nTorture to explain that what Alexander really meant was that torture must not \n\nbe used against clergymen by lay persons; but it could be used by the \n\n^^^^^ clergy against laymen. When Innocent IV adopted torture for eccle- \n\n^ siastical trials, he said it should "stop short of loss of life or limb," but thi: \n\nwas a mere formality, since limbs were broken or crushed routinely in \nthe torture chamber. When a victim died under torture, inquisitors were \nauthorized by Pope Urban IV to absolve each other from guilt, to be \ninnocent in the sight of God. 16 \n\nMany semantic devices were used to convey an official impression \nthat the inquisitors were not monsters of cruelty. Records often said \nconfessions were given freely, sine tortura et extra locum torturae \n"without torture and even out of sight of the instruments of torture." \nThis meant that after the victims were tortured, they were carried into \nanother room and given the choice of confessing "freely" or being \ntaken back to the torture chamber. 17 \n\nWhen victims managed to kill themselves in prison, or died of thei \ninjuries, they were said to have been slain by the devil. One victim \nwho succeeded in cutting his own throat was described by Friar Guazzc \nas "tempted by a demon," which carried away his soul, "for so did \nDivine Justice dispose." 18 Few victims were allowed an opportunity to \nkill themselves, for they were closely chained at night; but they could \neasily be devoured by the rats and other prison-infesting vermin attract- \ned by the smell of blood and suppurating wounds. 19 \n\nMost victims pleaded for death sooner or later, but pious ones \nwere further tormented by visions of the hellfire that awaited them, \ndying with lies on their lips. A housewife named Rebecca Lemp ser \nletters from prison to her husband and six children, showing radical \nalterations in her attitude before and after torture. At first she was \nconfident: "My dearly beloved Husband, be not troubled. Were I to be \ncharged by thousands of accusations, I am innocent, else may all the \ndemons in hell come and tear me to pieces. Were they to pulverize me, \ncut me in a thousand pieces, I could not confess anything. Therefore \ndo not be alarmed; before my conscience and before my soul I am \ninnocent. Will I be tortured? I don\'t believe it, since I am not guilty \nof anything." \n\nAfter she had been tortured five times, and had confessed every \nenormity her tormentors suggested to her, Rebecca wrote again to \nher husband: "O thou, the chosen of my heart, must I be parted from \nthee, though entirely innocent? If so, may God be followed through- \nout eternity by my reproaches. They force one and make one confess; \nthey have so tortured me. . . . Husband, send me something that I \nmay die, or I must expire under the torture. . . . Send me something, \nelse may I peril even my soul." 20 \n\nAnother letter smuggled out of the Bamberg prison in 1628 was \nwritten by a man of means, Burgomaster Johannes Junius, whose \nproperty was taken by the inquisitors: \n\nMany hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica. \n\n\n\n1006 \n\n\n\nInnocent have I come into prison, innocent have I been tortured, Torture \n\ninnocent must I die. For whoever comes into the witch prison must \n\nbecome a witch or be tortured until he invents something out of his ^^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\nhead and God pity him bethinks him of something. I will tell you how \n\nit has gone with me. . . . The executioner put the thumb screws on me, \n\nboth hands bound together, so that the blood ran out at the nails and \n\neverywhere, so that for four weeks I could not use my hands, as you \n\ncan see from the writing .... Thereafter they first stripped me, bound my \n\nhands behind me, and drew me up in the torture. Then I thought \n\nheaven and earth were at an end; eight times did they draw me up and let \n\nme fall again, so that I suffered terrible agony. The executioner said, \n\n"Sir, I beg you, for God\'s sake confess something, whether it be true or \n\nnot. Invent something, for you cannot endure the torture which you \n\nwill be put to, and even if you bear it all, yet you will not escape. "... \n\nNow, dear child, here you have all my confession, for which I must die. \n\nAnd they are sheer lies and made-up things, so help me God. For all this I \n\nwas forced to say through fear of the torture which was threatened \n\nbeyond what I had already endured. For they never leave off with the \n\ntorture till one confesses something; be he never so good, he must be a \n\nwitch. Nobody escapes. . . . Dear child, keep this letter secret so that \n\npeople do not find it, else I shall be tortured most piteously and the \n\njailers will be beheaded. So strictly is it forbidden. . . . I have taken several \n\ndays to write this; my hands are both lame. lam in a sad plight. Good \n\nnight, for your father Johannes Junius will never see you more. . . . Dear \n\nchild, six have confessed against me at once . . . all false, through \n\ncompulsion, as they told me, and begged my forgiveness in God\'s name \n\nbefore they were executed. 2 \' \n\nTorture was euphemistically called "the Question." Making a \nshow of mercy, handbooks of the Inquisition recommended that the \naccused be questioned at first "lightly, without shedding of blood." 22 \nSometimes this elicited full confessions. A witch in the diocese of \nConstance confessed to having raised a hailstorm by pouring water \ninto a small hole in the ground after she "had at first been exposed to \nthe very gentlest questions, being suspended hardly clear of the \nground by her thumbs." 25 \n\nOther methods, not quite so gentle, included the rack, thumb- \nscrew, bootscrew, whips, branding irons, pincers for twisting off \ngobbets of flesh, ropes to wind the extremities until blood spurted from \nunder the nails. A favorite of the judges was the hoist or strappado, a \npulley to haul the victim into the air by her arms bound behind her \nback, jerking her up and down until the shoulders were dislocated. \nThe water torture was also common. This consisted of forcing gallons of \nwater into the belly through a funnel put down the throat, sometimes \nalso forcing down and pulling up long strips of linen along with the \nwater, or paddling the distended belly with sticks. Feet or hands \nmight be basted with boiling fat and roasted over a brazier. 24 Most of the \ninstruments were inscribed with the pious motto: Soli Deo Gloria, \nGlory be only to God. 25 \n\nDr. Johann Meyfarth witnessed hundreds of witch trials in the \n\n\n\n1007 \n\n\n\nTorture 1 7th century and wrote that he would have given a thousand thalers \n\nto be able to forget what he had seen: "feet wrenched off legs, and eyes \n^^^^^^^^^ torn from their sockets, and the prisoner burned with brimstone and \n^ ^^^ m basted with oil. He had seen torturers apply flaming balls of brimstone to \nthe genitals of a woman while she was hanging in strappado. He had \nwatched them revel in horror until their victims confessed or died \n(strangled by the Devil, the judges explained)." 26 \n\nExecution was still another torture, sometimes miserably protract- \ned, as in Spain where half-burned heretics were snatched from the \nflames, still alive, and allowed to suffer for hours before being returned \nto the fire. At the "Witches\' Tower" in Hesse, victims were hung 1 5 \nfeet above ground in niches, and slowly baked to death over a low fire. \nNumerous burned bones and skulls were found buried at the base of \nthe tower. 27 Oddly enough, the tower later became the property of the \nnovelist Sacher-Masoch, who gave his name to the perversion known \nas masochism. 28 \n\nA significant detail, speaking psychologically, was that inquisitors \nseemed very anxious to make women cry. It was their rule that a \nwitch was proved guilty if she didn\'t shed tears during torture. The \njudge adjured her to weep, "by the loving tears shed by Christ on the \ncross." If she did weep, though, she went to the stake anyway, for it \nproved the devil had given her the gift of tears to mislead the \njudges. 29 If she didn\'t weep, she was convicted of "taciturnity," a crime \npunishable by burning. In England, the punishment for taciturnity \nwas peine fort et dure pressing to death. 30 \n\nEngland didn\'t import the engines of torture used on the conti- \nnent, but Scotland did. English witch-finders used informal or \nbloodless tortures like starvation, "swimming the witch," or "walking \nthe witch" (preventing her from sleeping until a confession was \nmade). 31 Various binding tortures were used. An accused witch might \nbe stripped and bound cross-legged on a table, sometimes with ropes \naround the neck attached to the four corners of the room, and left in \nthat position until she confessed. Sometimes, accused witches were so \ntightly manacled in jail while awaiting trial, that they came to the \ncourtroom with limbs rotted by gangrene. Many died of "gaol fever" \n(typhus) before they could be tried at all. \n\nSwimming the witch was a relic of the ordeal by water. With \nthumbs bound to the opposite big toes, the victim was lowered into a \nstream or pond by men holding ropes, one on each bank. If the body \nfloated, witchcraft was proved, on the theory that water rejected a \nwitch. If the body sank, the accused was innocent, although frequently \ndead of drowning. The decision was largely dependent on the men \nwho held the ropes. \n\nPeasant mobs often invented their own tortures for suspected \nwitches. At Catton in Suffolk in 1603, a mob of men tossed an 80- \nyear-old woman up in the air, punched her, flashed gunpowder in her \nface, and "having prepared a stool in the which they had stuck \n\n\n\n1008 \n\n\n\ndaggers and knives with sharp points upwards, they often times struck Torture \n\nher down upon the same stool whereby she was sore pricked and \n\ngrievously hurt." 32 ^^^^^im \n\n"Pricking" was the favorite technique of witch-finders who \nclaimed to locate the giveaway witch mark or "devil\'s mark" on a \nwitch\'s body by sticking a three-inch awl into her flesh. The devil\'s mark \nwas supposed to be a numb spot, so the pricking would produce no \npain. Most witch-finders used a trick instrument with a retractable blade, \nlike a stage dagger, to find the "painless" spot. 33 Scottish prickers \nformed a regular guild. Among the more famous of them were John \nBain, John Balfour, John Kincaid the "common pricker," and Mat- \nthew Hopkins, who pricked hundreds of old women in the country of \nSuffolk, and soon announced that the entire area was infested with \nwitches. 34 \n\nThe search for the mark was not necessarily definitive, if it failed. \nWhen the Bavarian witch-finder Jorg Abriel couldn\'t find the mark \non a woman, he simply said she looked like a witch to him, and went on \nto torture her into admitting it. 35 \n\nGrim Calvinist Scotland instituted tortures as nasty as the conti- \nnental ones, though the persecution was less, because the church \nmade no profit from it. Perhaps the most famous Scottish witch trial was \nconducted in the presence of King James VI (James 1 of England), \nwho was convinced the witches had caused a storm at sea that nearly \nwrecked his ship, and badly frightened him. The record said they had \ndone it by throwing a dead cat into the sea. They also set sail on the sea \nin a sieve. 36 \n\nThe alleged ringleader of the "coven" was Dr. John Fian, a \nschoolmaster, who displayed exemplary courage in the face of multi- \nple tortures, but his courage did him no good. "His nails upon all his \nfingers were riven and pulled off with an instrument called in Scottish \na turkas, which in England we call a pair of pincers, and under every \nnail there was thrust in two needles." He was subjected to "thrawing" \n(binding the head tightly with a rope), tongue-pricking, and three \nsessions in the boots. He "did abide so many blows in them, that his \nlegs were crushed and beaten together as small as might be, and the \nbones and flesh so bruised, that the blood and marrow spouted forth \nin great abundance, whereby they were made unserviceable for ever." 37 \nHe was carried to the stake on a cart. 38 \n\nThe memory of this martyr to superstition was sullied by a \nrather bawdy tale that arose after his death. Dr. Fian was said to have \ncraved the love of a village maiden, and bribed her brother to obtain \nthree of her pubic hairs for a love charm. The boy was caught by his \nmother, who substituted three hairs from a cow\'s udder. Dr. Fian \naccepted these and made his love charm, after which he was pursued \nthrough the village by a roaring, lovesick cow. 39 \n\nThrough its history, western civilization has been disgraced by \nspectacles of formalized infliction of pain upon the helpless. Such \n\n\n\n1009 \n\n\n\nTorture spectacles are even artificially contrived in modern "entertainment," \n\nsuch as films. G. B. Shaw remarked, "A public flogging will always \n____^^_^_ draw a crowd; and there will be in that crowd plenty of manifestations of \na horrible passional ecstasy in the spectacle of laceration and suffer- \ning."\' 40 Sometimes it was so blatant as to embarrass even participants. \nWhen Protestants abolished the bloody sport of bear-baiting in \nEngland, they gave as their reason not that it was cruel to bears and \ndogs, but that it afforded too much pleasure to the spectators. 41 \n\nAnimals and women were perennial victims, even equated with \none another by churchmen who claimed both were devoid of souls. \nAmong the most savagely tormented were women suspected of enjoy- \ning their sexuality witches, whores, adulteresses. The latter received \npublic floggings in colonial America: "Public whippings yielded a \nvicarious sexual experience a mixture of sadism and mass voyeur- \nism cloaked in righteous disapproval. . . . They gathered on such \noccasions to watch as a woman convicted of uncontrolled desire \nbared her back down to the waist and was whipped by a man with a kind \nof erotic violence later made notorious by the Comte de Sade." 42 \n\nWestern civilization came to choose pain over pleasure: to think \npain-giving permissible, fit for public display, even pious, whereas \npleasure-giving of the physical sort was suspect, hidden, "evil." The two \ntypes of behavior seem to be inversely related. If a society suppresses \none, the other will flourish. Studies with laboratory animals show that \nindividuals conditioned to be highly aggressive have below-normal \nsex drive and display little interest in copulation. It has also been \nobserved among human beings that angry, hostile individuals have \nlittle sexual appetite. 43 \n\nSexually repressed individuals abounded in western society, espe- \ncially in the church, which spawned the Inquisition. There were also \nless extreme manifestations of the evil. Doctors lauded the salutary \neffects of pain. Paullini\'s Flagellum Salutis ( 1 698) recommended \nsevere beatings for "quick and easy cures" of such disorders as melan- \ncholia, paralysis, toothache, sleepwalking, deafness, and \nnymphomania. Professor Cullen at Edinburgh taught that "stripes and \nblows about the body" help cure maniacs. John Battie, another expert \non the care of the insane, wrote: "Body pain may be excited to purpose \nand without the least danger. Beating is often serviceable." 44 \n\nAmong the most curious manifestations of western man\'s pain- \nobsession was its projection upon women as the givers of pain, almost \nas if man collectively sought punishment for his historical offenses \nagainst females. Flagellation was remarkably popular among Victori- \nan "puritans." Publisher George Cannon called flagellation "a letch \nwhich has existed from time immemorial, and is so extensively \nindulged in London at this day that no less than twenty splendid \nestablishments are supported entirely by its practice." 45 One writer \nsaid, "Lovers of the birch ... are almost as common as the lovers of \nVenus." 46 \n\n\n\n1010 \n\n\n\nBut it was Venus who wielded the birch: usually a mother image, Torture \n\nstepmother, aunt, governess, housekeeper, or a large, imposing sort \n\nof courtesan. Swinburne said, "One of the great charms of birching lies ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nin the sentiment that the floggee is the powerless victim of the furious \nrage of a beautiful woman." St. George H. Stock wrote: "When an \nelegant high bred woman wields the birch with dignity of mein and \ngrace of attitude, then both the practice and suffering becomes a real \npleasure." Dugdale published a pornographic book entitled Betsy \nThoughtless, "a most spicey [sic] and piquant Narrative of a Young Girl \nobliged to excoriate her sweetheart\'s bum before he could ravish her \nMaidenhead." 47 A typical passage of Victorian "spice" ran: \n\nMartinet meanwhile had taken off her loose morning wrapper, and armed \nherself with a rod, formed, not of canes and cuttings like the rest, but of \nstout birch stems with innumerable branches, like a tree in miniature. \nWith this weapon in her hand, how terrible she appeared! Juno \ndeprived of the apple might have looked like her. Her splendid neck and \narms were bare, her cheeks flamed, her huge breasts were heaving. \nSpeech was too weak, the graces of birching were ignored, nothing short \nof savage beating would satisfy her present need of vengeance. * 8 \n\nWas this a vision of woman wronged or Goddess ignored \nthrough centuries of oppression, surfacing in pornography which by \nits very simplicity may give expression to genuinely archetypal imag- \nery? These books were written by men, not women. They presented \nfantasies that men wanted to see in the mind\'s eye. In one porno- \ngraphic work, a young man was beaten for insulting his mother, by an \nolder woman presented as a "nurse" ordinarily, a nurturer or \ncaretaker. Her bizarre speech ran: "The young gentleman thought, I \ndare swear, there was no one could break him of those crimes, but I\'ll \nwhip this bold backside of his till I strip every bit of skin off it, or I\'ll work \nan amendment in him." The youth pleaded, "Try me this once, my \ndearest mistress! Oh gracious! Try me! Oh, I\'m killed! let me down! let \nme down! nurse! nurse! nurse!" She answered, "You may roar, and \ncry, and kick, and plunge, and implore, my pretty gentleman, but all will \nnot do; I\'ll whip you till the blood runs to your heels! You shall feel \nthe tuition of this excellent rod!" 49 \n\nWilliam Gladstone, four times prime minister of England, regular- \nly indulged in flagellation and patronized brothels for the purpose, as \nwas discovered when his diaries were published in 1975. 50 Of course, \nEnglish public-school customs of hazing and caning created many \nunfortunates whose sexual drives were warped into a confusion between \npleasure and pain; the poet Swinburne presents a well-known exam- \nple. But a tradition even older had predisposed all Christendom to this \nkind of confusion. The sense of sin and guilt attached to all forms of \nsexuality; the ubiquitous image of a tortured Christ revered for his \nsuffering (inflicted on him by Father); the generally accepted theory \nthat children must be trained to "fear God" through painful punish- \nments many such things together established a culture of cruelty, \n\n\n\n1011 \n\n\n\nTransubstantiation where men often judged their own success in life by their level of ability \n\nto make others suffer. This was the real meaning of power. \n\n_^^^^^^^^^_ Psychologically, men who obviously enjoyed torturing women anc \n\nchildren revealed their own incapacity to inspire love. Sadists find \nsadistic behavior satisfying because it can elicit strong emotional re- \nsponses from people who would otherwise pay no attention to them. \nA sadist doesn\'t know how to be lovable. This feeling of powerlessness \ncan be transformed into a feeling of power if he can torture. He can \neven achieve something like a sense of bravery or daring, despite the \nfact that the victim has no opportunity to retaliate. To subject others \nto any violent physical attack is to defy their rage. When such rage is \nmade completely helpless to express itself, as in the case of a prisoner, \nthe victim becomes an object of total control which is precisely what \nmen yearned to make of women ever since patriarchal thought \nintroduced the possibility. \n\nSadism has been called the religion of psychical cripples. 51 It was \nalso a religion of sexual cripples. Unable to reconcile their concept of \nsin with the tenderness and affection that good sexual relatedness \nrequires, Christians turned to perverted obsessions with pain and \npunishment. Western historians were fond of describing the barbarian \ncruelties of the ancient pagan world, as contrasted with a "Christian" \nmorality of kindness. However, it might appear that of the two ap- \nproaches to morality, paganism was the kinder one on the whole. At \nleast its cruelty was never so mercilessly efficient as that of western \ncivilization, extending from the Inquisition to the wars and concen- \ntration camps of the 20th century. \n\n1.

Rationalists like Cicero objected to ^^^^^^^^^^ \nthe practice: "When we call the corn Ceres and the wine Bacchus we \nuse a common figure of speech; but do you imagine that any one is so \ninsane as to believe that the thing he feeds upon is a god?" Yet the \nvulgar did indeed believe it, transforming the ancient omophagia into \ngrain-flesh and wine-blood of the god who might carry them into \nheaven when he became a part of them. Jesus repeated the same claim \nas all other savior gods: "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my \nblood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day." 2 \n\nThe theory behind transubstantiation was the most primitive kind \nof magic, "the echo of some prehistoric cannibalistic religion. . . . \nThe flesh and blood consumed becomes an innate part of the diner. \nThus, if a man feeds on a stag, some measure of the animal\'s \nswiftness becomes a part of his own skill; if he drinks the blood of a \nwarrior, he acquires the warrior\'s power and strength." 3 If he eats a \ngod, he becomes godlike. \n\nLiteral belief in the conversion of bread and wine into Jesus\'s flesh \nand blood was essential to the idea of salvation, which Christianity \nshared with the pagan Mysteries. Doubt on this point was not tolerated. \nSt. Gregory the Great told of a woman who dared laugh at the \nEucharist, explaining to Gregory, "I laughed because you called this \nmorsel of bread, which I kneaded with my own hands, the \'Body of \nChrist.\'" Gregory then prayed, and caused the host lying on the altar to \nbe changed into "a piece of flesh in the form of a finger." This \nconvinced the woman, who then ate the bread she had just seen turned \ninto a finger, and came back to the faith. 4 \n\nEven today, those who tried to reinterpret the Eucharist as a purely \nsymbolic act have been rebuked ex cathedra by the pope. The 1965 \nencyclical Mysterium Fidei once again insisted on "the marvelous \nchange of the whole of the bread\'s substance into Christ\'s body and \nthe whole of the wine\'s substance into his blood." Having never \nwavered on this point, churchmen were curiously inconsistent, to say \nthe least, in condemning converted Mexican Indians for secretly con- \ntinuing their "great heresy and abominable sin," which consisted of \nmaking "dough images of their god which were distributed and eaten." 5 \n\nTransubstantiation was one of the primary doctrinal causes of the \nProtestant Reformation. John Huss and his colleague Jerome of \nPrague went to the stake for denying it, but their martyrdom set off the \nwar between the papacy and the Bohemian heretics, which ended \nwith the church\'s loss of all Bohemia and the foundation of the \nindependent Moravian church. 6 Protestants eventually developed \ncontempt for Catholic "God-eaters." Heath\'s 1610 Epigrammes called \nthem worse than cannibals, who committed only the lesser sin of \neating man\'s flesh. 7 Both factions, perhaps dimly recalling pagan ver- \nsions of transubstantiation, viewed witches as cannibals. "Where the \n\n\n\n1013 \n\n\n\nTransvestism basic internal social divisions are between the generations or sexes, \n\nwomen and children are often cast as witches and cannibals by the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ dominant males." 8 \n\nThere was much satisfaction in pagan communion feasts where \nthe god was incarnate in an edible animal and distributed even to the \npoor, who seldom enjoyed any meat of their own. But the church came \nto regard this kind of feast as too expensive. "The point that really \nmerits attention is that the nutritive value of the communion feast is \nvirtually zero, whether there is transubstantiation or not. . . . What \nthe end of animal sacrifice really signified was the end of ecclesiastical \nredistributive feasting." 9 \n\n1. Robertson, 27. 2. H. Smith, 168, 200. 3. Jobes, 219. 4. de Voragine, 185. \n5.

A common method was to put on women\'s clothes. \n\nTransvestism is found in a majority of ancient priesthoods. Tacitus \nsaid the priests of Germanic tribes were muliebri ornatu, men dressed \nup as women. 1 Norse priests of sunrise and sunset rituals in honor of the \nHaddingjar (Heavenly Twins) were men whose office demanded that \nthey wear the dress and hair styles of women. 2 Even Thor, the thunder \ngod, received his magic hammer and was filled with power only after \nhe put on the garments of the Goddess Freya and pretended to be a \nbride. 5 \n\nAt the ancient Argive "Feast of Wantonness" (Hubristika) men \nbecame women by wearing women\'s dresses and veils, temporarily \nassuming feminine powers in violation of a specific taboo. 4 Cretan \npriests of Leukippe, the White-Mare-Mother, always wore female \ndress. So did priests of Heracles, ostensibly in memory of their god\'s \nservice (in female dress) to the Lydian Goddess Omphale, personifi- \ncation of the omphalos} The Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides \nsaid men in his day put on women\'s clothing to invoke the aid of the \nGoddess Venus. 6 \n\nRoman priests of the Magna Mater dressed as women, and \ntransvestism figured prominently in Roman rites of the Lupercalia \nand the Ides of January. The custom was still prevalent in the time of St. \nAugustine, who inveighed against men who clothed themselves in \nwomen\'s garments at the feast of Janus. He said such men could not \nattain salvation, even if they were otherwise good Christians. Before \nhis conversion to Christianity, St. Jerome even participated in ritual \ntransvestism, though his biographers tried to pretend that he had \nworn women\'s clothes by mistake. 7 \n\n\n\n1014 \n\n\n\nDespite Augustine and other church fathers, ritual transvestism Transvestism \n\ncontinued. Men dressed in women\'s clothes at religious festivals at \n\nAmasea in the 5 th century, and again or still at the Kalends of ^^^^^^^^i \n\nJanuary in the 10th century. Balsamon said in the 12th century even \nthe clergy participated in pagan rites in the nave of the church, wearing \nmasks and female dress. 8 Gregory of Tours, bishop of Auvergne in \nMerovingian times, was forced to give up his church to a crowd of \n"demons," their leader dressed as a woman and seated on the \nepiscopal throne. 9 The inquisitor Jean Bodin asserted that male and \nfemale witches actually changed their sex by changing clothes with \none another. 10 \n\nMen\'s transvestism was rooted in the ancient desire to imitate \nfemale magic. In the Celebes, religious rituals remained in the hands \nof women, assisted by an order of priests who wore female dress and \nwere called tjalabai, "imitation women." The same word was applied \nin Arabia to the robe that men copied from women, djallaba. n Among \nthe northern Batak the shaman is always a woman, and the office is \nhereditary in the female line, because there was no transvestism. 12 In \nBorneo, magicians are required to wear female clothing. Siberian \nshamans often wore women\'s clothes. Considered greatest were those \nshamans who could "change their sex" and become female, taking \nhusbands and living as homosexual wives. 13 \n\nSimilarly, American Indians viewed the homosexual or berdache \nas a gifted medicine man. He claimed to receive an order from the \nMoon-goddess in a dream, to the effect that he must turn female and \nbecome one of her own. He was accepted by the tribe as the woman \nhe wanted to be, was allowed to wear women\'s clothes, joined the \nwomen\'s craft guilds and dance societies. Eliade says, "Ritual and \nsymbolic transformation into a woman is probably explained by an \nideology derived from the archaic matriarchy." H \n\nAn observer in Maiaya said it was "more than likely that manang- \nism (shamanism) was originally a profession of women, and that men \nwere gradually admitted to it, at first only by becoming as much like \nwomen as possible." 15 The manang or shaman put on female \nclothing after initiation, and remained a transvestite for life. A Dyak \nmanang still wears women\'s dress and follows women\'s occupations. \n"This transvestism, with all the changes that it involved, is accepted \nafter a supernatural command has been thrice received in dreams: to \nrefuse would be to seek death. This combination of elements shows \nclear traces of a feminine magic and a matriarchal mythology, which \nmust formerly have dominated the shamanism of the Sea Dyak; almost \nall the spirits are invoked by the manang under the name of Ini \n(\'Great Mother\')." 16 \n\nThe Krishna cult as currently practiced in India still demands ritual \ntransvestism for men who adore the feminine principle by identifying \nthemselves with Krishna\'s Gopis. They wear the clothes and ornaments \nof women and even observe a "menstrual period" of a few days\' \n\n\n\n1015 \n\n\n\nTretuilngid retirement each month. According to their theological doctrine, "all \n\nTriangle souls are feminine to God." ,7 \n\n^^___^^^_^_ 1 Tacitus, 730. 2. Turville-Petre, 219. 3. Oxenstierna, 206. 4.

She also ruled springs and fountains. Money is still \noffered to the Roman fountain that bears her name, Trevi. \n\nThe modern meaning of "trivia" may be related to early attempts \nto belittle the cult of the Goddess and render unimportant the old \ncustom of offering gifts to her image for protection on journeys. \n\n\n\nTriangle \n\nTantric tradition said the triangle was the Primordial Image, or the \nfemale Triangle of Life. 1 It was known as the Kali Yantra, representing \nKali as Cunti, or else as the Yoni Yantra, or sign of the vulva. 2 In \nEgypt the triangle was a hieroglyphic sign for "woman," and it carried \nthe same meaning among the gypsies, who brought it from their \noriginal home in Hindustan. 3 In the Greek sacred alphabet, the delta or \ntriangle stood for the Holy Door, vulva of the All-Mother Demeter \n("Mother Delta"). \n\nMost ancient symbol systems recognized the triangle as a sign of \nthe Goddess\'s Virgin-Mother-Crone trinity and at the same time as \nher genital "holy place," source of all life. The triangle represented the \nVirgin Moon Goddess called Men-Nefer, archaic deity of the first \nMother-city of Memphis. 4 The triangle itself was worshipped in much \nthe same way that modern Christians worship the cross. Concerning \nthis, Oriental sages said: "The object of the worship of the Yantra is to \n\n\n\n1016 \n\n\n\nattain unity with the Mother of the Universe in Her forms as Mind, \nLife, and Matter . . . preparatory to Yoga union with Her as She is in \nherself as Pure Consciousness." 5 \n\nThe triangle was everywhere connected with the female trinity, \nand a frequent component of monograms of Goddesses.

In India, the "trident-bearer" was Shiva, bridegroom of \nthreefold Kali. 1 In the west, the trident passed to such underground or \nabyssal gods as Hades, Pluto, Neptune, and Poseidon, and after them \nto the Christian devil, their composite descendant. \n\nCeltic myth retained the original phallic significance of the Triple \nKey to the Holy Door. Like Shiva, the primitive Irish shamrock-god \nTrefuilngid Tre-Eochair was a "bearer of the triple key." Symbol of \nhis Door was the trefoil that the Arabs called shamrakh and the \nHindus worshipped as an emblem of Kali thousands of years before the \nfirst Aryans came to Ireland. 2 The Irish god was quaintly assimilated \nto Christianity by a Middle Irish text claiming that he appeared to \nFintan, king of Tara, on the day of Christ\'s death, bearing a sacred \nbranch with three fruits, and stone tablets of Celtic property law. 5 \n\nBecause the trident was generally recognized as a phallus in pagan \ntradition, Renaissance "devils" were often pictured with three- \npronged or forked penises. A devil "cum membro bifurcate" was \nmentioned in 1 520, and a number of inquisitorial judges said witches \ncopulated with devils whose phalli had two or more points. 4 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty, 130. 2.

Triduana was the Three Dianas, a threefold Lady of the \nMoon. She was credited with the same legend of eye-sacrifice as St. \nLucy, the Christian transformation of Juno Lucina (see Lucy, Saint). \nTriduana\'s shrine at Restalrig was destroyed in 1 560 by a church \narder that declared it "a monument of idolatry." \' So, even as a saint, \njhe proved to be unacceptable to the church that canonized her. \nl.Gifford, 131. \n\n\n\n1017 \n\n\n\nTrinity \n\n\n\nLike three-headed \nKali in India, Egypt\'s \nprimal mother Mut \nhad three heads and \nthree names. An ar- \nchaic name for Egypt, \nKhem, with a femi- \nnine ending formed the \nword for "three" \nKhemt* \n\n\n\nTrinity \n\nFrom the earliest ages, the concept of the Great Goddess was a trinity \nand the model for all subsequent trinities, female, male, or mixed. \nAnatolian villages in the 7th millenium b.c. worshipped a Goddess in \nthree aspects as a young woman, a birth-giving matron, and an old \nwoman. 1 This typical Virgin-Mother-Crone combination was Par- \nvati-Durga-Uma (Kali) in India, Ana-Babd-Macha (the Morrigan) in \nIreland, or in Greece Hebe-Hera-Hecate, the three Moerae, the \nthree Gorgons, the three Graeae, the three Horae, etc. Among the \nVikings, the threefold Goddess appeared as the Norns; among the \nRomans, as the Fates or Fortunae; among the druids, as Diana \nTriformis. The Triple Goddess had more than three: she had \nhundreds of forms. \n\nPre-Roman Latium worshipped her as the Capitoline Triad under \nthe collective name of Uni, "The One," a cognate olyoni. Her three \npersonae were Juventas the Virgin, Juno the Mother, and Menarva or \nMinerva the wise Crone. Under the empire, Juventas was ousted to \nmake room for a masculine member of the trinity, Jupiter. 2 Some \nmodern scholars refer to the two-female, one-male Capitoline Triad \nof the later period as "three gods" as if they might describe a group of \ntwo women and one man as "three men." 3 \n\nCumont says, "Oriental theologians developed the idea that the \nworld forms a trinity; it is three in one and one in three." 5 The \nmasculine scholar substitutes the neuter "world" for "Goddess," though \nthey were in a sense synonymous. It was she who established the \ntrinitarian form of Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer. Even though \nBrahmans evolved a male trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva to \nplay these parts, Tantric scriptures insisted that the Triple Goddess had \ncreated these three gods in the first place. 6 \n\nThe three aspects of the Goddess were personified on earth by \nthree kinds of priestesses: Yogini, Matri, Dakini nubile virgins, \nmothers, and elder women. These were sometimes called "deities of \nnature." Manifestations of the Triple Goddess were known as The \nThree Most Precious Ones. 7 \n\nNegritos of the Malay Peninsula remembered the Goddess as Kari, \na virgin who conceived the first man and woman by eating her own \nlotus; yet she was also a trinity called the "three grandmothers under the \nearth." 8 \n\nEven in pre-Columbian Mexico the Virgin Goddess who gave \nbirth to the Savior Quetzalcoatl was a trinity, one of "three divine \nsisters." Like the Semitic Mary, she was a birth-giver, mother, and \ndeath-bringer all at once, for she was also known as the Precious \nStone of Sacrifice, apparently represented by the altar on which her \nsavior-son\'s blood was poured out. 9 \n\nMother of the Greek gods was a trinity composed of Virgin Hebe, \nMother Hera, and Crone Hecate; at Stymphalus she was wor- \nshipped as Child, Bride, and Widow. 10 Each of her personae could be a \n\n\n\n1018 \n\n\n\ntrinity again, so she could be the Muses or the Ninefold Goddess. Trinity \n\nHecate was called Triformis and shown with three faces, each a lunar \n\nphase. 11 Among the Irish she was the Triple Morrigan, or Morgan, ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsometimes multiplied into "nine sisters" who kept the Cauldron of \n\nRegeneration and ruled the western isle of the dead. 12 \n\nThe Goddess Triformis ruled heaven as Virgin, earth as Mother, \nand the underworld as Crone, or Hel, or Queen of the Shades. This \nwas remembered even in Chaucer\'s time, for his Palamon invoked her \n"Three Forms," Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, Proserpine in \nhell. 13 The old name of Sicily, Trinacria, invoked her as a "center of the \nearth" with three realms. \n\nBardic romances abounded in manifestations of the Triple God- \ndess. Wayland the Smith married her, after she first appeared to him \nas three magic doves. 14 King Arthur went to Avalon with her. The \ntriadic Guinevere was another version of her. Sir Marhaus (Mars) \nencountered her as the Three Damosels at their magic fountain: the \neldest "threescore winters of age, wearing a garland of gold; the \nsecond thirty winters of age, wearing a circlet of gold; the youngest \nfifteen winters of age, wearing a wreath of flowers." 15 Fifteen was the \nnumber of the pagan Virgin Kore, the pentacle in the apple. Mythic \nvirgin mothers, like that of Zoroaster, typically gave birth at the age of \n1 5. Double that was the Mother\'s age, double again the age of the \nCrone. \n\nThe Middle East had many trinities, most originally female. As \ntime went on, one or two members of the triad turned male. The \nusual pattern was Father-Mother-Son, the Son figure envisioned as a \nSavior. 16 \n\nThe notion of a trinity appeared during the 14th century B.C. \namong the Hatti and Mitanni. In the 5th century B.C., a popular \nBabylonian trinity was composed of Shamash, Sin, and Ishtar Sun, \nMoon, and Star. In Greece this was repeated as Helios the sun, \nSelene the moon, and Aphrodite the star. A Father-Mother-Son trinity \nwas worshipped at Costopitum as Jupiter Dolichenus, Celestial \nBrigantia, and Sal us. 17 \n\nGnostic versions of the trinity followed the Father-Mother-Son \npatterns of the contemporary east, with the Holy Ghost recognized as \na female Sophia, the Dove, worshipped as the Great Goddess in \nConstantinople, and viewed by most Gnostics as the Shakti of God. \nThe Christian God was originally modeled on Far-Eastern heaven- \nfathers, such as Brahma and Dyaus Pitar, all of whom needed their \nfemale sources of "Power," or else they could not act. 18 Therefore, a \nfemale member of the triad was essential even to God. Among \nArabian Christians there was apparently a holy trinity of God, Mary, \nand Jesus, worshipped as an interchangeable replacement for the \nEgyptian trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. 19 \n\nDuring the Christian era, all-male trinities became popular among \nGermanic tribes. Woden, Thor, and Saxnot were worshipped together \n\n\n\n1019 \n\n\n\nTriptotemus by Saxons of the 8th and 9th centuries. Norsemen called them Odin, \n\nTristan Tyr, and Frey. According to a certain fragmentary myth, the Triple \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ Goddess seems to have been burned as a witch. She had to be burned \n\nto ashes three times. Afterward, youth, beauty, and love in the person of \nFreya departed from Asgard; and there was war in heaven. 20 \n\nLike many other remnants of paganism, the female trinity is still \nassociated with marriage. Breton wedding ceremonies celebrated the \nthree phases of the bride\'s life, impersonating her first by a little girl, \nthen by the mistress of a house, then by an old grandmother. 21 \nModern weddings still retain the flower girl and the matron of honor, \nbut significantly the Crone figure has vanished. \n\nAugust Comte nearly revived the female trinity in his vision of \nwoman as mediator between man and the guiding moral spirit. \nMother, wife, and daughter were to represent man\'s unity with past, \npresent, and future; also with what Comte called the three altruistic \ninstincts: veneration, attachment, benevolence. 22 In plainer words, these \nwere what women want from men: respect, love, kindness. \n\n1.

When he met his Shakti \nin the form of Iseult, he reversed the syllables of his name and \nintroduced himself as Tantris, which may have been a secret bardic pun \nor "recognition sign." \' Though Iseult was the wife of King Mark of \nCornwall, the poets called King Mark a "felon" for trying to prevent her \nfrom choosing her own lover. As a faithful votary of the Goddess of \nLove, Tristan was said to have been reincarnated in another of her \nvotaries, Thomas Rhymer. \n\nl.Guerber,L.M.A.,238. \n\n\n\n1020 \n\n\n\nTritone Tritone \n\nAthenians claimed their Goddess Athene was born from Zeus\'s head, \n\nbut her real origin was North African, in "an epoch when fatherhood ^^"^^^^^^^" \n\nwas not recognized."

Association with bridges suggests the Valkyries who guarded \nBifrdst, the Bridge of Heaven; they too were "trulls" or "trolls."

The custom was still common in the \n4th century a.d. See Firstborn. \n\n1.

The \nevent is shown on a famous silver plaque from Luristan, dated in the \n8th century b.c. 4 \n\nAmerican Indians said the White Manitu or Lord of Life and the \nBlack Manitu or Lord of Death were twins, born simultaneously from \nthe womb of the Moon-goddess, called The Old Woman Who Never \nDies, the real ruler of all gods and men. 5 \n\nGnostics said the sun god Sol, Helios, or Apollo had a dark twin, \nknown as Sol Niger (Black Sun), king of the nether world. The \nChaldeans called him Aciel. 6 The light god was transformed into the \ndark god when he entered into conjunction with their common mother, \nthe Moon. \n\nThroughout all mythologies the same pair can be found: twins of \n\n\n\n1022 \n\n\n\nlight and darkness, born from the Great Mother. Every dualistic Tyche \n\nreligion-such as Zoroastrianism-opposing a principle of evil to a princi- Typhon \n\npie of good had to begin with the two principles personified as offspring ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nof the primordial womb.

To be admitted to the Holy of Holies, a woman had to \nhave borne children to prove she had the spirit of fertility and the \n"wisdom of motherhood." \n\n\n\nUncle \n\nBefore recognition of physical fatherhood, and even for a long time \nafter it, most people viewed a mother\'s brother as a child\'s nearest male \nrelative, because he was united with the mother and the mother\'s \nmother by the all-important matrilineal blood bond. Hawaiians still use \n\n\n\n1026 \n\n\n\nthe same word for "father" and "uncle" because formerly they made Uni \n\nno distinction between them. 1 Unicorn \n\nTacitus said Germanic barbarians regarded the relationship be- ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ntween sister\'s sons and maternal uncles as "more sacred and binding" \nthan the relationship between sons and fathers. 2 The same was true of \nthe Celts. Early Christian missionaries in Ireland had to call Christ \n"our sister\'s son," because that was the only masculine relationship held \nsacred by the people. J \n\nMalory said the whole purpose of introducing Christianity into \nBritain was to establish laws of patrilineal succession and the authority \nof father. Among the pagans, fathers and sons cared nothing for one \nanother. 4 Only nephews and maternal uncles had a true blood bond. \nMore recently among the Semang, enlightened sages and prophets \nwere known as nephews of God, not sons of God. 5 \n\nFathers were of no significance in family relationships among the \nmatrilineal clans of early Latium. Inheriting this tradition, even \npatriarchal Romans distinguished between a father\'s brother, patruus, \nand a mother\'s brother, avunculus derived from avus, "ancestor." \nThe patruus was unimportant and usually ignored. 6 The avunculus was \nthe true uncle, as shown by the very word "uncle" which descended \nfrom his title, and "avuncular" which implies a benevolent interest. \nEurope still retains a linguistic memory of the dual-uncle system. A \nfather\'s brother is just an uncle; but a mother\'s brother is called "own \nuncle." \n\nSystems of uncle relationships were always older than those of \npaternity, having descended from the matriarchal period when father- \nhood was not understood.

Unial \n\nEtruscan name for the Great Mother\'s holy trinity, a "three-in-one" \nGoddess who gave birth to the uni-verse. She was represented by the \nsign of female genitals; Uni was a cognate of "yoni." In Rome, the \nthree were worshipped as the early Capitoline Triad of Virgin-Mother- \nCrone (Juventas, Juno, Minerva); but in Imperial times the virgin \nGoddess was removed to make room for Jupiter. 1 The name of Uni \nevolved into Iune, or Juno. \n\n1.

According to medieval legend, the unicorn could be \ncaptured only by a virgin girl, because his irresistible desire was to lay \n\n\n\n1027 \n\n\n\nUrania \nUraceus \n\n\n\nhis "horn" in a maiden\'s lap. While thus engaged, he was incapable of \nresisting capture. (However, no unicorns were ever captured.) \n\nThe unicorn was a secret phallic consort of the virgin Mary, shown \ninside her "enclosed garden" of virginity, in many examples of \nChristian mystical art. At times he was identified with the Savior. A \nmedieval hymn called Christ "the wild wild unicorn whom the \nVirgin caught and tamed." \' \n\nA source of the unicorn myth may have been the Babylonian \ndragon-beast made up of a horselike body with lion\'s forelegs, scales, \na snakelike neck and a flat horned head with a single spike growing from \nthe center of the nose. 2 One theory proposes that the unicorn was \noriginally the bull of spring, rearing up and struggling with the lion of \nsummer. Babylonian art showed both animals in profile, so the bull \nappeared to have only one horn. The British coat of arms still has "the \nlion and the unicorn" contending in just such a manner. 3 \n\nExplorers thought they found the legendary unicorn in the African \nrhinoceros. Because of the unicorn\'s phallic significance, powdered \nrhinoceros horn became a highly popular "remedy" for impotence, and \nis so used even today. 4 \n\n1. Harding, 51. 2. Hooke, S.P., 135. 3.

The serpent-mother was one of Egypt\'s oldest divinities, \nand her uraeus-snake idol signified healing. Moses copied this Egyptian \nmagic with his "brazen serpent" (Numbers 21:9). Egyptian rulers \nwore the uraeus-snake in the form of a rearing cobra on the forehead, \nrepresenting the "third eye" of mystical insight. Despite patriarchal \nopposition to the symbol of the she-serpent Uraeus, among later \nGnostic Christians her name became one of the "secret names of \nGod." See Serpent. \n\n\n\nUrania \n\n"Celestial One," title of Aphrodite as Queen of Heaven. Her former \nconsort Uranus was transformed into her castrated "father" in classical \nmyth; Uranus\'s patricidal son threw his severed genitals into the sea, \nand the sea-womb brought forth Aphrodite. Actually, Celestial Aphrodi- \nte and the sea-womb were one and the same: manifestations of the \nTriple Goddess. The castrated dying god was her ubiquitous son-lover \nwho died, fertilized her by his death, and begot himself again. \n\nUranus was a western form of Varuna, a deity of indeterminate \nsex, sometimes a male-turned-female like Hermes or Teiresias. To \n\n\n\n1028 \n\n\n\nthe Persians he was varan, a spirit of sexual intercourse like the Hindu Urd \n\nKama. His name came from vr, to envelop a female function and Urine \n\nhe performed female-imitative miracles, such as turning water into ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nblood, giving birth to the sun, and measuring the earth. 1 From the \nAsian precedents it may be assumed that Urania and Uranus were the \nsame primal androgyne as Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, etc. \n\n1.

Urth \n\nOne of the Norse names of Mother Earth, in addition to Urtha, \nErda, Eartha, Wyrd, Wurd, Word, Weird, etc. Urd was usually called \nthe divine fount of wisdom tended by the three Norns (Fates) under \nthe root of the World Tree; it was also the name of the oldest Norn, an \nEarth Goddess who knew everything, past, present, and future. The \ngods couldn\'t render judgment unless they gathered at the fount of Urd, \nbecause they were helpless without the wisdom imparted by the \nUrdarbrunnr, "Stream of Urd," which gave life and mind. Old mythol- \nogies held that the fount of wisdom was female, and without it \nneither men nor gods could know anything. 1 Another name for the \nfountain was Mimir, which means "Mother," although the same \nname was given later to Odin\'s maternal uncle, who brought him back \nto life with fluid from the Mother-spring and taught him the wisdom \nof the runes. \n\n1 .

Levitical law directed that these \narticles be carried in the high priest\'s "breastplate of judgment" \nwhenever he entered the tabernacle, so the mana of the holy place \nwould enter into them and yield correct prophecies (Exodus 28:30). \n\n\n\nline \n\nrom Uranus, "Father Heaven," whose magical urine, semen, or \nilood came down as rain to fertilize Mother Earth. Primitive myths \nresent all three fluids as the fertilizing principle. Zeus came down as \n\'golden rain" of urine to fertilize Danae, the Earth, whose priestesses \n\nle Danaids performed rain charms by carrying water in a sieve. \n\nccording to Aristophanes, rain was caused by Zeus urinating through a \n\n\n\n1029 \n\n\n\nUrsu| ^ Sjint s i eve . Aristotle mentioned the general belief that "Zeus does not rain \n\nin order to make the crops grow, but from necessity," suggesting that \n\n^^ Zeus rained for the same reason men urinated because he had to. 1 \n\n^" The Danaids founded the Eleusinian rite of Thesmophoria, when \n\nthe severed genitals of the sacred king were offered to the Goddess, \njust as the severed genitals of Uranus were given to the sea-womb. The \nreal genitals of a real victim were eventually replaced by symbolic \nsubstitutes: serpents and phallus-shaped loaves of bread. But the mean- \ning was the same a summoning of the god\'s urine, semen, or \nblood. 2 \n\nAeschylus said of the Danaids\' performance: "Rain falling from \nthe bridegroom sky makes pregnant the Earth. Then brings she forth \nfor mortals pasture of flocks and corn, Demeter\'s gift, and the fruitful- \nness of trees is brought to completion by the dew of their marriage." \nAs the Goddess was both Earth and Sea, the rain-urine-seed-blood, etc., \nfell on both. The priestesses looked up to the sky and cried, "Rain! " \nThen they looked down to the earth and cried, "Conceive! " ? \n\nRain-making was a chief function of Heavenly Fathers every- \nwhere. Rome\'s begetting god was Jupiter Pluvius, \nJupiter-Who-Makes-Rain, another version of Zeus, who was in turn a \nreplacement for Uranus. Even after the essential fluid was definitely \nidentified as semen, the other fluids were not forgotten. Urine remained \na popular rain charm. Shamans in Siberia used to bring rain by \n"making water" on the naked body of a woman who represented the \nearth. 4 In Iraq, when rain was wanted, a female dummy called the \nBride of God was placed in a field, in the hope that God would "make \nwater" on her. 5 \n\n1.

Ursel means "She-Bear," the title of Artemis \nCalliste, the same as the Helvetian Goddess Artio, in the guise of Ursa \nMajor, the Great Bear (Big Dipper), whose constellation circles the \npole star without disappearing into the sea. The ancients said Artemis \nthe She-Bear ruled all the stars until Zeus usurped her place. 1 \n\nThe mythical St. Ursula was accompanied by eleven thousand \nvirgins, a common pagan image of the Moon-goddess accompanied \nby her children, the stars. One of the Goddess\'s foremost shrines was \nCologne, where "Ursel" was converted into a Christian heroine to \naccount for the reverence paid to her by the local people. \n\nThe tale on which Ursula\'s canonization was based was first \ninvented about the 9th century a.d.; then, "During the 12th century \n\n\n\n1030 \n\n\n\nthis pious romance was preposterously elaborated through the mistakes Ursula, Saint \n\nof imaginative visionaries; a public burial-ground uncovered at Co- \nlogne was taken to be the grave of the martyrs, false relics came into ^^^^^^^^^ mK ^ \ncirculation and forged epitaphs of non-existent persons were \nproduced." 2 \n\nThe churchmen claimed that St. Ursula was a Breton princess \nbetrothed to Conon, prince of England, in the 5th century a.d. Prior \nto her marriage, she took her eleven thousand virgins on a pilgrimage. \nWhile passing through Cologne, they were attacked and slaughtered \nby the Huns, at the instigation of two Roman generals who feared the \nChristian ladies\' exemplary piety would convert all the northern \nbarbarians to Christ. 3 \n\nThis fable was intended to Christianize the lunar bear-goddess \nworshipped at Cologne, the same who was Artio, the Helvetian \n"Mother of Animals," with another cult center at Berne ("She-Bear"), \nwhere her portrait still appears on the Bernese coat of arms. 4 Ursel \nand Artio were alternate names of the triple Artemis who took the \n"bear-king" Arthur to paradise. The Greeks said Artemis Calliste, \n"Fairest One," was associated with both the moon and the constellation \nof the Great Bear. In Britain, Ursa Major was often called "Mistress \nUrsula," at first a title ofthe Goddess, later transferred to the saint. 5 \n\nArtemis the She-Bear was so widely recognized as the Mother \nof Animals that the island once sacred to her, Callista, is still called \nThera, "She-Beast." 6 Arcadians traced their descent from her son \nAreas, the Little Bear (Ursa Minor), a bear-god like the Celtic Arthur. \nHellenic mythographers pretended that Arcas\'s mother was a mere \nnymph, Calliste, who was punished for losing her virginity by receiving \nthe form of a bear, along with her child; but Artemis took pity on \nthem and placed them in the stars as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. This \nversion ofthe myth was invented "to account for the traditional \nconnection between Artemis and the Great Bear." 7 The Christian \nversion was invented for different reasons, but with the same ultimate \naim: to mortalize the Goddess. \n\nSome memory of Ursula the Moon-goddess seems to haunt the \nfoundation ofthe Ursuline order of nuns, by St. Angela Merici in \n1506. Catholic authorities now claim the Ursulines were the oldest \norder of teaching nuns. But most convents were centers of learning \nfor women until the church forbade women\'s education in the 1 3th \ncentury. 8 The Ursulines were perhaps the only order of teaching \nnuns who remained obedient to the papacy, and so were permitted to \ncontinue. \n\nYet the Ursulines began under a cloud of suspicion. Angela Merici \nwas a native of Brescia, which Pope Calixtus III described as a hotbed \nof witches. 9 Angela\'s first group of sisters numbered exactly 28, the \nlunar number. They made their first devotion in a church dedicated \nto another mythical saint who was only another transformation ofthe \nGoddess, St. Afra or Aphra (Aphrodite). 10 Angela was not allowed to \n\n\n\n1031 \n\n\n\nU^jert establish her holy society of teachers until forty years had passed since \n\nher original vision, which she received not in a church but in an open \n\n^^ field under the moon. She and her women had no religious habit, no \n\nvows, no communal life. They went to their pupils\' homes to teach, \nlike itinerant governesses. \n\nThe church was not interested in Angela until she underwent \n"popular" canonization in her home territory. Two centuries later, \nthe church decided to take advantage of the popularity of her cult by \ndeclaring her Blessed. Finally in 1807 she was canonized by Pope \nPius VII. 11 But she is still almost as vague and dim as the Ursuline lunar \nShe-Bear that the people of Brescia once worshipped. A 20th- \ncentury Catholic scholar mentioned her with one of those curious slips \nof the pen so common among patriarchal writers; he said the \nUrsuline order was founded by "Bishop Angela of Brescia." n \n\n1.

The Ur-text was supposed to \nbe a magical grammar of the primordial tongue, whose words God \npronounced at creation in order to bring forth the things themselves; \nthat is, the words could create, just by being spoken. The idea was \nbased on eastern notions of the creative power of Sanskrit, the Mother- \nlanguage. 1 Another development of the idea was the Neoplatonic \nLogos or "Seminal Word," which was adopted as a Christian dogma. \n(See Logos.) \n\nPresumably the Ur-text emanated from Abraham\'s "Ur of the \nChaldees," famous as the home of magic and astrology. The medi- \neval theory was that all words and names exerted some influence over \ntheir objects, hence the efficacy of both magic spells and liturgies. But \nin all known languages, the power of the word was slightly displaced \nfrom the true essence of the thing, as the calendar was slightly \ndisplaced from the sidereal year. In the Ur-text, words were precisely \naligned with essences or "souls," so the words could control things \nand events absolutely. \n\nThe implications were the same as in the Hindu idea of the "holy \nlanguage" of Sanskrit. Knowledge of the Ur-text would give a man \nabsolute power over the universe; whatever he said would come true at \nonce. \n\nMany magicians identified the Ur-text with the equally wonderful \nBook ofThoth, named after the Egyptian god of magic and men- \ntioned in very old Egyptian folk tales as a written version of Thoth\'s \ntechnique for creating by the power of the Word. One story claimed \n\n\n\n1032 \n\n\n\nthe book was found by a sage named Satni-Khamois in a Memphite Ur-Text \n\ntomb. It contained only two formulae but they were great hekau \n\n(words of power) : ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe two formulae that are written there, if thou recitest the first of them, \nthou shalt charm the heaven, the earth, the world of the night, the \nmountains, the waters; thou shalt understand what all the birds of heaven \nand the reptiles say, as many as there are. Thou shalt behold the fish, \nfor a divine power will bring them to the surface of the water. If thou \nreadest the second formula, even when thou art in the tomb, thou shalt \nresume the form thou hadst on earth; thou shalt also behold the sun rising \nin the heavens, and his cycle of gods, also the moon in the form that \nshe has when she appears. 2 \n\nThe first beneficiaries of this wondrous magic became immortal, \nnot by reading the book but by eating the papyrus it was written on al- \nthough the book continued to exist, hidden in underwater vessels \nguarded by the Great Serpent. 5 Eating instead of reading a piece of \nmagical literature was a common Oriental method of absorbing the \nvirtue of magic words even when one is unable to read. In Tibet, \nMadagascar, China, and Japan it was customary to cure diseases by \nwriting the curative charm on paper and eating the paper, or its ashes. 4 \nTartar lamas wrote the names of medicines on paper and made the \npatient swallow the prescription; for they believed "To swallow the \nname of a remedy, or the remedy itself . . . comes to precisely the \nsame thing." 5 \n\nThe same notion was often found in the west. The modern \npharmacist\'s Rx began as a curative symbol of Saturn, written on \npaper and eaten by the patient. 6 A common medieval prescription for \ntoothache was a paper bearing the magic words by which Jesus \nremoved a worm from St. Peter\'s tooth. 7 The Venerable Bede declared \nthat scrapings from the pages of "books that were brought out of \nIreland," when drunk in water, instantly cured snakebite. 8 \n\nWith so many different kinds of credulity in regard to the written \nwords especially among the majority to whom all writing was a \nmysterious, unknown magic it is hardly surprising that belief in the \nBook of Books, the Ur-text, survived. Some of the beliefs concerning \nthe Ur-text became attached to the Latin Bible, which the medieval \nchurch would not allow to be translated into any other language, \neven though the readings from the pulpit were quite incomprehensible \nto most congregations. The theory was that Latin was the language of \nSt. Peter\'s Roman see, and God intended the Bible to be written in that \nlanguage and no other; for the magic efficacy of the words lay in their \nsound, which would be lost if they were rendered in another tongue. \nThus, out of superstitious belief in the power of the Word, the \nchurch kept the "dead" language of Latin alive within its own in-group \nfor over 1 500 years. \n\n1.

Freud said, "Probably no male human being is \nspared the terrifying shock of threatened castration at the sight of the \nfemale genitals." l But he had the reason wrong. The real reason for \nthis "terrifying shock" is mouth-symbolism, now recognized universally \nin myth and fantasy: "It is well known in psychiatry that both males \nand females fantasize as a mouth the female\'s entranceway to the \nvagina." 2 \n\nThe more patriarchal the society, the more fear seems to be \naroused by the fantasy. Men of Malekula, having overthrown their \nmatriarchate, were haunted by a yonic spirit called "that which draws us \nto It so that It may devour us." 3 The Yanomamo said one of the first \nbeings on earth was a woman whose vagina became a toothed mouth \nand bit off her consort\'s penis. Chinese patriarchs said women\'s \ngenitals were not only gateways to immortality but also "executioners of \nmen." 4 Moslem aphorisms said: "Three things are insatiable: the \n\n\n\n1034 \n\n\n\ndesert, the grave, and a woman\'s vulva." 5 Polynesians said the savior- Vagina Dentata \n\ngod Maui tried to find eternal life by crawling into the mouth (or \n\nvagina) of his mother Hina, in effect trying to return to the womb of the ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nCreatress; but she bit him in two and killed him. 6 \n\nStories of the devouring Mother are ubiquitous in myths, repre- \nsenting the death-fear which the male psyche often transformed into \na sex-fear. Ancient writings describe the male sexuarfunction not as \n"taking" or "possessing" the female, but rather "being taken," or \n"putting forth." 7 Ejaculation was viewed as a loss of a man\'s vital force, \nwhich was "eaten" by a woman. The Greek sema or "semen" meant \nboth "seed" and "food." Sexual "consummation" was the same as \n"consuming" (the male). Many savages still have the same imagery. \nThe Yanomamo word for pregnant also means satiated or full-fed; and \n"to eat" is the same as "to copulate." 8 \n\nDistinction between mouths and female genitals was blurred by \nthe Greek idea of the lamiae lustful she-demons, born of the \nLibyan snake-goddess Lamia. Their name meant either "lecherous \nvaginas" or "gluttonous gullets." 9 Lamia was a Greek name for the \ndivine female serpent called Kundalini in India, Uraeus or Per-Uatchet \nin Egypt, and Lamashtu in Babylon. Her Babylonian consort was \nPazuzu, he of the serpent penis. Lamia\'s legend, with its notion that \nmales are born to be eaten, led to Pliny\'s report on the sexual life of \nsnakes that was widely believed throughout Europe even up to the 20th \ncentury: a male snake fertilizes the female snake by putting his head \ninto her mouth and allowing himself to be eaten. 10 \n\nSioux Indians told a tale similar to that of the Lamia. A beautiful \nseductive woman accepted the love of a young warrior and united \nwith him inside a cloud. When the cloud lifted, the woman stood alone. \nThe man was a heap of bones being gnawed by snakes at her feet. 11 \n\nMouth and vulva were equated in many Egyptian myths. Ma-Nu, \nthe western gate whereby the sun god daily re-entered his Mother, \nwas sometimes a "cleft" (yoni), and sometimes a "mouth." 12 Priestesses \nof Bast, representing the Goddess, drew up their skirts to display their \ngenitals during religious processions. 13 To the Greeks, such a display \nwas frightening. Bellerophon fled in terror from Lycian women \nadvancing on him with genitals exposed, and even the sea god Poseidon \nretreated, for fear they might swallow him. 14 \n\nAccording to Philostratus, magical women "by arousing sexual \nlesire seek to devour whom they wish." 15 To the patriarchal Persians \nind Moslems this seemed a distinct possibility. Viewing women\'s \nnouths as either obscene, dangerous, or overly seductive, they \nnsisted on veiling them. Yet men\'s mouths, which look no different, \nvere not viewed as threatening. \n\n"Mouth" comes from the same root as "mother" Anglo-Saxon \nnuth, also related to the Egyptian Goddess Mut. Vulvas have labiae, \nlips," and many men have believed that behind the lips lie teeth. \nChristian authorities of the Middle Ages taught that certain witches, \n\n\n\n1035 \n\n\n\nVagina Dentata with the help of the moon and magic spells, could grow fangs in their \n\nvaginas. They likened women\'s genitals to the "yawning" mouth of \n__ hell, though this was hardly original; the underworld gate had always \nbeen the yoni of Mother Hel. It had always "yawned" from Middle \nEnglish yonen, another derivative of "yoni." A German vulgarity \nmeaning "cunt," Fotze, in parts of Bavaria meant simply "mouth." 16 \n\nTo Christian ascetics, Hell-mouth and the vagina drew upon the \nsame ancient symbolism. Both were equated with the womb-symbol \nof the whale that swallowed Jonah; according to this "prophecy" the \nHell-mouth swallowed Christ (as Hina swallowed her son Maui) and \nkept him for three days. Visionary trips to hell often read like "a \ndescription of the experience of being born, but in reverse, as if the \nchild was being drawn into the womb and destroyed there, instead of \nbeing formed and given life." St. Teresa of Avila said her vision of a \nvisit to hell was "an oppression, a suffocation, and an affliction so \nagonizing, and accompanied by such a hopeless and distressing \nmisery that no words I could find would adequately describe it. To say \nthat it was as if my soul were being continuously torn from my body \nis as nothing." 17 \n\nThe archetypal image of "devouring" female genitals seems unde- \nniably alive even in the modern world. "Males in our culture are so \nafraid of direct contact with female genitalia, and are even afraid of \nreferring to these genitalia themselves; they largely displace their \nfeelings to the accessory sex organs the hips, legs, breasts, buttocks, et \ncetera and they give these accessory organs an exaggerated interest \nand desirability." 18 Even here, the male scholar inexplicably "displaces\' \nthe words sex organ onto structures that have nothing to do with \nsexual functioning. \n\nLooking into, touching, entering the female orifice seems fraught \nwith hidden fears, signified by the confusion of sex with death in \noverwhelming numbers of male minds and myths. Psychiatrists say sex \nis perceived by the male unconscious as dying: "Every orgasm is a \nlittle death: the death of \'the little man,\' the penis." 19 Here indeed is the \nroot of ascetic religions that equated the denial of death with denial of \nsex. \n\nMoslems attributed all kinds of dread powers to a vulva. It could \n"bite off" a man\'s eye-beam, resulting in blindness for any man who \nlooked into its cavity. A sultan of Damascus was said to have lost his \nsight in his manner. Christian legend claimed he went to Sardinia to \nbe cured of his blindness by a miraculous idol of the virgin Mary who, \nbeing eternally virgin, had her door-mouth permanently closed by a \nveil-hymen. 20 \n\nApparently Freud was wrong in assuming that men\'s fear of \nfemale genitals was based on the idea that the female had been \ncastrated. The fear was much less empathetic, and more personal: a fear \nof being devoured, of experiencing the birth trauma in reverse. A \nCatholic scholar\'s curious description of the Hell-mouth as a womb \n\n\n\n1036 \n\n\n\ninadvertently reveals this idea: "When we think of man entering hell Vajra \n\nwe think of him as establishing contact with the most intrinsic, unified, Valentine, Saint \n\nultimate and deepest level of the reality of the world." 21 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n1.

Young men chose partners for \nerotic games by drawing "billets" small papers with women\'s \nnames on them. Christians denounced these prototypical valentines as \n"heathens\' lewd customs." l Churchmen tried to substitute saints\' \nnames and short sermons on the billets, but people soon reverted to the \nold love-notes. 2 February was sacred to Juno Februata, Goddess of \nthe "fever" (febris) of love. The church replaced her with a mythical \nmartyr, St. Valentine, who was endowed with several contradictory \nbiographies. One of them made him a handsome Roman youth, \nexecuted at the very moment when his sweetheart received his billet \nof love. 3 \n\nSt. Valentine became a patron of lovers perforce, because the \nfestival remained dedicated to lovers despite all official efforts to \nchange it. Even in its Christianized form, the Valentinian festival \ninvolved secret sex worship, called "a rite of spiritual marriage with \n\n\n\n1037 \n\n\n\nVaMtyries \n\n\n\nangels in a nuptial chamber." 4 Ordinary human beings engaged before \nwitnesses in an act of sexual intercourse described as the marriage of \nSophia and the Redeemer. A spoken formula said, in part, "Let the see< \nof light descend into thy bridal chamber, receive the bridegroom . . . \nopen thine arms to embrace him. Behold, grace has descended upon \nthee." 5 \n\nDuring the Middle Ages, St. Valentine was much invoked in love \ncharms and potions, since he was a sketchily Christianized version of \nsuch love-gods as Eros, Cupid, Kama, Priapus, or Pan. \n\n1.

Previously, the Valkyries seem to have been Amazonian \npriestesses who ruled the gates of death, and in the most primitive times \neven cannibalized the dead to give them rebirth. \n\nValkyries were northern counterparts of the funerary vulture- \npriestesses of Egypt, often decking themselves in feathers. Like \nangelic Hindu apsaras, they wore swan feathers; or, in funerary aspect, \nthey appeared as carrion crows (ravens). Dead warriors were known \nin skaldic verse as hrafengrennir, "raven-feeders," and the blood of slain \nmen was called "the raven\'s drink." l In Old Saxon the Valkyries \nwere walcyries or waelceasig, "corpse-eaters," defined as "man-eating \nwomen" during the 1 1th century a.d. 2 \n\nValkyries in their black raven-feathers were called Kraken, or \n"crows." In the Middle East also, ravens were spirits of the lunar \nsphere of death and rebirth, symbolically preserved in Mithraic religion \nas the Raven who led the initiate into the first stage of mystical \nhierarchy, the sphere of the Moon. 3 Similar connotations were still \nattached to ravens in 1613 a.d., when Perkins\'s Witchcraft said if a \nraven stands on a high place (lunar sphere), "and looks a particular way \nand cries," death can be expected to come from that direction. 4 \n\nSwans, ravens, crows, or hawks represented Valkyries in old \nballads, such as "The Maiden Transformed into a Bird," who was \nfond of eating her true-love\'s flesh. This was beneficial to him, for after \nsacrificing his flesh to her, he attained a state of paradise in her arms. 5 \nEliade says, "The Valkyries are psychopomps and sometimes play the \nrole of the \'celestial wives\' or \'spirit wives\' of the Siberian shamans. . \n. . [T]his later complex extends beyond the sphere of shamanism and \nhas elements both of the mythology of Woman and the mythology of \nDeath." 6 \n\nThe Valkyries were also totemized as mare-women, like the \nancient horse-masked priestesses of Demeter. In Sweden, a mare- \nwoman was a volva, meaning Goddess, priestess, or a witch who could \n\n\n\n1038 \n\n\n\nturn into a mare and carry a man away to death. A cognate was vala, Vampire \n\na holy woman, with Slavic and central Asian counterparts in the Vilas, \n\nWilas, or Wilis, possibly derived from vilasa, the heavenly bliss ^ m \n\ndispensed by Hindu nymphs of paradise in the service of the Goddess. 7 \nSuch spirits were sometimes called Samovila or Samodiva: "death- \ngoddess." 8 Some claimed that death in the arms of a Vila was a blissful \npassage into a fairy paradise. Others said it was cruel torment. 9 \nNaturally, this was a mythic expression of various ways of dying. See \nVila. \n\nThe Grimnismal lists 13 Valkyries, the number of a witches\' \ncoven; other sources said there were only nine, the number of the \nMuses. From the 10th to the 14th centuries, Valkyries and witches \nwere considered identical; both were also mystic swan-maidens and \nfairies. 10 Earthly priestesses who played the Valkyrie role in pagan \nfunerals were described by churchmen as either Vilas or witches. 11 \n\nValhalla or Valholl was the death-realm of Hel, the Great Vala. \nThough it was taken over by new gods led by Father Odin, its archaic \nfeminine name remained. Later myths made it a paradise reserved \nsolely for warriors and war-kings, members of the military caste who \nshared the opinions of Japanese samurai and Moslem "soldiers of \nAllah," that heavenly bliss belonged only to those who died fighting \nbravely. \n\nRadbod, king of the Frisians, refused to abandon this faith when a \nChristian missionary informed him that Valhalla was the same as the \nChristians\' hell. Where were his own ancestors, Radbod wanted to \nknow, if there was no Valhalla? He was told they were burning in hell \nbecause they were heathens. "Dastardly priest!" Radbod cried.

Guerber, L.R.,9. \n\n\n\nVampire \n\nThe primal notion that all life depends on the magic of menstrual \nblood or "the blood of Moon," as some primitives say evolved a \ncorresponding notion that the dead crave blood in order to make \nthemselves live again. 1 Greeks believed the shades of the dead could be \nrecalled from the underworld by offerings of blood, which they \ngreatly desired; therefore blood was the essential ingredient of necro- \nmancy. Homer\'s Odysseus consulted the dead with a necromantic \nceremony: "I took the sheep and cut their throats over the trench, and \nthe dark blood flowed forth, and lo, the spirits of the dead that be \ndeparted gathered them from out of Erebus." 2 \n\n\n\n1039 \n\n\n\nVampire \n\n\n\nThe Greek word for \na vampire was sarco- \nmenos, "flesh made \nby the moon."\' The \nword "vampire" was \nSlavic, possibly trace- \nable to central Asia, \nthence to India. The Si- \namese still call a \nlunar sabbath day vam- \npra. As in early \nGreece, there were two \nvampra sabbaths in \neach lunar month, at \nthe new moon and \nfull moon, with lesser \nsabbaths on the quar- \nters to make four \nseven-day weeks.\' 1 \n\n\n\nEver since Homer\'s time, western nations had the fixed idea that \nblood could recall the dead to life, at least temporarily. Regular \nsupplies of blood would impart a kind of life to the "un-dead," that is, \nvampires. They were called forth by the moon, their original Mother, \nwho also called forth the blood that made the living. Since the moon \nwas the original home of the dead and the source of rebirth, it was \nclosely associated with vampires. Breton churchmen, still not altogether \ncertain of the physiology of conception in the Middle Ages, claimed \nthat a woman who exposed her naked body to moonlight would \nconceive and bear a vampire child. 5 Yet common folk continued to \nexpress in their customs the older belief that the souls of all children \nwaited in the moon to be reborn. Scottish girls refused to be married \nat any time except during the full moon, for fear they otherwise might \nnot have children. New brides in the Orkneys went to a circle of \nmegalithic stones locally called the Temple of the Moon to pray for \nbabies. 6 \n\nThe idea that the moon provided vital force for both the living and \nthe dead persisted through the centuries, and reappeared as emphati- \ncally as ever in popular vampire literature only a hundred years ago. \nBoucicault\'s The Vampire instructed his servants to carry his body to \na high mountain where it could be touched by the first rays of the rising \nmoon. When this was done, the vampire sprang back to life, saying, \n"Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy \nthee!" 7 An English friar once said, "The moon is the mother of all \nhumors," and the body\'s most important life-giving "humor" was \nblood. 8 \n\nTherefore, vampires walked wherever the moon shone and they \nmight find blood; the church taught this, and no laymen dared to \ndoubt it. Balkan countries had certain wizards who specialized in \nbottling vampires, a technique they probably learned from Arabian \nmagicians who put djinn (Latin genii) into bottles or lamps, like the \nlamp of Aladdin. When a Bulgarian village panicked over a purport- \ned outbreak of vampirism, the specialist was called. He would solemnly \nidentify the offender\'s grave, bait his bottle with blood, catch the \nrestless spirit, cork him up, and burn the bottle. 9 \n\nThe Rev. Montague Summers mentions a sure cure for vampir- \nism, which would have been simple, and eliminated all the dramatic, \ntime-consuming, ultimately ineffective classical measures such as exor- \ncisms, crucifixes, garlic, silver bullets, stakes through hearts, and so \non. This simple solution was to place a consecrated host in a vampire\'s \ngrave, which would immobilize him forever. However, Summers \nsaid, this remedy "was not to be essayed, since it savors of rashness and \nprofanation of God\'s Body." 10 Summers, an earnest believer, evi- \ndently thought it was better to let a community be ravaged by \nmarauding vampires than to profane Eucharistic bread. \n\nSummers also attacked the rational doubts of Dom Calmet, \nwho wrestled with the physical improbabilities of vampirism two \n\n\n\n1040 \n\n\n\ncenturies earlier, asking questions that no one ever bothered to answer: Vampire \n\nHow can a corpse which is covered with four or five feet of earth, which \n\nhas no room even to move or to stretch a limb, which is wrapped in mi^mmmmmmimmmmmm \n\nlinen cerements, enclosed in a coffin of wood, how can it, I say, seek the \n\nupper air and return to the world walking upon the earth so as to cause \n\nthose extraordinary effects which are attributed to it? And after all that \n\nhow can it go back again into the grave, when it will be found fresh, \n\nincorrupt, full of blood exactly like a living body? Can it be maintained \n\nthat these corpses pass through the earth without disturbing it, just as \n\nwater and the damps which penetrate the soil or which exhale therefrom \n\nwithout perceptibly dividing or cleaving the ground? It were indeed to \n\nbe wished that in the histories of the Return of Vampires which have been \n\nrelated, a certain amount of attention had been given to this point, and \n\nthat the difficulty had been something elucidated. " \n\nRev. Summers quickly disposed of Dom Calmet\'s questions in \nthe accepted theological manner, not by answering them but by \ndenouncing the asking of them: \n\nThese difficulties which Dom Calmet with little perception has raised . . . \nare not only superficial but also smack of heterodoxy. . . . [OJne can \nhardly brush aside the vast vampire tradition. . . . Can the Devil endow a \nbody with those qualities ofsubtilty, rarification, increase, and diminish- \ning, so that it may pass through doors and windows? I answer that there is \nno doubt the Demon can do this, and to deny the proposition is hardly \northodox. \' 2 \n\nFrom the church\'s "vast vampire tradition," Summers conclud- \ned: "There can be no doubt that the vampire does act under satanic \ninfluence and by satanic direction." 1? This assertion was made not in \nthe 12th or 13th century, but in the year 1928. \n\nA thinly disguised reason for the never-failing popularity of vam- \npire stories was, of course, their suggestion of sinful sex. Kissing and \nbiting ran close together in both mental and actual behavior; and the \nattack of a male or female vampire on a victim of the opposite sex \nsurely bore some resemblance to a love-bite. One of the all-time classics \nof vampire literature, Prest\'s Varneythe Vampire, titillated Victorian \nmale readers with scenes more suggestive of rape than of demonology: \n\nThat young and beautiful girl exposed to so much terror . . . . Her \nbeautiful rounded limbs quivered with the agony of her soul. The \nglassy horrible eyes of the figure ran over that angelic form with a hideous \nsatisfaction horrible profanation. He drags her head to the bed\'s edge. \nHe forces it back by the long hair still entwined in his grasp. With a plunge \nhe seizes her neck in his fanglike teeth. M \n\nThe church sanctioned vampire superstitions in order to draw \nconverts through fear, and church rituals officially established the \nburning or piercing of suspected vampires in their graves. Even in the \npresent century this was still done by priests in the Balkans. 15 Jean- \nJacques Rousseau showed the evidence for the existence of vampires \n\n\n\n1041 \n\n\n\nVsrir \nVaruna \n\n\n\nresting on much the same foundations as the evidence for the existence \nof God: "If there ever was in the world a warranted and proven \nhistory, it is that of vampires; nothing is lacking, official reports, \ntestimonials of persons of standing, of surgeons, of clergymen, of \njudges; the judicial evidence is all-embracing." ,6 \n\nThe most famous fictional vampire of them all, Count Dracula, \ndid have a real history. He was a feudal baron of sadistic tempera- \nment, Vlad the Impaler, of the Little Dragon clan: that is, Dracule. He \nliked to impale his enemies on stakes, while he cut, roasted, and ate \npieces of flesh from their still-living bodies. 17 The fear engendered by \nthis monster was such that his serfs believed he would return to \nplague them even after his death. Of course no such revenant has ever \nreappeared, but the Count\'s clan nickname, at least, seems truly \nimmortal. \n\n1. Chagnon, 38. 2. Homer, 163. 3. Summers., V, 19. 4. Briffault 2, 425. \n5.

The warlike Aesir led by Father \nOdin moved into the territory of the Vanir and made war against them, \nbeginning with an act of cruelty: the Aesir seized and tortured their \nholy sorceress, Gullveig. 1 In the end the Vanir were conquered, but \nmany generations remained in awe of their miraculous powers. They \nwere said to have accomplished everything by magic, and invented all \nthe knowledge that the new gods learned. 2 \n\nWhether the Vanir were described as elder gods, giants, elves, \nmatriarchs, or "primal ancestresses," they seem to have represented \npre-patriarchal farming cultures who were forced to give way to nomad- \nic Aryan invaders. \n\n1.

He was sometimes female, sometimes an androgyne \nrepresenting sexual union. In this guise, he-she probably became the \nPersian Varan, a "spirit of concupiscence." Varuna was paired with \nMitra, a similar entity, a sister or male twin; from this deity evolved the \nPersians\' wholly masculinized Mithra. \n\n1 . Lxroussc, 328. \n\n\n\n1042 \n\n\n\nVas Hermeticum, Vas Spirituale \n\nAlchemical terms for the symbolic Grail, signifying the womb of \nmatter, a universal vessel of all transformations. The original symbol was \nthe "Vase" of life and death representing the womb of the Great \nGoddess Rhea Pandora. Among Christian mystics, Vas Spirituale was a \ncommon title of the virgin Mary. \n\n\n\nVas Hermeticum \nVenus \n\n\n\nVenus \n\nRoman name for the Great Goddess in her sexual aspect, derived \nfrom the eponymous mother of Venetian tribes of the Adriatic, after \nwhom the city of Venice was also named. "Veneration" and "ven- \nery" were further derivatives. Venery used to mean hunting; for, like \nher eastern counterpart Artemis, Venus was once a Lady of Animals, \nand her Horned God Adonis, both the hunter and the sacrificial \nstag became venison, which meant "Venus\'s son." J \n\nEarly Christian fathers denounced the temples "dedicated to the \nfoul devil who goes by the name of Venus a school of wickedness \nfor all the votaries of unchasteness." 2 What this meant was that they \nwere schools of instruction in sexual techniques, under the tutelage of \nthe veneriiox harlot-priestesses. 3 They taught an approach to spiritual \ngrace, called venia, through sexual exercises like those of Tantrism. 4 \n\nLike Tantric yogis, educated Romans envisioned the moment of \ndeath as a culminating sexual union, a final act of the sacred marriage \npromised by the religion of Venus. Ovid, an initiate, said he wished to \ndie while making love: "Let me go in the act of coming to Venus; in \nmore senses than one let my last dying be done." 5 Centuries later, in \nShakespeare\'s time, "to die" was still a common metaphor for sexual \norgasm. 6 An English treatise on interpretation of dreams said if a sick \nman dreamed of marrying a lovely maiden, it meant death. 7 When \nChristians said to die was to be gathered to the bosom of Christ or \nAbraham, they unwittingly based the concept on the ancient female \none. \n\nModern interpretations of classical mythology tend to picture \nVenus as a sex goddess only. Her birth-giving and death-giving \naspects have been suppressed; but they were equally important in her \ncult. As Queen of the Shades she was identified with Proserpine, but \nwent by the name of Libitina. Plutarch said Libitina was only another \nname for Venus, "the goddess of generation." 8 \n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, Venus became the ruling Fairy \nQueen of the magic mountains called Venusbergs. She also became \na Christian saint, St. Venerina, who never existed in human form but \nonly as a cult figure continuing the worship of the Goddess in \nCalabria. 9 In the Balkans she was called St. Venere, and is still invoked \nas a patron of marriage by young girls making a wish that they might \nfind good husbands. 10 The magic rhyme addressed to the planet Venus \n\n\n\n? \n\n\n\nSign of Venus \n\n\n\n1043 \n\n\n\nVenus Observa | as Evening Star still echoes down the centuries: "Star light, star \n\nVeronica, Saint bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ I wish tonight." \n\n^^"^^^^^ Venus the Evening Star was also Stella Maris, Star of the Sea. In \n\nher sacred city of Venice, on Ascension Day each year, the Duke of \nVenice ceremonially married her by throwing a gold wedding ring into \nthe sea. 11 This practice continued through Renaissance times, even \nwhen the title of Stella Maris was assimilated to Mary. \n\n1 Potter & Sargent, 209. 2.

Thus it came to be known as the "mission- \nary position," and native couples often made fun of it in secret. \n\n1. Graves & Patai, 67. \n\n\n\nVeronica, Saint \n\nSt. Veronica was not a person but only a contraction of two Latin \nwords, vera iconica, "the true image." In 8th-century Rome, a cloth \nimprinted with a man\'s face appeared in St. Peter\'s basilica and was \nadvertised as the vera iconica of Christ. The legend invented to accoun \nfor it was that, as Jesus was carrying his cross, a woman named \nVeronica wiped the sweat from his face with her veil, which miraculous \nly took the image of the divine face. 1 \n\nSuch stories were not uncommon in the ancient world. An old \nGreek tale told of Pandarus the Thessalian, who had "shameful \nletters" on his brow until the god Asclepius miraculously removed then \nto a scarf that Pandarus bound on his forehead. 2 Another pagan tale \nwas adapted to the Veronican legends: the king of Edessa sent an artist \nto paint Jesus\'s portrait; but the artist couldn\'t see Jesus\'s face because \nof its blinding sunlike brightness. So he merely pressed a cloth to the \ndivine features, and the imprint rendered a perfect portrait. Another \nimpossible story claimed that Veronica\'s veil cured the emperor Tiberi- \n\n\n\n1044 \n\n\n\nus of sickness, so he carried it to Rome on a road entirely spread with \nsilk and installed it in the shrine where it was "found" eight centuries \nlater. 5 \n\nSt. Veronica\'s act of veil-imprinting is still included in the Stations \nof the Cross, though some churchmen recommended its elimination \non the ground that the legend\'s transparent fakery is becoming too well \nknown. 4 \n\n1.

Verthandi \nsignified the present, while her sisters Urth and Skuld stood for the past \nand future. 1 As the Weird Sisters, or Mothers of Fate (wyrd), they \ncorresponded to the Greek Moerae, Latin Fortunae, and other versions \nof the Triple Goddess. Verthandi also governed motherhood and the \nphases of the moon, like Kali the Preserver. \n\nl.Branston,209. \n\n\n\nVesica Piscis \n\n"Vessel of the Fish," a common yonic symbol, the pointed oval, \nnamed from the ancients\' claim that female genitals smelled like fish. \nMother Kali herself appeared in a Hindu story as "a virgin named \nFishy Smell, whose real name was Truth," like Egypt\'s Goddess Maat. 1 \nEgyptians said Abtu, the Abyss, was "a fish who swallowed the penis \nof Osiris," but this abyss was also "The Fish of Isis," therefore a sexual \nmetaphor. Aphrodite\'s principal rites at Paphos took place under the \nsign of Pisces, the Fish. Aphrodite, Isis, Freya, and other forms of the \nGoddess in sexual aspect appeared veiled in fish nets. 2 See Fish. \n\nThe vesica piscis was an unequivocally genital sign of the sheila- \nna-gig figures of old Irish churches. The squatting naked Goddess \ndisplayed her vulva as a vesica, as did the temple-door images of Kali in \nIndia. 3 One of the old pagan ideograms of sexual union was adopted \nby the church to represent the Feast of St. Nicholas on the runic \ncalendar: a vesica piscis enveloping a male furka. 4 \n\nThe pointed-oval fish sign was even used by early Christians to \nrepresent the mystery of God\'s union with his mother-bride which \nis why Jesus was called "the little Fish" in the Virgin\'s fountain. 5 \n\nThis female enclosure was much used in Christian art, especially \nas a superimposition on Mary\'s belly, with her child within. Some- \ntimes Christ at his ascension was shown rising into a heavenly vesica, as \nif returning to the Mother-symbol. The vesica was also shown as a \nframe for figures of Jesus, God, and saints. \n\nAnother name for the same sign was mandorla, "almond," which \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVesica Piscis \n\n\n\n1045 \n\n\n\nVestal Virgins \n\n\n\nalso represented a yoni.

Descendants of an ancient order of holy \nwomen who guarded the public hearth and altar, the Vestals were \nentrusted with keeping alight the perpetual fire that was the mystic heart \nof the empire. \n\nVestals were vkgines, i.e., women who vowed never to marry \nbecause they were brides of the spirit of Rome, in the same sense that \nChristian nuns were brides of Christ. Vestals underwent the same \nceremony that was later applied to nuns, to limit their magic female \npowers: they had their hair shaved off. 1 In an earlier era, however, they \nwere not so restricted. Like all other ancient priestesses who ruled by \nvirtue of magic and motherhood, the Vestals used to be the governing \nsisterhood of Latium. \n\nRhea Silvia or "Rhea of the Woodland" was called the First \nVestal; she was actually the Goddess Rhea transplanted to the Latin \ncolonies. According to Roman legend, she gave birth to Romulus and \nRemus, the founders of Rome. Their midwife, Acca Larentia, \nanother Vestal described as a "courtesan," gave birth to all the ancestral \nspirits the Romans called lares. (See Akka.) \n\nThe Vestals were never altogether virginal in the physical sense. \nTheir marriage to the phallic deity of the Palladium was physically \nconsummated in Vesta\'s temple, under conditions of great secrecy. The \nceremony was performed by a priest called the Pontifex Maximus, \n"great maker of the pons," which meant a bridge, a path, or a way. The \nPontifex Maximus had what Dumezil calls "an obscure, now un- \nknown duty" toward the Vestal Virgins. 2 One might suppose that his \n"way" was something like the Way of eastern sex-sacraments; that is, \nhe built the "bridge" between Father Heaven and Mother Earth \n(Vesta). \n\nThe office of Pontifex was adopted by Christians, and became a \n"pontiff," synonymous with "pope." The Vestals however were \nemphatically not adopted by Christians, although several of the details \nof their habit and lifestyle passed on to Christian convents. Pagans \nrevered the Vestals and were horrified by the way they were treated by \nChristian regimes in the 4th and 5th centuries. In 382 a.d., the \nendowments of all the pagan temples were withdrawn, including that of \nVesta\'s 600-year-old Mother-hearth. "Worst of all in the opinion of \nsome traditionalists, the fire on Vesta\'s hearth was to be permitted to go \nout: the Vestal Virgins were to lose their endowments and immunity \nfrom taxation, and all their privileges were to be taken away. The tiny \n\n\n\n1046 \n\n\n\norder of six Vestals was particularly hated by the Christians. . . . Their Vida \n\nChristian enemies feared them as mysterious and magical: they did not Vila \n\nunderstand them and did not want to do so; they wanted only to see m^^^^^^^^^mmt \nthem destroyed." 3 \n\n1.

Will \n\nSlavic witch-spirit associated with water; cognate of the Scandinavian \nVala or Valkyrie. Russian Vilas were sometimes known as Rusalki, \ndaughters of Holy Mother Russia (Earth). Like Valkyries, the Vilas \nof old had charge of the rites of death and the guiding of souls. \n\nSometimes, especially favored men were invited to join the Vilas \nfor a while, usually seven years. A man would be invited into a cave \nor hollow tree, and find himself in fairyland. He was "one who has won \nthe love of a Vila," and his title was Krstnik, a "Christ," which meant \nboth an Anointed One and an Accursed One. 1 That is, he was the \nSlavic version of the Enchanted Hunter (Chasseur Maudit), or \nThomas Rhymer, Tannhauser, etc. \n\nIn Dalmatia, a man associated with the Vilas was called Macieh, \nMessiah." He took the form of a youth in a Phrygian cap, like the \nIndo-Iranian sun-hero Mithra. 2 The female spirits he lived with were \nalso called krstaca, "crossed ones," from krst, a cross cognate with \nboth the Greek Christos and the Saxon "curst." The female spirits were \nalso known as Rogulja, "Horned Ones." 3 \n\n\n\n1047 \n\n\n\nVirginal, Ice Queen \nVirgin Birth \n\n\n\nVilas or Wilis came to be feared as angry, dangerous "souls of \ndrowned women" who dwelt in water, perhaps because so many \n"witches" were drowned. Like Sirens, they were supposed to draw into \nthe waters any heedless wayfarer who happened to see them dance by \nmoonlight. They still dance on modern stages in the classical ballet \nGiselle; the old fear of them resides in such phrases as "it gives me \nthe willies." A cold shudder was said to be a prophetic touch from a \nWili\'s deathly hand. However, traces of the priestesses\' former \nbenevolence are found in the legend that where they danced on the \nnights of the old pagan festivals, there the grass grew thicker and the \nwheat flourished more abundantly. 4 \n\n1.

She lived in the high Himalayas, an< \nsometimes came down to form alliances with men; but always she \nreturned to her lonely glaciers. In European folk tales, Virginal the Ice \nQueen lived alone in the pure upper snowfields of the mountains, \nbut once she descended to a valley to become the bride of a minstrel- \nwizard, Dietrich von Bern. Soon, however, she wearied of the \nlowlands and of him, and went back to her inviolable mountaintop, \nwhere "she still rules supreme." \' \n\nThe Norse version of Durga- Virginal was the death-goddess \nSkadi, who married the god Njord but grew tired of living with him \nin the lowlands by the sea, so she returned alone to her mountains. \nSome say she became the evil Snow Queen who would kidnap \nchildren from their homes and take away their souls. \n\nSince snow-covered mountains were widely associated with the \nmilk-giving breasts of Mother Earth, it is possible that Durga the \nInaccessible and similar Ice Queens represented the nursing Goddess, \nin the period when lactating human females, like lactating animal \nfemales, were literally inaccessible to the male. Preoccupied with \nmotherhood, the Goddess became "virgin" again in her refusal to \ntolerate male attentions. She "withdrew" from her marriage and went \naway to a place where no man could follow. There was an archetypal \nelement in these stories. As M.-L. von Franz has said, "One may \nsuddenly find oneself up against something in a woman that is \nobstinate, cold, and completely inaccessible." 2 \n\nI. Guerber, L.M.A., 115. 2. Jung, MRS., 189. \n\n\n\nVirgin Birth \n\n"Holy Virgin" was the title of harlot-priestesses of Ishtar, Asherah, or \nAphrodite. The title didn\'t mean physical virginity; it meant simply \n\n\n\n1048 \n\n\n\n"unmarried." The function of such "holy virgins" was to dispense \nthe Mother\'s grace through sexual worship; to heal; to prophesy; to \nperform sacred dances; to wail for the dead; and to become Brides of \nGod. \n\nChildren born of such temple women were called by the Semites \nbathur, by the Greeks parthenioi, "virgin-born." \' According to the \nProtoevangelium, the Virgin Mary was a kadesha and perhaps married \nto one of that class of priests known as "fathers of the god." 2 See \nFirstborn. \n\nMary\'s impregnation was similar to Persephone\'s. In her Virgin \nguise, Persephone sat in a holy cave and began to weave the great \ntapestry of the universe, when Zeus appeared as a phallic serpent, to \nbeget the savior Dionysus on her. 3 Mary sat in the temple and began \nto spin a blood-red thread, representing Life in the tapestry of fate, \nwhen the angel Gabriel "came in unto her" (Luke 1:28), the biblical \nphrase for sexual intercourse. Gabriel\'s name means literally "divine \nhusband." 4 \n\nHebrew Gospels designated Mary by the word almah, mistakenly \ntranslated "virgin," but really meaning "young woman." 5 It was \nderived from Persian Al-Mah, the unmated Moon-goddess. 6 Another \ncognate was Latin alma, "living soul of the world," virtually identical \nto Greek psyche, Sanskrit shakti. The Holy Virgins or temple-harlots \nwere "soul-teachers" or "soul-mothers" the alma mater. \n\nChristian translators insisted on rendering Mary\'s title as "virgin," \nwhich saddled their religion with an embarrassing article of faith. \nEven today, theologians like Karl Barth declare that "It is essential to the \ntrue Christian faith to accept the doctrine of the virgin birth" thus \ndrastically reducing the number of people who can be called true \nChristians. 7 \n\nEarly Christians demanded a virgin birth for their Savior out of \nsimple imitativeness. All the other Saviors had one, for they were \nborn of the Goddess incarnate in a chosen "virgin of the temple," \nwhose business it was to bear Saviors. The notion that mortal women \nwere impregnated by gods or spirits was a matter of everyday acceptance \nthroughout the ancient world. Even the Old Testament says the \narchaic "giants" (ancestral heroes) were born of mortal women impreg- \nnated by spirits that came from God (Genesis 6:4). \n\nZoroaster, Sargon, Perseus, Jason, Miletus, Minos, Asclepius, and \ndozens of others were God-begotten and virgin-born. Even Zeus, the \nHeavenly Father who begot many other "virgin-born" heroes, was \nhimself called Zeus Mamas, "Virgin-born Zeus." 8 Plutarch noted \namong the Egyptians the common belief that the spirit of God was \ncapable of sexual intercourse with mortal women. 9 \n\nHeracles was born of another almah, the Virgin Alcmene, whose \nname means Power of the Moon. 10 Her husband also, like the \nbiblical Joseph, kept away from her bed during her pregnancy. The \nsame tale was told of Plato, whose nephew affirmed that he was \n\n\n\nVirgin Birth \n\n\n\nThe temple hiero- \ndules were called \nvirgines or venerii in \nRome, horae in Greece, \nkadishtu, qadesh, or \nkadesha in Babylon, Ca- \nnaan, and Palestine. \n\n\n\n1049 \n\n\n\nVirgin Birth \n\n\n\nSt. Justin Martyr \n\nChristian apologist of \nthe 2nd century, \nborn of pagan parents \nand trained in philos- \nophy before his \nconversion. In addi- \ntion to his Apologia and \nDinlogus, many \nanonymous later works \nwere falsely attribut- \ned to his pen. \n\n\n\nbegotten by the god Apollo, his earthly parents having no sexual \nrelations until after his birth. 11 Christians believed this, and solemnly \nattested that Plato was a virgin-born son of the sun god. 12 \n\nAfter Christianity was established as the official religion of the \nRoman empire, however, church fathers tried to discredit all other \nvirgin births by claiming that the devil had devised them, and malicious- \nly placed them in a past time, so they would pre-date the real Savior. \nJustin Martyr wrote, "When I am told that Perseus was born of a virgin \nI realize that here again is a case in which the serpent and deceiver \nhas imitated our religion." 1? \n\nDespite the efforts of church fathers, the virgin birth of Jesus was \nneither the first nor the last such miracle given credence by Chris- \ntians. Priapic idols of antiquity, credited with the power to father \nchildren, actually fathered other priapic idols who became saints like \nFoutin, Gurtlichon, Gilles, Regnaud, and Guignole; these were credit- \ned with the same power of fertilization and were much adored by \nwomen who desired offspring. 14 Women of Tuscany and Portugal \nthought they could become pregnant by eating apples specially \nconsecrated by a priest. Spaniards remembered the virgin birth of Mars, \nand thought any woman could conceive like Mars\'s mother Juno, by \neating a lily. It was believed that souls could enter a woman\'s body in \nthe form of flies, worms, or serpents, to cause impregnation. Cases \nwere solemnly documented, like that of a Scot named Gillie Downak \nChravolick, conceived when his mother raised her skirts on an old \nbattlefield and received into her "private member" some ashes from the \nburned bones of dead warriors. 15 As impregnation by a god used to be \nthe "acceptable explanation for pregnancy in most pagan countries \nwhere the sexual act was part of the fertility rites," so Christians \nthought impregnation by spirits was still credible, whether the alleged \nfather was a dead hero, a devil, an incubus, or even in some sects \nthe Holy Ghost again. 16 \n\nSuch an untenable belief survived because it was important to \nmen. The impossible virgin mother was everyman\'s longed-for reso- \nlution of Oedipal conflicts: pure maternity, never distracted from her \ndevotion by sexual desires. Churchmen unwittingly showed their \nanxiety by denying even the evidence of their own Gospels that Jesus \nhad brothers and sisters. St. Ambrose insisted that Mary never \nconceived again, since God couldn\'t have chosen for his mother-bride \n"a woman who would defile the heavenly chamber with the seed of a \n\n\'17 \n\n\n\nman. \n\n\n\nTheologians in effect severed the two halves of the pagan God- \ndess, whose realistic femininity combined abundant sexuality and \nmaternity. One half was labeled harlot and temptress, the other a female \nascetic even in motherhood. The Goddess\'s old title, Sancta Ma- \ntrona Holy Mother was added to the canon of saints as a phony St. \nMatrona, whose pseudo-biography made her a "hermitess." 18 \n\n\n\n1050 \n\n\n\nThe primitive naivete of the virgin-birth concept was dressed in Virgo \n\npretentious verbiage, purporting to explain it, while actually hiding it Virtue \n\nfrom prying eyes. "A shadow is formed by light falling upon a body. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe Virgin, as a human being, could not hold the fulness of divinity; \nbut the power of the most High overshadowed her, while the incorpore- \nal light of the godhead took a human body within her, and so she was \nable to bear God." 19 \n\nChurchmen often presented the doctrine of the virgin birth as \n"ennobling" to women, since they viewed women\'s natural sexuality \nas degrading. Seldom were female sexuality and motherhood perceived \nas component parts of the same whole. Some women were astute \nenough to see that the doctrine effectively degraded real womanhood by \nexalting a never-attainable ideal. At the end of the 19th century one \nwoman wrote: \n\n/ think that the doctrine of the Virgin birth as something higher, sweeter, \nnobler than ordinary motherhood, is a slur on all the natural mother- \nhood of the world. . . . Out of this doctrine, and that which is akin to it, \nhave sprung all the monasteries and nuns of the world, which have \ndisgraced and distorted and demoralized manhood and womanhood for a \nthousand years. I place beside this false, monkish, unnatural claim . . . \nmy mother, who was as holy in her motherhood as was Mary herself. 20 \n\nl.Briffault3, 169-70. 2. Budge, D.N., 169. 3.

Renaissance poets still called her Astraea: "She is that royal \nand great goddess by whom cities and empires are preserved in pride; \nwithout her no kingdom can long endure. This is she who makes them \nall secure." 2 \n\n1 . Lindsay, O.A., 277. 2. Moakley, 111. \n\n\n\nVirtue \n\nLatin virtu was derived from vir, "man," and originally meant \nmasculinity, impregnating power, semen, or male magic, like Germanic \nheill. Patriarchal thinkers defined manliness as good and womanliness \nas bad, therefore virtu became synonymous with morality or godliness, \nalong with other synonyms hinting at male sexuality: erectness, \n\n\n\n1051 \n\n\n\nvishnu uprightness, rectitude, upstandingness, etc. As the Old Testament said, \n\nVitus, Saint "Praise is comely for the upright" (Psalms 33:1). \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ Old phallic connotations of "virtue" may have been hidden in the \n\n"^ Gospels\' description of Jesus\'s miraculous cure of the woman with an \n\nissue of blood. When she touched Jesus, he felt "virtue" go out of him, \n"and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up" (Mark \n5:29-30). According to ancient systems of sacred kingship, it was \nimportant for the king-victim to give proof of virility, which meant \nimpregnating a specially chosen priestess, so that the "fountain of her \nblood" might cease. \n\n\n\nVishnu \n\nVedic god representing both the sacrificial boar and the phallus. His \nname meant "he who embraces, pervades, or penetrates"; he was \nknown as "the expander," and "he who excites men." l His emblem \nwas a lingam-yoni composed of a male cross with a female circle, called \nthe sign Kiakra: "When held by Vishnu, it signifies his power to \npenetrate heaven and earth." 2 \n\nVishnu insisted that his flesh and blood, poured out on the \nsacrificial altar, preserved the whole world, creatures and gods alike. \nWhen he transformed himself into the boar, he became the Universal \nSavior. For the sake of the world he gave himself up to death, and \nwas sacrificed by "gods saying Om." ? \n\nThe boar\'s tusk was identified with his phallus, because it was the \ntusk that effected Vishnu\'s mating with the primal Goddess Earth: \n"He uprose bearing on his tusk the fair goddess Earth, shedding in all \ndirections the brine of the cosmic sea." 4 Boars\' tusks often represent- \ned phalli in Oceanic and Far-Eastern cultures. \n\n1.

An emblem of \nthe Moon-goddess entered into the fabrication of St. Vitus as his \nalleged "nurse," Crescentia. \n\nVitus was especially venerated in Westphalia, where bones said to \nbe his had rested since the 9th century a.d., though his legend \nassigned him to the time of Diocletian, six hundred years earlier. The \nbones were credited with the ability to cure many diseases, especially \nchorea, the so-called St. Vitus\'s Dance. 1 \n\nl.Atrwater,338. \n\n\n\n1052 \n\n\n\nViviana, Saint Viviana, Saint \n\nCanonized form of the pagan Goddess Viviane, whose name meant \n\nLife. It seems to have been nothing more than a word on the Goddess\'s i \n\ntemple on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Probably an image of the \n\nGoddess, so labeled, was deliberately re-interpreted as the image of a \n\n"virgin martyr." 1 \n\nAmong early medieval Celtic poets, Viviane was the name of the \nLady of the Lake, who reappeared in Arthurian myths as another \nform of Nimue, the "Nemesis" of Merlin. \n\nl.Attwater, 338. \n\n\n\nVolsi \n\n"Horse\'s Penis," a title of Odin as the castrated royal horse, whose \namputated member became the ancestor of the Volsungs. Welsh \nequivalents were the Waelsings, sons of Waels, who later became \n"the god Wales." Waels also meant "the Corpse," for the dead god was \nalways resurrected and became the usual Lord of Death, like Shiva\'s \ncorpse-form Shava. See Horse. \n\n\n\nVulcan \n\nLatin lightning- or volcano-god derived from Cretan Velchanos, \nidentical with Hephaestus. Vulcan\'s forges were said to lie under Mt. \nEtna or Mt. Vesuvius. See Lightning; Smith. He evolved into the \nmedieval "Volund the Smith," a divine wizard whom the British called \nWayland. \n\n\n\nVulture \n\nOne of the oldest totems of the Great Mother in Egypt was the \nvulture, eater of the dead. Vultures who devoured corpses were regard- \ned as her angels of death, since they carried the dead piecemeal to \nheaven. In Neolithic times it was a common practice to expose dead \nbodies to carrion birds, who embodied the Mother\'s spirit. For this \nreason even the Greeks and Romans fostered a belief that all vultures \nare female. 1 On the Stele of the Vultures from Catal Huyuk, 7th \nmillenium B.C., dead bodies are carried off by vultures in a time and \nplace where only the female principle was worshipped. 2 \n\nAncient Iranians didn\'t bury their dead, but exposed them to \nvultures in open-topped "towers of silence" called dakhmas, many of \nwhich still stand today. Such towers were built when Iranians wor- \nshipped the Moon-goddess Mah, the Mother, and believed that \n\n\n\n1053 \n\n\n\nVulture vultures carried the deceased to her heavenly realm. 5 Even after burial \n\nwas instituted in Persia, a dead body couldn\'t be interred until it was \n^ ^^^ Im first torn by vultures.* \n\nEgyptians worshipped the vulture-headed Mother as the origin of \nall things, calling her Mut, Isis, or Nekhbet. 5 In combination with the \nserpent goddess Buto (Per-Uatchet), the vulture-mother gave rise to the \nTwo Mistresses, guardians of royal dynastic clans, and nurses of \ndeceased kings in the after-life. Temples had special chapels for the \nTwo Mistresses: on the east, the serpent Goddess brought the sun to \nbirth; on the west, the vulture Goddess daily ordained his death. 6 \nSometimes both Goddesses appeared as vultures on the sacred mount \nof Sehseh, where the deceased pharaoh became an eternal infant at \ntheir breasts. 7 \n\nEgypt\'s oldest oracle was the shrine of the vulture goddess Nekh- \nbet at Nekhen (modern Al-Kab), the original "necropolis" or city of \nthe dead. Because it was a birth shrine as well as a death shrine, Greeks \ncalled it Ilithyiaspolis after their own Great Mother of childbirth, \nAphrodite Ilithyia. 8 Romans called it Civitas Lucinae, the city of Juno \nLucina, Goddess of childbirth. 9 \n\nEgypt\'s symbol for "grandmother" was the vulture goddess bear- \ning a flail of authority: a totemic form of the pre-dynastic clan \nmatriarch. 10 The word "mother" was written in hieroglyphics with the \nsign of the vulture. 11 Nekhbet the Vulture once ruled all of Upper \nEgypt, wearing the white crown in token of sovereignty. As Isis, she \nappeared in vulture form on mummy-pillows, crowned with a vulture \nskin and bearing in each claw the ankh or Cross of Life. 12 As a vulture \nshe devoured her dead consort Osiris, just as Kali devoured her dead \nShiva. 13 Then she reincarnated him in her body, and gave him rebirth \nas a new Holy Child, Horus. \n\nOsiris was dismembered, which was the funerary custom of primi- \ntive Egypt, dating from a remote time when the dead probably were \neaten, after the manner of primitive Greece\'s omophagia. Funerary \nmagic lay in the hands of dancing priestesses called muu, "mothers," \nwho may have worn costumes of vulture feathers to represent "eaters" \nand, like Isis, reconstitute the dead in their own bodies. The Book of \nAni said the first gate of the uterine underworld was guarded by the \nvulture Goddess, whose tearing beak could admit the dead to the \nplace whence they rose again. 14 \n\nThe vulture-mother was known also in northern Europe and Asia. \nValkyries were "corpse-eaters" to the Saxons and often took the form \nof carrion-eating birds such as crows or ravens. In Siberia, each shaman \nhad a "Bird-of-Prey Mother" who appeared twice in his life, at his \nspiritual death-and-rebirth like the Dove-mother appearing at Jesus\'s \nbaptismal ceremony and again at his physical death. This spirit- \nmother was a large carrion bird "with an iron beak, hooked claws, and a \nlong tail." 15 \n\nFunerary priestesses came to be called "dirty" in classic myths, as \n\n\n\n1054 \n\n\n\nthey appear in the tale of the vulture-feathered Harpies. However, Vulture \n\nthe ancient claim that all vultures are female was believed well into the \n\nChristian era. Church fathers cited, in defense of the Virgin Birth, ^ ^ m M \n\nthe "fact" that vultures conceived their eggs only because they were \n\nfertilized by spirits of the wind. 16 \n\nl.Budge,G.E.2,372. 2. de Riencourt, 24. 3.

Saint Walburga \n\n\n\nWalpurga, Saint \n\nChristianization of the pagan Goddess of Walpurgisnacht (May \nEve), the orgiastic festival of the springtime sacred marriage. Walpurga \nwas the May Queen whose cult remained so popular in Germany \nthat the church had to adopt her in its usual way, by a spurious \ncanonization. According to the canonical legend, she was an English- \nwoman who became supreme abbess of the double monastery of \nHeidenheim during the 8th century; but there were no contemporary \nrecords of the time when this "abbess" was supposed to have lived and \nreigned. 1 \n\nIn the 8th century, however, double monasteries largely perpetuat- \ned the pagan traditions of the "colleges" of priests and priestesses \nliving together under a female ruler, and apparently carrying on the \nancient sex rites under a thin veil of Christian-pagan syncretism. 2 \n(See Convent.) The name of Walpurga\'s monastery means literally \n"home of heathens." \n\nThe medieval church produced and sold vast quantities of an \nallegedly miraculous Oil of St. Walpurga, which exuded so it was \nclaimed from the holy rock under which the saint\'s bones lay, and \nwhich was highly recommended for the purpose of healing many \nkinds of diseases. 3 \n\nThe saint\'s day was transferred from May Eve to February, \npossibly in an attempt to discourage the Walpurgisnacht revels; but \n"witches" celebrated the original date of the marriage-festival anyway, \nin honor of Walpurga. Therefore the church had to claim that May \nEve commemorated the transfer of St. Walpurga\'s relics to Eichstatt so \nthe processions and dances and songs would seem to be associated \nwith the progress of a revered reliquary. 4 May Eve, however, remained \na prime festival of witches throughout all Europe. \n\n1.

Attwater, 339. \n\n\n\nWar \n\nA primary patriarchal contribution to culture, almost entirely absent \nfrom the matriarchal societies of the Neolithic and early Bronze Ages. 1 \nEven when Goddess-worship was beginning to give way to cults of \naggressive gods, for a long time the appearance of the Goddess imposed \npeace on all hostile groups. Among Germanic tribes in Europe, \nTacitus said, whenever the Goddess moved in her chariot at certain \nseasons to certain sacred places, the people "do not go to battle or \nwear arms; every weapon is under lock; peace and quiet are known and \nwelcomed." 2 In later centuries, one of the reasons for the devaluation \nof women in feudal Europe was that the feudal system was based on \nwar, in which women played no part except as victims. 3 \n\nPatriarchal gods tended to be warlike from their inception \n\n\n\n1058 \n\n\n\nincluding, or even particularly, the Judeo-Christian God. Stanton \nobserved that the Old Testament\'s account of God\'s nature, purpose, \nand activities on behalf of his Chosen People boils down to "a long \npainful record of war, corruption, rapine, and lust. Why Christians who \nwished to convert the heathen to our religion should send them these \nbooks, passes all understanding." 4 \n\nBut Christianity was never a pacifist religion. The church placed \nwarfare in its armory of persecution as soon as its political power \nmade this possible. Pope Innocent I (d. 417) proclaimed that God gave \nthe church the right to kill, and permitted papal armies to employ the \nsword "for the punishment of the guilty," which meant massacre of the \nnonorthodox. 5 The warfare of Christian sect against Christian sect \nwas unremitting, so that pagan observers said Christians behaved toward \neach other with the ferocity of wild beasts. 6 These trends continued \nthroughout the Christian era, under the headings of holy wars, crusades, \nconquests, and conversions by the sword. All-male Christianity was \ndisseminated by violence. 7 \n\nMeanwhile, with the decline of their religious power and the \nobliteration of their Goddess, women helplessly disapproved, as many \ndo today. An American black woman recently said: \n\n/ don \'t think a few should control everything. I don \'t think it\'s right that \nwomen lay down and bear sons and then you have a few rich people \nthat tell your sons they have to go and die for their country. They\'re not \ndying for their country. They\'re dying for the few to stay on top. I don \'t \nthink that\'s necessary. I\'m just tired of this type of thing. I just think we \nought to be just human. s \n\nIn contrast to these sentiments, there was a more masculine \nopinion published in Marinetti\'s "manifesto of futurism" in the follow- \ning terms: "we want to extol the love of danger. . . . There is no \nbeauty apart from conflict. There are no masterpieces without aggres- \nsion. . . . We want to extol war the world\'s only hygiene \nmilitarism, patriotism, the anarchist\'s destructive gesture, the glorious, \ndeath-giving ideas and contempt for women!" 9 \n\nSome women accepted the contempt and tamely submitted to the \nGod and the man who extolled war, even giving up their children \nwithout protest, like housewife Jesusita Novarro: \n\nI pray a lot. I pray to God to give me strength. If He should take a child \naway from me, to have the strength to accept it. It\'s His kid. He just \nborrowed him to me. . . . \n\nThese kids don \'t ask to be born these kids are gonna grow up and \ngive their lives one day. . . . There will always be war. Why? I really \ndon \'t know. Nobody has ever told me. . . . I wish I knew. I guess the big \nshots decided the war. ,0 \n\nMore articulate women have spoken out against the "big shots" \nwho seem to leave the life-affirming interests of women out of their \nplans for the future, calling their power-mania gynocidal and therefore \n\n\n\nWar \n\n\n\nFilippo Tommaso \nMarinetti (1876-1944) \nItalian founder of the \nliterary Futurist move- \nment; supporter of \nFascism; self-described \nas a "mystic of \naction." \n\n\n\n1059 \n\n\n\nWar \n\n\n\ngenocidal. 11 It is often implied that only women can take on the \nresponsibility of defying the war machines, to save their children; but \nagain women are placed in a no-win situation when they have no \npower to enforce their defiance. \n\nWith the advance of technological civilization, as everyone \nknows, wars have become deadlier than ever, as if the mind of man \nbecomes less "civilized" as his tools become more so. Some have \ndoubted that man is capable of constructing a stable, peaceful world. \nBecker remarked, "It seems that the experiment of man may well \nprove to be an evolutionary dead end, an impossible animal." n Jules \nHenry said: \n\nIs there nothing in life in an achieving culture but constant war war \nagainst the outside as the fullest expression of the drive, and war on the \ninside to contain and transform it? The grisly history of achieving cultures \ndoes not permit anything but the affirmation: No, there is nothing \nmore. Though the inner and the outer war continue, the outer has so far \nbeen most successful, and the history of the achievement drive shows \nthat Homo sapiens has been dying of success and will probably fail as a \nspecies because of it. n \n\nTeilhard de Chardin wondered whether some historical error \nmight have brought man to a wrong turning in the path of progress, so \nthat violence of the modern world betrays "a certain excess, inexpli- \ncable to our reason, as if to the normal effect of evolution is added the \nextraordinary effect of some catastrophe or primordial deviation." H It \nis not difficult to find such a deviation in the contrast between "matrist" \nand "patrist" societies, especially in their respective valuations of \nelemental caring behavior. \n\nThe fundamental problem of mankind is to develop a culture where the \nneeds of the individual are always complementary to those around him; \na culture in which a child is not slapped for crying; a culture in which \nsorrow always is met by the complementary need to be compassionate; \nwhere fear is always met by the complementary need in others to give \nreassurance; where the need to be loved is met by a need to give love in \nthe way it is wanted, at the time it is wanted and as much as it is wanted. \nThis is not an American view, for the American makes conflict into a \ngod; and although sociology swells its chest with a thousand "conflict \ntheories, "it has none on compassion. . . . Life without conflict seems \nstale to the American elites; and compassion, which is a low-paid motiva- \ntion, has been relegated to the fringes of the low-paid segments of the \nculture, and has never been a subject for research. ,s \n\nThe highest-paid pursuits of the modern age tend to exploit \nviolence either directly or in symbol, as Arthur Miller observed: \n\nThere is violence because we have daily honored violence. Any half- \neducated man in a good suit can make his fortune by concocting a \ntelevision show whose brutality is photographed in sufficiently monstrous \ndetail. Who produces these shows, who pays to sponsor, who is \nhonored for acting in them? Are these people delinquent psychopaths \n\n\n\n1060 \n\n\n\nslinking along tenement streets? No, they are the pillars of society, our War \n\nhonored men, our exemplars of success and social attainment. We must \n\nbegin to feel the shame and contrition we have earned before we can ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nbegin to sensibly construct a peaceful society, let alone a peaceful world. A \n\ncountry where people cannot walk safely in their own streets has not \n\nearned the right to tell any other people how to govern itself, let alone to \n\nbomb and burn that people. 16 \n\nSome observers of the modern scene fear that the symbolism of \nviolence, so prevalent in what passes for "entertainment" in our \naggressive society, will actually create its social counterpart because of \nman\'s propensity to model his behavior on symbolic forms. Mumford \nsays: \n\nPower and order, pushed to their final limit, lead to their self-destructive \ninversion: disorganization, violence, mental aberration, subjective \nchaos. This tendency is already expressed in America through the motion \npicture, the television screen, and children \'s comic books. These forms \nof amusement are all increasingly committed to enactments of cold- \nblooded brutality and physical violence: pedagogical preparations for \nthe practical use of homicide and genocide. . . . Was it not in the country \nmost disciplined by militarism, absolutism, and physical science that \nsystematic torture in the form of "scientific experiments" was undertaken? \nDid not Germany produce the nauseating horrors of the extermination \ncamps? In the combination of cold scientific rationalism with criminal \nirrationalism the fatal poison produced its equally fatal antidote. \' 7 \n\nThe rise of Hitler\'s Germany provides an interesting case in \npoint, showing a nation swept by militaristic sentiment coupled with a \nsense of divine mission. The churches accepted Hitler\'s warmonger- \ning with religious joy. In April 1937, a Christian organization in the \nRhineland passed a resolution that Hitler\'s word was the law of God \nand possessed "divine authority." Reichsminister for Church Affairs \nHans Kerrl announced: "There has arisen a new authority as to what \n\nChrist and Christianity really are that is Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler \n\nis the true Holy Ghost." 18 And so the pious gave him their blessing, and \nthe churches gave him God\'s. "Organized religion has always man- \naged to provide prayers and thanks for victories in bloody wars. ... In \nmore recent history, is there any evidence that organized religion \nanywhere did anything but bless the battlers on both sides?" 19 \n\nIn fact, Nazism was not the creation of Hitler alone, nor even of \nGermany alone. The Nazi myth of "pure Aryanism" began not with \na German but with a Frenchman, Comte de Gobineau, who claimed in \n1853 that the divinely chosen Master Race, of Teutonic stock, had \nbeen defiled by admixtures of inferior, swarthy peoples: Latins, Ne- \ngroes, Semites. Teutons would "naturally" rule the world once these \ninferior strains were purged from their Aryan bloodlines. \n\nGermans founded Gobineau societies all over their country, and \ndeveloped a new nationalistic pride out of the myth of the Teutonic \nUbermensch. The myth was further elaborated by an Englishman, \n\n\n\n1061 \n\n\n\nWar \n\n\n\nH. S. Chamberlain, who wrote The Foundation of the Nineteenth \nCentury in 1899, giving a "scientific" rationale for the awful conse- \nquences of racial mixture, especially the contamination of "exalted \nAryans" by Semitic blood. Chamberlain married Wagner\'s daughter \nEva, and became a German citizen. Kaiser Wilhelm praised him, and \ncalled Chamberlain\'s book his favorite reading. Clearly, it was also a \nfavorite of Hitler\'s. \n\nThe Gobineau-Chamberlain-Hitler theory of the Ubermensch \nshows one of the most common underlying causes of war: man\'s \npropensity to view himself and his own group as superior to others, who \ntherefore deserve destruction because they are substandard. Once the \npropaganda machine begins to work, there is no limit to the depravity it \ncan impute to the enemy not wholly without reason, for war \ncorrupts everyone including one\'s own troops, though this fact is \ninvariably overlooked. War is an outstanding example of the We- \nThey syndrome: the Saved versus the Damned, the Chosen People \nversus the heathen, God\'s champions against the forces of evil (even \nwhen God is on both sides). Hitler succeeded brilliantly in convincing \nhis followers that his political enemies were subhumans (Untermens- \nchen), therefore it was only reasonable to exterminate them. 20 \n\nIn a sense this indoctrination can extend even to the enemy\'s \nhomeland, which can be seen as a non-country whereas according \nto the patriotic ideal one\'s own country is the most superior spot on \nMother Earth\'s body, the essential cunnus as primitives believed, a \nparadise on earth. Such maternal symbolism has even been used to good \neffect in developing desirable sentiments of aggression in wartime, as \nshown by the writing of a California superintendent of schools: \n\nThe good citizen stands in relation to his country as the good son to his \nmother. \n\nHe obeys her because she is his elder, because she conjoins within \nherself the vision of many, and because he owes to her his begetting \nand his nurturing. \n\nHe honors her above all others, placing her in a special niche within \nhis secret heart, in front of which the candles of respect and admiration \nare forever kept alight. \n\nHe defends her against all enemies, and counts his life well lost in \nher behalf 21 \n\nSuch utilization of the powerful Mother-symbol on behalf of \nmilitarism tends to conceal the real aggressors from their real victims. As \nwomen seem to know almost instinctively, the former are the "big \nshots" mature men in positions of power. The latter are the younger, \nhandsomer, more virile rivals the sons who can be made obedient \nsoldiers and sent off to be destroyed, which may defuse the Oedipal \njealousy. In effect, war is a gentlemen\'s agreement between the \nauthority figures on both sides that they will kill off each other\'s youths, \nand even win social approval or adulation for doing so. 22 \n\n\n\n1062 \n\n\n\nPatriarchal males have always shown hostility to the young, who War \n\ndivert the attention of females, either as mates or mothers. In the \n\nwest, male aggression against the young is sometimes projected onto ^^^mm^^ma^^m \n\nwomen: for example, accusing women of murder in the case of \nabortion, or of crime in the case of birth control. Both these measures \ntended to diminish the patriarchs\' supply of cannon fodder. Margaret \nSanger thought women could end war by "cutting off the surplus \npeople. Of course military states always clamor for more children, \nfirst to defend the Fatherland, and when the population soars, to \nconquer more territory for the added millions." 23 But the goals of a \nmilitaristic state would not be served by women who deliberately denied \nit the necessary population base; the state wanted quantity, not \nquality. \n\nReligion of the patriarchal sort was, and is, always on the side of \nthe patriarchs. Vetter says, "There is little to choose between the \nhead-hunting which keeps down the number of people to be supported \nby the game produced in a given area, and the periodic wholesale \nslaughter engaged in by \'civilized\' peoples in their battles for the control \nof equally vital economic resources, and for which slaughters the \nblessings of our religions have never failed to be forthcoming." 24 \n\nWars are begun by elite males and carried out by those of lower \nstatus, while priesthoods bless the effort. "It is a fair estimate that 100 \nmillion people have been killed by war since 1900. Responsibility for \nthis mass slaughter rests directly upon the male members of the \nspecies." 25 Yet war is never reasonable, as males imagine their actions to \nbe. "Destruction of the world by a small group of white men in order \nto achieve more wealth than they can ever possibly use does not make \nsense. We are talking here about a drive for power, a need for \ndomination that must be examined. ... In squelching female energy, \npatriarchy creates a culture that is destructive and death-oriented." 26 \nToday "we see the threat of nuclear annihilation more serious than ever \nafter two decades of disarmament efforts. We realize that science and \ntechnology cannot save us, at least not as currently administered by \nmen. The design for disaster we currently face was not planned by \nwomen." 27 \n\nIn the Tantric morality which probably was planned by women, at \nleast in part, war is entirely unacceptable. The adept may not \nparticipate in fighting or in the manufacture of weapons; he must not \nglorify soldiers\' bravery, nor praise killing in a hunt or a battle. These \n"constitute a worse form of murder since they incite others to do it, thus \nharming their spiritual growth." 28 With modern films and television \nstill trying to glorify violence, it seems the Tantric sages had already \nachieved a deeper understanding of human nature than those of our \n"enlightened" modern world. \n\nl.Fromm, 158. 2.

Tatz & Kent, 3 1 . \n\n\n\nWaste Land \n\nThe recurrent threatening theme of medieval romances was the \nWaste Land motif, especially in the Holy Grail cycle. Like the Grail \nlegends themselves," the Waste Land motif probably came from the \nMiddle East, where European travelers and crusaders had seen a true \nWaste Land: the great desert which eastern mystics attributed to \nIslam\'s renunciation of the fertile Great Mother. Western pagans also \nmaintained that if the Mother should be offended or neglected, she \nmight curse the land with the same desperate barrenness that could be \nseen in Arabia Deserta and north Africa. (See Grail, Holy.) \n\nOne of the Grail stories said a king of England (Logres) once \ncommitted a mortal sin by raping one of the Goddess\'s priestesses \nand stealing her golden cup, symbol of her love, which must not be \nstolen but only given. Afterward, priestesses of the sacred springs no \nlonger welcomed wayfarers with food and drink. 1 The Peace of the \nGoddess was destroyed, for the women no longer trusted men. "The \nland went to waste. The trees lost their leaves, grass and flowers \nwithered, and the water receded more and more. ... [A] wrong \nagainst a feminine being and a plundering of nature were perpetrated. . . . \n[T]he origin of the trouble was looked upon as an offense committed \nagainst the fairy world, i.e., actually against nature. . . . The growth of \nmasculine consciousness and of the patriarchal logos principle of the \nChristian outlook are concerned in no small measure with this \ndevelopment." 2 \n\nThe Goddess appeared in several myths of the Grail cycle as a \ngreat lady disinherited, or a queen robbed of her possessions and \nreduced to penury, like La Reine de la Terre Gaste (Queen of the \nWaste Land) in the Cistercian romance of the Queste del Saint Graal} \nMany tales speak of groups of women deprived of their former property \nrights and gathered together in "castles of damsels," under three rulers \npersonifying the Goddess: a queen, her daughter, and her \ngranddaughter. \n\nHoping to keep their enemies at bay by magic spells, the woman \nwaited for a champion to defend their cause, as the Grail knights were \nsupposed to do. The queen employed a certain learned astronomer \nwhose wizardry kept away from the castle any knight likely to fail \nthrough cowardice, envy, greed, or any other weakness of character. \nThe ladies waited for the coming of their savior, the Desired Knight, \nperfect in his honesty and bravery: one who could destroy all their \nenemies and restore their lands and possessions, which had been taken \nfrom them by various robber barons. "Orphaned maidens," deprived of \n\n\n\n1064 \n\n\n\ntheir inheritance by new patrilineal laws, also took refuge in such castles Waste Land \n\nof women; so did older widows who were no longer permitted to inherit \n\nproperty as under the former laws of mother-right. 4 m ^^^ mt ^ m ^^^ mm \n\nLegends of the coming of the Desired Knight may have been \npromulgated by women, or by bards seeking to please women with a \nfavorite theme. But there was more than this to the image of the Waste \nLand. It haunted a society in which, "Under the autocratic regime of \npersecuting Christianity during the Middle Ages of Europe, Christian \ndogma was indeed accepted nominally by great intellects, but it was \naccepted under duress and with a reservation. . . . The men of highest \nintellect were compelled to express the faith that was in them in the \nmost guarded language." 5 Often, the language was symbolism the \nmost guarded of all, since its true meaning could always be denied. The \nsymbolic Waste Land was "a landscape of spiritual death," where \nreligious concepts were dissociated from the feelings and life experi- \nences of ordinary people, and imposed upon a confused, reluctant \npublic only by authoritarian indoctrination. 6 \n\nThis could well describe Europe in the 1 2th century, when the \ncoming of the Desired Knight was vaguely identified with the second \ncoming of Christ or Merlin, Arthur, Frederick, etc. Many oppressed \npeople despairingly yearned for a powerful hero to defy the oppressors \non their behalf. The Waste Land theme invoked the collective fear of \nevery agricultural society since the Stone Age: the fear that Mother \nEarth\'s cyclic miracle of food production might fail. But it meant more \nthan that. It also stood for collective devitalization and depression in a \nsociety perceived by its members as lacking spiritual roots. \n\nA famous modern application of the Waste Land theme is, of \ncourse, T.S. Eliot\'s poem, based not only on western applications of \nGrail symbolism but also on the Hindu tale of the hopeless quest for the \ntrue Word of Power, as recounted in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. \nThe Hindu version ran like this: \n\nGods, men, and demons went to Shiva-Prajapati in the guise of \nLord of Thunder, to find out from him the ultimate word that is, the \nword signifying the goal and end of all things, as Om signified their \nbeginning. But the Thunder, being thunder, was not able to say any \nword except one: Da. \n\nMen, hearing this word, thought it meant datta, meaning "give" or \n"fertilize," because begetting was the only divine thing they could do, \nand charitable giving was the only way they knew to seek blessedness. \nDemons, hearing this word, thought it meant dayadhvam, meaning \n"sympathize" or "be compassionate"; in the Oriental context demons \nwere not evil spirits but deities of the old matriarchal religion, who \npreached karuna, mother-love. Gods, hearing this word, thought it \nmeant damyata, meaning "control," the secret of their success; by self- \ncontrol they became divine, and by divinity they achieved power to \ncontrol all the others. \n\nBut the Lord of Thunder couldn\'t distinguish one word from \n\n\n\n1065 \n\n\n\nWater another. He only repeated mindlessly the only word he knew: "Da! Da! \n\nWeird Sisters Da!" 7 \n\n1 Spence 138. 2. Jung & von Franz, 202, 204. 3. Campbell, CM., 543. \n^^^"^^^^ i. Jung &\'von Franz, 229. 5.

Upanishads, 112. \n\n\n\nWater \n\nFirst of the elements, according to the philosophers of ancient \nMiletus; the Arche, mother of all things. 1 Water gave birth to "spirit," \nsupposedly a male principle; hence the idea of baptismal rebirth that \nChristians copied from the pagans involved both water (feminine) and \nspirit (masculine). The baptismal font was described as a "womb," \nspecifically the womb of Mary, whose name was that of all the ancient \nSea-goddesses. 2 Most myths placed the primary impulse of creation \nin a watery womb of chaos or "formlessness" representing the Great \nMother (Tiamat, Kali, Ma-Nu, Themis, etc.), an image really drawn \nfrom the lack of differentiation between self and other or self and \nmother experienced by the infant in the womb and subconsciously \nremembered throughout life as an archetypal image. The Mother-letter \nM (Ma) was an ideogram for waves of water. \n\n"Students of mythology find that when the feminine principle is \nsubjected to sustained attack, as it was from the medieval Christian \nauthorities, it often quietly submerges. Under the water (where organic \nlife began) it swims through the subconscious of the dominant male \nsociety, occasionally bobbing to the surface to offer a glimpse of the \nrejected harmony." 3 \n\nCorrespondence between "water" and "mother" was so universal \neven in the Middle Ages, when the maternal principle was theoreti- \ncally squelched, that the Hermetic magicians and other "philosophers" \nclaimed souls were created not by God, but by the maternal earth and \nmaternal waters. 4 Goddess-shrines were nearly always associated with \nwells, springs, lakes, or seas. 5 The Lady of the Lake was identical with \nMinne/Aphrodite, the Minnesingers\' Goddess of Love, who appeared \nas a mermaid and was assumed to have a "nature of water." Often, \nwater was a metaphor for love itself. Like water, love stayed with the \nman who held it loosely, as in an open, cupped hand; but the man \nwho tried to grip it hard, in his fist, found that it flowed away and left \nhim gripping nothing. And water, like love, was essential to the life- \nforces of fertility and creativity, without which the psychic world as well \nas the material world would become an arid desert, the Waste Land. \n\n1.

Weird was a Saxon name of the death-goddess or \n\nCrone, who often stood for the whole trinity. Her name was variously ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ngiven as Wyrd, or Wurd, or Urd, meaning both "Earth" and the Word \n\nof Fate\'s immutable law. 1 As Beowulf said, "Every man in this life \n\nwill go lay him down on the bed where Wyrd has decided to nail him." 2 \n\nThis passage from an early Saxon romance might throw light on \nthe eastern yogi\'s celebrated bed of nails, symbol of his submission to \nthe Goddess. Devotion to the Fates and their decrees often brought \nforth a "passionate surrender" in both eastern and western mystics: \n"This eagerness to submit to divine Fate inspired certain souls in days of \nold with feelings so fervent as to recall the rapture of Christian \ndevotion, which burns to subject itself to the will of God." 3 Fate was \nkarma, a concept virtually identical with that of Weird. \n\nBeowulf was written in a pagan era, but it received later Christian \nadditions. For instance, Beowulf said once that the Goddess Wyrd \nwould determine the outcome of his battle; then he said that God \nwould. The Triple Goddess was much opposed by churchmen of the \ntime. A 12th-century Bishop of Exeter scolded his people for inviting \nthe Three Sisters into the house after a birth, to cast a good destiny \nfor the newborn, and making offerings to them on a table prepared \n"with three knives for the service of the fairies." 4 \n\nNevertheless, the Fairy Godmothers or Weird Sisters continued to \nbe invited. Four centuries later in Tudor England, they were still \nprayed to appear at the cradle of a newborn infant, "for to set to the \nbabe what shall befall to him." 5 \n\n1. Campbell, Oc.M., 485. 2.

Hazlirt, 379. \n\n\n\nWells \n\nSprings, fountains, ponds, wells were always female symbols in \narchaic religions, often considered water-passages to the underground \nwomb, in northern Europe associated with Mother Hel, whose name \nalso gave rise to "holy" and "healing." Many pagan sacred springs \nthroughout England received the name of Helen\'s Well during \nChristian times, and churchmen claimed all these wells were named \nafter Empress Helena, Constantine\'s sainted mother. But the real \n"Helen" was Hel, or Dame Holle, whose water-womb was called the \nsource of all the children on earth. 1 \n\nThere were also many wells named after the Goddesses Morgan \nand Brigit. Coventina, "Mother of the Covens," was associated with \nhealing wells. Margaret, a traditional witch name, also designated wells \nand springs. Lancashire legend speaks of a statue called Peg o\' the \nWell beside a formerly holy spring in Ribblesdale, said to claim a human \nsacrifice every seven years. 2 Ecclesiastical canons of the 10th century \n\n\n\n1067 \n\n\n\nWerewolf \n\n\n\nexpressly forbade "well-worshippings," but they continued \nnonetheless. 5 \n\nThe Danish poem Water of Life drew on the pagan tradition of \nresurrection through the Mother-symbol of a sacred well called \nHileva (Hel-Eve). With this magic water, a divine queen put her \ndismembered lover back together and made him live again, as Isis did \nfor Osiris. 4 The grotto and fountain of Lourdes once had a similar \npagan tradition, now revamped to the service of the church. \n\nIn 1770 a curate of Brpmlield forbade pagan ceremonies, wakes, \nand fairs at a spring calle<rHellywell (Hel\'s Well), to which site the \nceremonies had been moved after they were evicted from the church- \nyard at a still earlier date. 5 The ceremonies had been going on for a \nvery long time. A medieval Life of St. Columba mentioned them in \nconnection with a fountain-shrine "famous among this heathen \npeople, which foolish men, blinded by the devil, worshipped as a \ndivinity." 6 \n\n1.

Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the an- \ncient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nWerewolf \n\nBelief in the werewolf, or "spirit-wolf," probably began with early- \nmedieval wolf clans who worshipped their totemic gods in wolf form, as \ndid some people of the Greco-Roman world centuries earlier. Zeus \nLycaeus, or Lycaeon, was a Pelasgian wolf-king who reigned in a nine- \nyear cycle as spouse of the Ninefold Goddess, Nonacris. 1 Virgil said \nthe first werewolf was Moeris, spouse of the trinitarian Fate-goddess \n(Moera), from whom he learned secrets of magic, including the \nnecromantic knack of calling up the dead from their tombs. 2 \n\nLycanthropy (werewolfism) was named for Apollo Lycaeus, \n"Wolfish Apollo," who used to be worshipped in the famous Ly- \nceum or "Wolf-temple" where Socrates taught. 3 Apollo was mated to \nArtemis as a divine Wolf Bitch at Troezen, where she purified \nOrestes with the blood of nine sacrificial victims. 4 Pausanias said Apollo \nwas originally an Egyptian deity, deriving his name from Up-Uat \n(Ap-ol), a very ancient name of Anubis. 5 (See Dog.) \n\nAnother Roman version of the wolf god was Dis Pater, Soranus, or \nFeronius, consort of the Sabine underground Goddess Feronia, \n"Mother of Wolves." A certain Roman family claimed descent from \nher Sabine priestesses, and annually demonstrated her power by \nwalking barefoot over glowing coals during the festival of the Feronia. 6 \nShe was also identified with Lupa the She- Wolf, whose spirit purified \nPalatine towns through the agency of young men in wolfskins, \nconsecrated by participating in the Lupercalia or Festival of the She- \nWolf. 7 \n\nThe She- Wolf was another aspect of the Triple Goddess, as \n\n\n\n1068 \n\n\n\nshown by her triadic motherhood. She gave three souls to her son, Werewolf \n\nthe legendary King Erulus or Herulus, so that when he was overthrown \n\nby Evander, he had to be killed three times. 8 The Amazons, who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nworshipped the Triple Goddess, incorporated a tribe called the Neuri, \n\nwho "turned themselves into wolves" for a few days each year during \n\ntheir main religious festival, presumably by wearing wolf skins and \n\nmasks. 9 The same story was told of a certain Irish tribe in Ossory, \n\nwho became wolf-people when attending their Yuletide feast, devouring \n\nthe flesh of cattle as wolves, and afterward regaining their human \n\nshape. "Giraldus Cambrensis relates this great wonder in detail, as in \n\noperation in his own time, and believed every word of it." 10 \n\nThe heathens\' devotion to ancestral wolf gods in Teutonic Europe \nis evinced by the popularity of such names as Wolf, Wulf, Wolfram, \nWolfburg, Aethelwulf, Wolfstein, etc. "Beowulf son of Beowulf," hero \nof the Anglo-Saxon epic, was called Scyld by the Danes, who said he \ncame from the waters in a basket like Romulus and Remus, foster-sons \nof the She- Wolf. 11 \n\nIrish tribes said their spiritual fathers were wolves, and for that \nreason they wore wolf skins and used wolves\' teeth for healing \namulets. Celtic folksongs tell of children or wives transformed into \nwolves. One whole tribe was said to assume wolf shape very seventh \nyear. 12 As Germanic "berserkers" could become bears by donning \nbearskins, so it was thought people could become wolves by donning \nwolf pelts. 1? \n\nIn Mercia during the 10th century a.d. there was a revival of \npagan learning under two druidic priests, one of whom was named \nWerwulf. 14 This name of "spirit-wolf " seems to have been applied to \nopponents of Christianity in general. About 1000 a.d., the word \n"werewolf" was taken to mean an outlaw. 15 \n\nSouth Slavs used to pass a newborn child through a wolfskin, \nsaying it was thus born of the She- Wolf. After their conversion to \nChristianity, the people claimed this ceremony would protect the child \nfrom witches. But its real purpose, obviously, was to assimilate the \nchild to the wolf totem via a second birth from the wolf. 16 \n\nLivonians said witches routinely transformed themselves into \nwolves by passing through a certain magic pool, another instance of \nbaptismal rebirth in animal form. 17 Polish legend said a witch could \ntransform a bride and groom into wolves by laying a girdle of human \nskin across the threshold at their wedding feast. Later they would \nreceive dresses of fur and would regain their human shape at will. 18 \nAgainst such totemic ceremonies the 7th-century Council of Toledo \nissued severe denunciations of people who put on the heads of beasts, \nor "make themselves into wild animals." 19 \n\nItalian peasants still say a man who sleeps outdoors on Friday \nunder a full moon will be attacked by a werewolf, or will become one \nhimself. Friday was the night of the Goddess, and the warning against \nher lunar influence probably dated back to the myth of Endymion \n\n\n\n1069 \n\n\n\nWerewolf \n\n\n\nThe werewolf was \nknown to every Indo- \nEuropean language: \nDanish var-ulf, Gothic \nvaira-ulf, Old Nor- \nman wargus, Servian \nwlkoslak, Slovakian \nvlkodhk, Russian waw- \nkalak, Greek \nvrykolaki, Romanian \nvarcolaci, French \nloup-garou, Italian lupo \nmanaro, German \nWahr-Wdlffe." Shvk \nterms descended \nfrom volkhvi, a title of \nthe shamans who \nheld important positions \nin tribal life before \nChristianity. Cognates \nare German Volk, \n"people," and Russian \nvrach, "physician" \nindicating that were- \nwolves were people: \ntotemic healers in wolf \nmasks. 24 Similar \n"medicine men" are \nstill found among all \nprimitives. \n\n\n\n("Seduced Moon-Man"), who fell asleep on her holy moon-mountain \nand became her enchanted bridegroom, never to wake up again, so \nthe Goddess could shower her kisses on him each night. 20 \n\nAnother story traceable to wolf-clan traditions was "Little Red \nRiding Hood." The giveaway details are the red garment, the \noffering of food to a "grandmother" in the deep woods a grandmother \nwho wore a wolfskin and the cannibalistic motif of devouring and \nresurrection. In Britain, "a red woven hood" was the distinguishing \nmark of a prophetess or priestess. 21 The story\'s original victim would \nhave been not the red-clad Virgin but the hunter, as Lord of the Hunt. \nLike Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood was part of a Virgin- \nMother-Crone trinity, wearing the same red garment that Virgin Kali \nwore; as the red moon of a lunar eclipse she prophesied catastrophe \nand inspired much fear. Romanian churchmen declared that the \neclipsed moon was reddened by her own blood, shed when her \nwolves attacked her, to "make men repent and turn from evil." 22 \n\nThe Gaulish Diana had numerous wolf-cultists among her vota- \nries, in both ancient and medieval times. Under her totemic name of \nLupa she was a Mother of wild animals, and certain women seem to \nhave impersonated her in southern France. A Provencal troubadour \nnamed Pierre Vidal wrote a love poem to a lady of Carcassonne, whose \nname was Loba, "She- Wolf ": \n\nWhen loup-garou the rabble call me, \nWhen vagrant shepherds hoot, \nPursue, and buffet me to boot, \nIt doth not for a moment gall me, \nI seek not palaces nor halls, \nOr refuge when the winter falls; \nExposed to winds and frosts at night, \nMy soul is ravaged with delight. \nMe claims my she-wolf so divine; \nAnd justly she that claim prefers, \nFor, by my troth, my life is hers \nMore than another\'s, more than mine. 25 \n\nLovers of the She- Wolf sometimes found her on a holy moun- \ntain, which the gypsies called Monte Lupo, Wolf-Mountain. Young \nmen could learn the secrets of magic by celebrating the sacred \nmarriage: masturbating over the Goddess\'s statue and ejecting semen on \nit. She would guide and protect them, provided they never again set \nfoot in a Christian church. 26 Her votaries\' shape-shifting followed the \nphases of the moon, which was another form of the Goddess herself. \nIn the 12th century, Gervais of Tilbury noted: "In England we often \nsee men changed into wolves at the changes of the moon." 27 \n\nSacharow quoted an old Russian charm, to be spoken by one who \nwished to invoke the Moon-goddess and become a werewolf: \n\nOn the sea, on the ocean, on the island, on Bujan, on the empty pasture \ngleams the moon, on an ashstock lying in a green wood, in a gloomy \n\n\n\n1070 \n\n\n\nvale. Toward the stock wandereth a shaggy wolf, horned cattle seeking for Werewolf \n\nhis sharp white fangs; but the wolf enters not the forest, but the wolf \n\ndives not into the shadowy vale. Moon, moon, gold-horned moon, check ^^_^^^_^^^^^ \n\nthe flight of bullets, blunt the hunters\' knives, break the shepherds\' \n\ncudgels, cast wild fear upon all cattle, on men, on all creeping things, that \n\nthey may not catch the gray wolf, that they may not rend his warm \n\nskin! My word is binding, more binding than sleep, more binding than the \n\npromise of a hero. 28 \n\nThis charm has a ring of peasant magic, suggesting a hungry \npoacher hoping to steal some fresh meat from the baron\'s herds, under \nthe protection of a wolfskin. Poaching the overlord\'s cattle or game \nwas punishable by death, which may account for the cruelty meted out \nto those accused of lycanthropy. One captured "werewolf" in France \nwas so mauled that, a witness said, "he bore hardly any resemblance to a \nman, and struck with horror those who looked at him." The inquisi- \ntor, Pierre Boguet, explained that terrible injuries were common among \nwerewolves, due to the many lacerations they suffered while running \nthrough bramble bushes. 29 \n\nAnother werewolf captured by the Inquisition in 1 598 was "pos- \nsessed by a demon" while in prison, which gave him such a thirst that \nhe drank a large tubful of water, so his belly was "distended and hard." \nHe refused to eat or drink any more, and soon died. 30 Translating this \nofficial report into its probable reality, one would assume the unlucky \nwerewolf was subjected to the water torture and died of a ruptured \nstomach. \n\nAnother unfortunate werewolf was Peter Stubb of Cologne, tor- \ntured until he confessed having transformed himself into a wolf by a \nmagic girdle given him by the devil. The judges couldn\'t find the girdle \nwhere Stubb said he hid it, but they explained this by saying it had \n"gone to the Devil whence it came, so that it was not to be found." \nThough his case was unproved, Stubb was nastily executed for the \ncrime of lycanthropy: he was sentenced to have the flesh pulled off his \nbones in ten places with red-hot pincers, then to have his legs and \narms broken with a wooden axe; finally to be beheaded and burned. 31 \n\nYet another werewolf in 1 541 never even lasted long enough to go \nto prison. His captors hacked off his arms and legs, claiming to be \nsearching for the wolf-hair that he wore on the inside of his skin. The \nhair was not found, so the victim was declared innocent of lycan- \nthropy which did him little good, as he was already dead. 32 \n\nAn often-repeated story concerned a lone man attacked at night by \na lone wolf, which he wounded, usually by cutting off a forepaw. \nNext day a woman would be found with her hand missing, which \nidentified her as the werewolf. Such an incident was reported as fact \nby Jean de Nynauld in 161 5; the woman in the case was burned alive. 33 \nThe story probably recommended itself to some men as a perfect way \nto dispose of a woman they had mistreated, such as a rape victim. \n\nOn December 14, 1 598, a tailor of Chalons was sentenced to \n\n\n\n1071 \n\n\n\nWheel \n\n\n\ndeath for lycanthropy, having confessed to luring children into his \nshop, murdering and eating them. Methods by which these confessions \nwere extracted from the man can only be guessed, because the judges \nordered the court records burned. In 1 521 at Poligny, three men were \ninduced by torture to say they had made themselves wolves with a \nmagic salve given them by the devil, and in wolf shape they had eaten \nseveral children, and enjoyed sexual relations with wild she-wolves. 34 \nGilles Gamier was a famous "lycanthrope" caught by the Inquisition, \ntortured and executed for having devoured children. The charge was \nnot murder or cannibalism, but lycanthropy. 35 Whatever was left of the \npagan wolf cults, it seems the Christian church molded the material \ninto the enduring legend of the werewolf. \n\n1.

Tantric \ntradition showed the wheel as a mandala centering on the three \ntotems of the Triple Goddess, the dove (Virgin-Creatress), serpent \n(Mother-Preserver), and sow (Crone-Destroyer). 1 This mandala es- \ntablished "the six realms of the round of being," the sacred Hexagram. \n\nCelts worshipped the karmic star-wheel as the emblem of Mother \nArianrhod, ancestress of "Aryans." Some said it was a great silver \nwheel that dipped into the sea, on which heroes rode to Emania, the \nMoon\'s land of death. 2 \n\nIn Ethiopia the Goddess\'s image was placed in the center of a \nwheel of flames, like Indian images of Kali. Christian myths depict \nthe early missionaries\' destruction of her idol, which was called an old \nwoman with the power of the evil eye and with feet "like unto a \nwheel of fire." Jesus commanded: "Take this woman of the evil eye, \nand make up a fire, and carry her thereto, and throw her into it and \nburn her." 3 Her ashes were to be scattered to the wind, for people \nbelieved she might be resurrected from them, like the Phoenix, if \nthey remained in one place. \n\nDestruction of the Wheel-goddess\'s image was the probable basis \nfor the legend of St. Catherine, supposedly martyred on a wheel of \nfire, the famous "Catherine Wheel." There was no real St. Catherine, \n\n\n\n1072 \n\n\n\n\nbut there was a Goddess as Dancer of the Fiery Wheel, performing Wheel \n\nKathakali Kali\'s "dance of time" at the hub of the universe. The \n\nKalacakra Tantra (Wheel of Time), which presents this image, is still ^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe most revered text in India and Tibet, "coming at the head of the \n\ntannic section of the sacred canon." 4 See Catherine. \n\nCatherine was not the only medieval manifestation of the Goddess \nof the Wheel of Time, which was also the Wheel of Fortune \nmanipulated by the trinitarian Mother of Fate, Fortuna. In ancient \nRome she was one of the emanations of Juno Februata, whose \nfestival was Christianized as St. Valentine\'s Day. Its symbol was a wheel \nof six spokes formed of yonic mandorlas, in the Asiatic manner. 5 The \nsix spokes remained a sign of Juno well into the Christian era. 6 \n\nIn the 1 2th century, the Goddess and her wheel appeared in the \nHortus deliciarum (Garden of Delights). Wheel windows of cathe- \ndrals were connected with her, some showing human figures rising on \none side of the wheel and falling on the other, like the Rota Fortuna \nat the center of the Tarot\'s Major Trumps. "In these cathedral churches \nand royal abbeys is Dame Fortune who turns topsy-turvy faster than a \nwindmill." Honorius of Autun said, "Philosophers tell us of a woman Wheel of Fortune \n\nfastened to a wheel which turns perpetually, so that they say she is \nsometimes rising and sometimes falling with its movement. . . . The \nwoman fastened to the wheel is Fortune, whose head alternately rises \nand falls." Here was the real St. Catherine: the Fate-goddess, wor- \nshipped by builders who incorporated their own secret symbols into \nthe churches they built. Hugo pointed out that "Sometimes a porch, a \nfacade, or a whole church presents a symbolic meaning entirely \nforeign to worship, even inimical to the Church." 7 \n\nBoethius, a Gnostic philosopher whose writings were too popular \nto be ignored, was claimed as a Christian theologian; but his major \nwork made no mention of Christ. He found his Consolation of \nPhilosophy in the visitation of his guardian Goddesses, Philosophia \nand Fortuna. The latter taught him her doctrine of the karmic wheel: "I \ncause a rapid wheel to turn; I love to raise the fallen and abase the \nproud. Mount, then, if thou wilt, but on condition that thou dost not \nwax indignant when the law that presides at my Games demands that \nthou shalt descend." 8 \n\nFortuna, Goddess of the Wheel, may have been derived from a \npre-Roman Vortumna, "She Who Turns the Year." 9 Fate and \nTime were always linked in the thought of the ancients. Later Roman \nwriters tried to masculinize this Goddess as a seasonal god, Vertum- \nnus; but they gave away "his" original character by saying he appeared \nin the guise of an old woman. The Goddess was worshipped in both \nbeneficent and maleficent aspects as Bona Fortuna or Mala Fortuna, \nrepresented in her temple on the Esquiline as an All-Seeing Eye in \nthe form of a wheel. 10 \n\nAs Fortuna Primigeneia, the Goddess of the Wheel was called the \nfirstborn of the primal Mother Juno, and revered as the Virgin "who \n\n\n\n1073 \n\n\n\nWheel \n\n\n\nbestows on her worshippers every grace of body and every beauty of \nsoul." n She was identified with the Mazdean "Glory." From her, as \nthe Fortuna Augusti, Caesars drew their divine right to rule. \n\nHer fiery wheel was associated with kingship in a more primitive, \ndirect way during the early Bronze Age, when sacred kings died \nwithin the wheel of rebirth, as shown by the legend of Ixion, a ruler of \nthe Thessalian Lapiths. 12 Ixion was killed at the end of his term of \noffice, when he was rolled downhill, fastened inside a fiery wheel that \nsignified the sun. This sacred-king figure might be compared with the \nNorse deity Kris Kringle, a "Christ of the Wheel," personifying the \ndying and reborn sun of the winter solstice hence his later connec- \ntion with Christmas, even identification with Santa Claus. 13 \n\nNorthern Europeans believed the mystic wheels of existence \nstopped turning at the crucial transition from one year to the next, \nduring the darkest days of winter, when the sun came to its nadir. At this \ntime, during the season of Yule, all rotating motions were taboo. Cart \nwheels were not allowed to roll; butter could not be churned. 14 Yet at \nthe winter solstice and its corresponding point at the other side of the \nrolling year, Midsummer Eve, fiery fate-wheels were set rolling from \nBritish hilltops as late as the 19th century. "The Pagan rites of this \nfestival at the summer solstice, may be considered as a counterpart of \nthose used at the winter solstice at Yule-tide. . . . [T]he people imag- \nine that all their ill-luck rolls away from them together with this \nwheel." 15 \n\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 6th-century Christian mystic \nwho pretended to be a lst-century bishop of Athens and was believed \nauthentic for many centuries, declared that the class of angels called \nThrones were really Wheels, having the name of Gel, "which in the \nHebrew tongue signifies revolutions and revelations." 16 This image was \nOriental, drawn from the vision of eastern temples as gigantic world- \nchariots, complete with wheels, in which the god was enthroned. In his \nchariot the god participated in the Carnival of Existence, carrying the \nworld along with all its teeming life forms: animals, plants, mountains, \nrivers. Upon identification with the god, the sages said, "He who has \nseen his true self looks down upon transmigrating existence as upon a \nrolling chariot-wheel." 17 \n\nMedieval processions sometimes took a circular form and went \nround and round a public square or courtyard, this exhibition being \nknown as a carrousel, "a wheel of chariots." 18 The inclusion of its \nmodel in the proceedings of carnivals and fairs bears out the probabil- \nity of its pagan origin, for most of the traditional trappings of fairs were \nleft over from the Old Religion, including the wheel of Fortune. \n\nThe very name of the Carnival came from old festivals of the \nGoddess Carna, mother of "re-in-Carnations," the same cycles \ncontrolled by Kali\'s wheel of karma. The roulette or "little wheel" \nevolved from the eastern prayer wheel. Its spirit was not only Dame \nFortune, but also Lady Luck, from Sanskrit Loka, a Divine Midwife \n\n\n\n1074 \n\n\n\nguarding one of the planetary spheres or "ascending light planes of Whisper \n\nexperience." 19 Whistling \n\nAnother carnival manifestation of the wheel was the Ferris Wheel, ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\na form of the Fairies\' Wheel, descended from the Celtic Wheel of \n\nArianrhod. Riders of the Wheel represented pre-Christian "fairy folk" \n\nwhose souls were involved in karmic cycles. The Dream of King \n\nArthur describes a Fairies\' Wheel closely resembling the modern Ferris \n\nWheel. 20 \n\n1. Campbell, CM., 416. 2. Spence, 152-53. 3. Gifford, 57. 4. Tatz & Kent, 1 8. \n5.

Butler, 147. \n\n\n\nWhisper \n\nThe ancients believed that ghosts and spirits would speak in whispers. \nHaving been deprived of flesh, the dead spoke without laryngeal sound. \nNearly all supernatural beings were supposed to be identifiable by \ntheir whisper-voices, even God, according to 1 Kings 19:12 the "still \nsmall voice" of God speaking to Elijah was a mistranslation of a phase \nmeaning literally "a thin whisper." l \n\nOther biblical parallels are Job 4:16, the same word "whisper" \ntranslated as a still voice; and Isaiah 29:4: "Thy voice shall be as one \nthat hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall \nwhisper out of the dust." These passages indicate the practice of \nancient "spirit mediums" when purporting to be in communication \nwith the dead. Impersonating the spirit, they whispered, so the voice \ncouldn\'t be identified. \n\nIn a medieval German legend, the Triple Goddess presided over a \nland of the dead called Wisperthal (Valley of Whispers) centering on \nan enchanted Hall of Mirrors perhaps related to the fairy-tale Crystal \nMountain. Three innocent youths once trespassed in the valley, met \nvarious aspects of the Goddess as three beautiful maidens, three terrible \nhags, and three black death-ravens. They barely escaped with their \nlives from the eerie place and vowed never to return. 2 \n\n1. Hoolce, S.P., 57. 2. Guerber, L.R., 219. \n\n\n\nWhistling \n\nAn old rhyme says "Whistling girls and crowing hens never come to \nany good ends." It was true; women who whistled were suspected of \nwitchcraft. Whistling was a piece of sympathetic magic used to raise a \nwind. Becalmed sailors were allowed to "whistle for the wind," but \nwhistling women were believed to cause destructive storms. 1 There- \nfore it became "unladylike" for girls to whistle. \n\nl.Robbins,361. \n\n\n\n1075 \n\n\n\nWiddershins \nWitch \n\n\n\nvar. Withershins \n\n\n\nWiddershins \n\nCounterclockwise, the direction of the moon, or "left-hand path" of \npagan dances (still prevalent in folk tradition). To open the door of a \nfairy hill, one must walk around it three times widdershins, as Childe \nRowland did, calling, "Open door!" The same Open Sesame appears in \nother ballads: "Thrice went fair Agnes the mountain round, and \nentered the cave beneath the ground." l As sacred caves once served as \npagan temples, the medieval church forbade their use and claimed \nthat walking or turning one\'s self widdershins was an indicium of \nwitchcraft. 2 See Left Hand. \n\n1. Wimberly, 363, 367. 2. Robbins, 209, 421 . \n\n\n\nWillow \n\nWater and willows represented the Goddess Helice, "Willow," virgin \nform of Hecate with her willow-withe grain-basket. 1 Willow wands \ninvoked the Muses, whose mountain was encircled by the Helicon, \n"Willow-stream." The Dionysian thyrsus, like the later witch\'s wand, \nwas willow. As Dionysus was once a major god of Jerusalem, the \nwillow figured prominently in municipal ceremonies there. A "Great \nDay" of the Feast of Tabernacles was known as the Day of Willows, \nwith rites honoring fire and water. 2 Willow wands gave protection in the \nunderworld, where Orpheus carried one to show the way. 3 Willow \nwands were sacred to the Moon-goddess as late as the 1 7th century a.d., \nwhen an English herbal said the moon owns the willow. \n\nWitches used willow bark to treat rheumatism and fevers; it was \nthe source of salicylic acid (aspirin), one of Hecate\'s cures. Some said \nwicca or "witchcraft" evolved from a word meaning willow, cognate \nwith "wicker" (willow-withe weaving). Magic cats were supposed to \ngrow from pussy-willows or "catkins," to become witches\' malkins \n(familiars): hence the saying that all cats were gray in the beginning. \nThe catkins were harbingers of spring, appearing on the willow as \ngraymalkins. (See Cat.) \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,115. 2. Graves, W.G., 47. 3. Pepper & Wilcock, 57. \n\n\n\nWitch \n\nThere were many other words for witches, such as Incantatrix, \nLamia, Saga, Maga, Malefica, Sortilega, Strix, Venefica. 3 In Italy a \nwitch was a Strega or Janara, an old title of a priestess of Jana (Juno). 4 \nEnglish writers called witches both "hags" and "fairies," words which \nwere once synonymous. 5 Witches had metaphoric titles: bacularia, \n"stick-rider"; fascinatrix, "one with the evil eye"; herberia, "one who \ngathers herbs"; strix, "screech-owl"; pixidria, "keeper of an ointment- \n\n\n\n1076 \n\n\n\nbox"; femina saga, "wise- woman"; lamia, "night-monster"; incantator, \n"worker of charms"; magus, "wise-man"; sortiariae mulier, "seeress"; \nveneficia, "poisoner"; maliarda, "evil-doer." Latin treatises called witch- \nes anispex, auguris, divinator, januatica, ligator, mascara, phitonissa, \nstregula. 6 \n\nDalmatian witches were krstaca, "crossed ones," a derivative of the \nGreek Christos. 1 In Holland a witch was wijsseggher, "wise-sayer," \nfrom which came the English "wiseacre." 8 The biblical passage that \nsupported centuries of persecution, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to \nlive" (Exodus 22:18), used the Hebrew word kasaph, translated "witch" \nalthough it means a seer or diviner. 9 \n\nEarly medieval England had female clan-leaders who exercised \nmatriarchal rights in lawgiving and law enforcement; the Magna \nCarta of Chester called them iudices de wich judges who were \nwitches. 10 Female elders once had political power among the clans, \nbut patriarchal religion and law gradually took it away from them and \ncalled them witches in order to dispose of them. In 1711 Addison \nobserved that "When an old woman begins to doat and grow chargeable \nto a Parish, she is generally turned into a witch." u \n\nScot remarked that the fate of a witch might be directly proportion- \nal to her fortune. The pope made saints out of rich witches, but poor \nwitches were burned. 12 Among many examples tending to support this \nopinion was the famous French Chambre Ardente affair, which \ninvolved many members of the aristocracy and the upper-class clergy in \na witch cult. Numerous male and female servants were tortured and \nburned for assisting their masters in working witchcraft; but in all the \nfour years the affair dragged on, no noble person was tortured or \nexecuted. 13 \n\nIllogically enough, the authorities persecuted poor, outcast folk as \nwitches, yet professed to believe witches could provide themselves \nwith all the wealth anyone could want. Reginald Scot, a disbeliever, \nscornfully observed that witches were said to "transfer their neigh- \nbors\' corn into their own ground, and yet are perpetual beggars, and \ncannot enrich themselves, either with money or otherwise: who is so \nfoolish as to remain longer in doubt of their supernatural powers? " H \nWitchcraft brought so little profit to Helen Jenkenson of Northants, \nhanged in 1612 for bewitching a child, that the record of her execution \nsaid: "Thus ended this woman her miserable life, after she had lived \nmany years poor, wretched, scorned and forsaken of the world." 15 \n\nThe nursery-rhyme stereotype of the witch owed much to Scot\'s \ndescription: \n\nWomen which be commonly old, lame, blear-eyed, pale, foul, and full of \nwrinkles; poor, sullen, superstitious, and papists; or such as know no \nreligion; in whose drowsy minds the devil hath gotten a fine seat; so as, \nwhat mischief, mischance, calamity, or slaughter is brought to pass, \nthey are easily persuaded the same is done by themselves. . . . They are \n\n\n\nWitch \n\n\n\nSkeat\'s Etymological \nDictionary derived \n"witch" from medi- \neval English wicche, \nformerly Anglo-Sax- \non wicca, masculine, or \nwicce, feminine: a \ncorruption of witga, \nshort form of witega, \na seer or diviner; from \nAnglo-Saxon witan, \nto see, to know. Similar- \nly, Icelandic vitki, a \nwitch, came from vita, \nto know; or vizkr, \nclever or knowing one. \nWizard came from \nNorman French wis- \nchard, Old French \nguiscart, sagacious one. 1 \nThe surname Whit- \ntaker came from \nWitakarlege, a wiz- \nard or a witch. 2 The \nwords "wit" and \n"wisdom" came from \nthe same roots. \n\n\n\n1077 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHcti \n\n\n\nlean and deformed, showing melancholy in their faces, to the horror of \nall that see them. They are doting, scolds, mad, devilish; and not much \ndiffering from them that are thought to be possessed with spirits. \' 6 \n\nPersecutors said it was heretical to consider witches harmless. \nEven in England, where witches were not burned but hanged, some \nauthorities fearfully cited the "received opinion" that a witch\'s body \nshould be burned to ashes to prevent ill effects arising from her blood. 1 \' \nChurchmen assured the arresting officers that a witch\'s power was \nlost the instant she was touched by an employee of the Inquisition; but \nthe employees themselves were not so sure. 18 \n\nNumerous stories depict the persecutors\' fear of their victims. It \nwas said in the Black Forest that a witch blew in her executioner\'s \nface, promising him his reward; the next day he was afflicted with a fate \nleprosy. Inquisitors\' handbooks directed them to wear at all times a \nbag of salt consecrated on Palm Sunday; to avoid looking in a witch\'s \neyes; and to cross themselves constantly in the witches\' prison. Peter \nof Berne forgot this precaution, and a captive witch by enchantment \nmade him fall down a flight of stairs which he proved later by \ntorturing her until she confirmed it. 19 \n\nAny unusual ability in a woman instantly raised a charge of \nwitchcraft. The so-called Witch of Newbury was murdered by a \ngroup of soldiers because she knew how to go "surfing" on the river. \nSoldiers of the Earl of Essex saw her doing it, and were "as much \nastonished as they could be," seeing that "to and fro she fleeted on the \nboard standing firm bolt upright . . . turning and winding it which \nway she pleased, making it pastime to her, as little thinking who \nperceived her tricks, or that she did imagine that they were the last \nshe ever should show." Most of the soldiers were afraid to touch her, \nbut a few brave souls ambushed the board-rider as she came to shore, \nslashed her head, beat her, and shot her, leaving her "detested carcass fo \nthe worms." 20 \n\nFrom ruthlessly organized persecutions on the continent, witch- \nhunts in England became largely cases of village feuds and petty \nspite. If crops failed, horses ran away, cattle sickened, wagons broke, \nwomen miscarried, or butter wouldn\'t come in the churn, a witch \nwas always found to blame. Marion Cumlaquoy of Orkney was burned \nin 1643 for turning herself three times widdershins, to make her \nneighbor\'s barley crop rot. A tailor\'s wife was executed for quarrelling \nwith her neighbor, who afterward saw a snake on his property, and his \nchildren fell sick. One witch was condemned for arguing with a \ndrunkard in an alehouse. After drinking himself into paroxysms of \nvomiting, he accused her of bewitching him, and he was believed. 21 \n\nA woman was convicted of witchcraft for having caused a neigh- \nbor\'s lameness by pulling off her stockings. Another was executed \nfor having admired a neighbor\'s baby, which afterward fell out of its \ncradle and died. Two Glasgow witches were hanged for treating a \nsick child, even though the treatment succeeded and the child was \n\n\n\n1078 \n\n\n\ncured. Joan Cason of Kent went to the gallows in 1 586 for having dry \nthatch on her roof. Her neighbor, whose child was sick, was told by an \nunidentified traveler that the child was bewitched, and it could be \nproved by stealing a bit of thatch from the witch\'s roof and throwing it \non the fire. If it crackled and sparked, witchcraft was assured. The test \ncame out positive, and the court was satisfied enough to convict poor \nJoan. 22 \n\nWitches were convenient scapegoats for doctors who failed to cure \ntheir patients, for it was the "received" belief that witch-caused \nillnesses were incurable. Weyer said, "Ignorant and clumsy physicians \nblame all sicknesses which they are unable to cure or which they have \ntreated wrongly, on witchery." There were also priests and monks who \n"claim to understand the healing art and they lie to those who seek \nhelp that their sicknesses are derived from witchery." 23 Most real witch \npersecutions reflect "no erotic orgies, no Sabbats or elaborate rituals; \nmerely the hatreds and spites of narrow peasant life assisted by vicious \nlaws." 24 \n\nWitches provided a focus for sexist hatred in male-dominated \nsociety, as Stanton pointed out: \n\nThe spirit of the Church in its contempt for women, as shown in the \nScriptures, in Paul\'s epistles and the Pentateuch, the hatred of the \nfathers, manifested in their ecclesiastical canons, and in the doctrines of \nasceticism, celibacy, and witchcraft, destroyed man \'s respect for woman \nand legalized the burning, drowning, and torturing of women. . . . \n\nWomen and their duties became objects of hatred to the Christian \nmissionaries and of alternate scorn and fear to pious ascetics and \nmonks. The priestess mother became something impure, associated with \nthe devil, and her lore an infernal incantation, her very cooking a \nbrewing of poison, nay, her very existence a source of sin to man. Thus \nwoman, as mother and priestess, became woman as witch. . . . \n\nHere is the reason why in all the Biblical researches and higher \ncriticism, the scholars never touch the position of women. 25 \n\nMen displayed a lively interest in the physical appearance of \nwitches, seeking to know how to recognize them as men also craved \nrules for recognizing other types of women from their physical \nappearance. It was generally agreed that any woman with dissimilar eyes \nwas a witch. Where most people had dark eyes and swarthy complex- \nions, as in Spain and Italy, pale blue eyes were associated with \nwitchcraft. Many claimed any woman with red hair was a witch. 26 \n\nThis may have been because red-haired people are usually freck- \nled, and freckles were often identified as "witch marks," as were \nmoles, warts, birthmarks, pimples, pockmarks, cysts, liver spots, wens, or \nany other blemish. Some witch-finders said the mark could resemble \nan insect bite or an ulcer. 27 \n\nNo one ever explained how the witch mark differed from an \nordinary blemish. Since few bodies were unblemished, the search for \nthe mark seldom failed. Thomas Ady recognized this, and wrote: "Very \n\n\n\nWitch \n\n\n\nThomas Ady One \n\nof the few 17th-century \nEnglish debunkers of \nthe witchcraft craze; au- \nthor of A Perfect \nDiscovery of Witches \n(1661). \n\n\n\n1079 \n\n\n\nWitch \n\n\n\nDean R.W. \nChurch British clergy- \nman, author of St. \nAnselm (1870). \n\n\n\nfew people in the world are without privy marks upon their bodies, as \nmoles or stains, even such as witchmongers call the devil\'s privy \nmarks." 28 But no one paid attention to this. \n\nTrials were conducted with as much injustice as possible. In 1629 \nIsobel Young was accused of crippling by magic a man who had \nquarrelled with her, and causing a water mill to break down. She \nprotested that the man was lame before their quarrel, and water mills \ncan break down through neglect. The prosecutor, Sir Thomas Hope, \nthrew out her defense on the ground that it was "contrary to the \nlibel," that is, it contradicted the charge. 29 When a witch is on trial, Scot \nsaid, any "equivocal or doubtful answer is taken for a confession." 30 \n\nOn the other hand, no answer at all was a confession too. \nWitches who refused to speak were condemned: "Witchcraft proved by \nsilence of the accused." 31 Sometimes mere playfulness "proved" \nwitchcraft, as in the case of Mary Spencer, accused in 1634 because she \nmerrily set her bucket rolling downhill and ran before it, calling it to \nfollow her. 32 Sometimes women were stigmatized as witches when they \nwere in fact victims of unfair laws, such as the law that accepted any \nman\'s word in court ahead of any number of women\'s. A butcher in \nGermany stole some silver vessels from women, then had them \nprosecuted for witchcraft by claiming that he found the vessels in the \nwoods where the women were attending a witches\' sabbat. 33 \n\nSometimes the accusation of witchcraft was a form of punishment \nfor women who were too vocal about their disillusionment with men \nand their preference for living alone. Historical literature has many \nreferences to "the joy with which women after widowhood set up \ntheir own households, and to the vigor with which they resisted being \ncourted by amorous widowers." 34 The solitary life, however, left a \nwoman even more vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft, since men \nusually thought she must be somehow controlled. \n\nThose who tortured the unfortunate defendant into admitting \nwitchcraft used a euphemistic language that showed the victim was \ncondemned a priori. One Anne Marie de Georgel denied making a \ndevil\'s pact, until by torture she was "justly forced to give an account \nof herself," the record said. Catherine Delort was "forced to confess by \nthe means we have power to use to make people speak the truth," \nand she was "convicted of all the crimes we suspected her of commit- \nting, although she protested her innocence for a long time." The \ninquisitor Nicholas Remy professed a pious astonishment at the great \nnumber of witches who expressed a "positive desire for death," \npretending not to notice that they had been brought to this desire by \ninnumerable savage tortures. 35 See Torture. \n\nThe extent to which pagan religion, as such, actually survived \namong the witches of the 16th and 17th centuries has been much \ndiscussed but never decided. Dean Church said, "Society was a long \ntime unlearning heathenism; it has not done so yet; but it had hardly \nbegun, at any rate it was only just beginning, to imagine the possibility \n\n\n\n1080 \n\n\n\nof such a thing in the eleventh century." In 1 5th-century Bohemia it Witchcraft \n\nwas still common practice at Christmas and other holidays to make \n\nofferings to "the gods," rather than to God. 35 European villages still ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhad many "wise-women" who acted as priestesses officially or unoffi- \ncially. Since church fathers declared Christian priestesses \nunthinkable, all functions of the priestess were associated with pagan- \nism. 37 Bishops described pagan gatherings in their dioceses, attended \nby "devils ... in the form of men and women." 38 Pagan ceremonies \nwere allowed to survive in weddings, folk festivals, seasonal rites, \nfeasts of the dead, and so on. 39 But when women or Goddesses played \nthe leading role in such ceremonies, there was more determined \nsuppression. John of Salisbury wrote that it was the devil, "with God\'s \npermission," who sent people to gatherings in honor of the Queen of \nthe Night, a priestess impersonating the Moon-goddess under the name \nof Noctiluca or Herodiade. 40 \n\nThe Catholic church applied the word "witch" to any woman who \ncriticized church policies. Women allied with the 14th-century \nReforming Franciscans, some of whom were burned for heresy, were \ndescribed as witches, daughters of Judas, and instigated of the Devil. 41 \nWriters of the Talmud similarly tended to view nearly all women as \nwitches. They said things like, "Women are naturally inclined to \nwitchcraft," and "The more women there are, the more witchcraft \nthere will be." 42 \n\nProbably there were few sincere practitioners, compared with the \n\nmultitudes who were railroaded into the ecclesiastical courts and \n\nlegally murdered despite their innocence. Yet it was obvious to even the \n\nmoderately intelligent that Christian society deliberately humiliated \n\nand discriminated against women. Some may have been resentful \n\nenough to become defiant. "Women have had no voice in the canon \n\nlaw, the catechisms, the church creeds and discipline, and why should \n\nthey obey the behests of a strictly masculine religion, that places the \n\nsex at a disadvantage in all life\'s emergencies?" 43 Possibilities for \n\nexpressing their frustration and defiance were severely limited; but \n\nvoluntary adoption of the witch\'s reputation and behavior was surely \n\namong such possibilities. \n\nl.Leland,66. 2.

Martin of Braga said women must be \n^^^^^^^^^ condemned for "decorating tables, wearing laurels, taking omens \n^^^^^^^"" from footsteps, putting fruit and wine on the log in the hearth, and \nbread in the well, what are these but worship of the devil? For \nwomen to call upon Minerva when they spin, and to observe the day of \nVenus at weddings and to call upon her whenever they go out upon \nthe public highway, what is that but worship of the devil?" l \n\nOutside the official religion, where they were kept, women passed \ndown their private family recipes and charms, curses and blessings, \ntelling traditional tales of the past and foretelling the future from omens \nand "signs." The Dominican Johann Herolt declared: "Most women \nbelie their catholic faith with charms and spells, after the fashion of Eve \ntheir first mother, who believed the devil speaking through the \nserpent rather than God himself. . . . [A]ny woman by herself knows \nmore of such superstitions and charms than a hundred men." 2 \n\nUp to the 1 5th century, women\'s "charms and spells" were \nvirtually the only repository of practical medicine. Churchmen avoid- \ned doctoring, on the ground that all sickness came from demonic \npossession, and the only permissible cure was exorcism. 3 \n\nEurope\'s traditional witch doctors were women: clan mothers, \npriestesses of healing shrines, midwives, nurses, vilas. In pre-Christian \nGaul and Scandinavia, medicine was entirely in the hands of women. 4 \nEven in the Christian era, the village wise-woman was still every \npeasant\'s family doctor. Paracelsus said witches taught him everything \nhe knew about healing. 5 Dr. Lambe, the Duke of Buckingham\'s \nfamous "devil," was said to have learned secrets of medicine by \nconsorting with witches. 6 \n\nIn 1 570 the gaoler of Canterbury Castle released a condemned \nwitch, citing the popular opinion that she did more good for the sick \nwith her homely remedies than all the priests\' prayers and exorcisms. 7 \nAgrippa von Nettesheim thought witches superior to male practitio- \nners: "Are not philosophers, mathematicians, and astrologers often \ninferior to country women in their divinations and predictions, and \ndoes not the old nurse very often beat the doctor?" 8 The men who \nlearned doctoring from witches were allowed to practice, but their \nfemale teachers were persecuted. Scot observed that a male "conjurer" \nwas permitted to cure disease by magic arts, whereas a woman was \ncondemned to death for doing so. 9 \n\nOrdinary folk had no doctors. Physicians were available chiefly to \nthe rich. The poor took their troubles to the local witch. Irish farmers \nstill say a "fairy doctor" is needed for charms against the evil eye. In \nGreece, "both priests and witches are available for emergencies \ncreated by the evil eye. The priest burns incense and recites appropriate \nprayers. The witch also burns incense as she recites appropriate \nincantations." 10 \n\nIt wasn\'t unusual for the witches\' healing charms to be preferred \n\n\n\n1082 \n\n\n\nto those of the church, or for the two to be regarded as identical in Witchcraft \n\nessence. Ramesey wrote that the witches\' cures were indistinguish- \nable from the "magical and juggling cures" professed by the clergy, ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nincluding "saints, images, relics, holy-waters, shrines, avemarys, cru- \ncifixes, benedictions, charms, characters, sigils of the planets, and of the \nsigns ... all such cures are rather to be ascribed to the forces of the \nimagination, than any virtue in them." n \n\nOfficially, women were often forbidden to do any kind of healing. \nIn 1322 a woman named Jacoba Felicie was arrested and prosecuted \nby the medical faculty of the University of Paris for practicing medicine, \nalthough, the record said, "she was wiser in the art of surgery and \nmedicine than the greatest master or doctor in Paris." 12 \n\nScot said witchmongers gave the witches as much power as Christ, \nand even more, when they claimed witches could raise the dead, as \nChrist raised Lazarus; they could turn water into other fluids, like wine \nor milk; they could control the weather, the crops, animals, men; they \ncould see into the past and future. Reading of witches\' trials, he said, \n"you shall see such impossibilities confessed, as none, having his right \nwits, will believe." n Loher also declared that the "sins" for which \nwitches were brought to the stake were such "that they could not \npossibly commit." 14 \n\nChurchmen, however, viewed the impossibility of witches\' mir- \nacles as perfectly good ground for believing them, "because the \nperformance of the impossible proved that demons were at work." 15 It \nwas never explained how the performance of a miracle demonstrated \nthe intervention of a saint in one case and of a demon in another. For \nexample, Marie Bucaille was burned as a witch, though her "mir- \nacles" were saintlike: she healed the sick, saw holy visions, displayed \nstigmata, and performed many of the acts that led to canonization in \nother cases. 16 \n\nThe same acts were differently interpreted by churchmen in \ndifferent times. Witchcraft was allowed through the first half of the \nChristian era. It was not called a "heresy" until the 14th century. In 500 \na.d. the Franks\' Salic Law recognized witches\' right to practice. In \n643, an edict declared it illegal to burn witches. 17 In 785, the Synod of \nPaderborn said anyone who burned a witch must be sentenced to \ndeath. 18 France\'s first trial to declare witchcraft a crime took place in \n1390. 19 \n\nUp to a surprisingly late date, nobility and clergy alike employed \nthe services of witches. In 1382 the Count of Kyburg hired a witch to \nstand on the battlements of his castle and raise a thunderstorm to \ndisperse an army of enemies. 20 This practice was soundly based on \ntheological opinion that witches could raise storms at will, "either upon \nsea or land." 21 Churchmen said witches controlled the weather "with \nGod\'s permission," and they didn\'t begin to punish what God permitted \nuntil the beginning of the Renaissance. 22 \n\nWitches were summoned to court by Louis d\'Orleans to cure his \n\n\n\n1083 \n\n\n\nWitchcraft \n\n\n\nbrother\'s madness, after priestly exorcisms had failed. (The witches \nalso failed.) Guichard, Bishop of Troyes, used the classic pierced-puppet \nkind of witchcraft to kill his enemy, Queen Blanche of Navarre. 23 \n\nEnglish law was fairly tolerant of witchcraft until the reign of \nJames I. As late as 1371 a male witch was arrested in Southwark for \npossessing magical articles: a skull, a grimoire, and a corpse\'s head for \ndivination. He was released after he had promised not to do it again. 24 \nIn 1 560, a lenient period, eight men confessed to conjuration and \nsorcery, and were released with a reprimand. Only three years later the \nsame acts were made punishable by imprisonment or a death penalty. 25 \n\nThe Council of Treves in 1 3 10 outlawed conjurations, divina- \ntions, and love potions. 26 Further prohibitions seemed to be aimed at \nsupporting husbands who wished to cast off their wives. Stringent laws \nthreatened a witch to whom an abandoned wife might apply, for \nrevenge through malefica, since she had no recourse under law. 27 \n\nThe church distinguished between sorcery, which was generally \nacceptable, and witchcraft, which was heresy. Von Nettesheim\'s books \nof sorcery were published under church auspices, accompanied by a \nstatement of ecclesiastical approval; indeed, his instructor in magic had \nbeen John Trithemius, an abbot. What the distinction between sorcery \nand witchcraft boiled down to was that men could practice magic, \nwomen could not. 28 \n\nWhen the church discovered that common folk couldn\'t under- \nstand the doctrinal subtleties of heresy and didn\'t care about theological \narguments, persecution was extended into areas that were accessible to \nthe public mind, so the church could maintain its control of that mind. \nFor example, in the region of Bonn a late spring frost of 1610 ruined \ncrops and was officially described as an act of God. Twenty years later, \nafter the witch judges came to the area, the same kind of natural \ndisasters were blamed exclusively on witches. 29 \n\nChurchmen fostered the public delusion that witches were en- \ngaged in a vast secret plot, under the devil\'s guidance, to overthrow the \nkingdom of God on earth. They created and embellished the concept of \nthe black mass, and made laymen believe it frequently occurred, \nwhereas it was largely a fraud supported only by spurious "evidence" \nfrom the torture chamber. The Inquisition needed this public delusion, \nbecause the work it was created for was finished when the Albigensian, \nWaldensian, and other heretic groups of the south of France had been \nfinally crushed. In order to continue its profitable existence, the Inquisi- \ntion needed new victims. The witchcraft mania was the solution to its \nproblem. 50 Whatever secular crimes the witches were supposed to have \ncommitted, the one crime that was decisive in sending all of them to the \nstake was the one crime of which all of them were completely innocent, \nbecause it was impossible: the crime of collaborating with a real devil. \nAs for secret continuation of a pre-Christian religion: that was more \noften done by the church itself, in the guise of saint-worship, festivals, \nhealing shrines, etc. \n\n\n\n1084 \n\n\n\nScholars aren\'t sure how much pagan religion survived in the form \nof actual group worship, at the beginning of the era of persecution. Pico \ndella Mirandola\'s La Strega (The Witch) described a cult in northern \nItaly where a pagan Goddess presided over sexual orgies; she was said to \nbear a close resemblance to the Mother of God. 31 Another group at \nArras was said to have centered on "a prostitute" called Demiselle, or \nThe Maiden. Her consort was the Abbot of Little Sense, otherwise \nknown as the Prince of Fools, a composer and singer of popular \nsongs in other words, it was a cult of minstrelsy. 52 (See Romance.) \n\nThere is a vast body of "information" about what went on at the \nwitches\' Sabbat all of it worthless, because its source was the torture \nchamber. The late Renaissance saw a frivolous interest in "black \nmasses" among the wealthy, who tried to model a new cult group on \nwhat they had read of earlier trials. In 1610, Pierre de l\'Ancre wrote of \n"great Lords and Ladies and other rich and powerful ones who handle \nthe great matters of the Sabbath, where they appear cloaked, and the \nwomen with masks, that they may keep themselves always hidden and \nunknown." 33 In the reign of Louis XIV, half the Parisian clergy and \nmost of the court, including Madame de Montespan, were involved \nwith a society witch called La Voisin, who staged black masses for \nthem. 34 But their rituals were based on ecclesiastical literature, not on a \ntrue folk tradition. \n\nIt has been claimed that witchcraft constituted a coherent under- \nground organization from the beginning, with well-defined chains of \ncommand and communication. "Witch books" purporting to come \nfrom the ancient tradition speak of a Brotherhood (not Sisterhood): "If \nyou are condemned, fear not, the Brotherhood is powerful, they will \nhelp you to escape if you stand steadfast. ... Be sure, if steadfast you go \nto the pyre, drugs will reach you, you will feel naught. You but go to \ndeath and what lies beyond, the Ecstasy of the Goddess." 35 But during \nthe real persecutions, few witches seemed indifferent to their sufferings, \nand virtually none escaped. \n\nMonstrelet described a typical early example of persecution in \n1459. \n\nIn this year, in the town of Arras and county of Artois, arose, through a \nterrible and melancholy chance, an opinion called, I know not why, the \nReligion of Vaudoisie. This sect consisted, it is said, of certain persons, \nboth men and women, who, under cloud of night, by the power of the \ndevil, repaired to some solitary spot, amid woods and deserts, where the \ndevil appeared before them in a human form save that his visage is \nnever perfectly visible to them read to the assembly a book of his \nordinances, informing them how he could be obeyed; distributed a very \nlittle money and a plentiful meal, which was concluded by a scene of \ngeneral profligacy; after which each one of the party was conveyed home \nto her or his own habitation. \n\nOn accusations of access to such acts of madness, several creditable \npersons of the town of Arras were seized and imprisoned along with some \nfoolish women and persons of little consequence. These were so horribly \n\n\n\nWitchcraft \n\n\n\nFrancoise Athenais \nde Rochechouart, \n\nMarquise de Mon- \ntespan (1641-1707). \nMistress of Louis \nXIV for 1 3 years, moth- \ner of seven of his \nchildren; court patron- \ness of Corneille, \nRacine, and La \nFontaine. \n\n\n\n1085 \n\n\n\nWitchcraft \n\n\n\ntortured that some of them admitted the truth of the whole accusations, \nand said, besides, that they had seen and recognized in their nocturnal \nassembly many persons of rank, prelates, seigneurs, and governors of \nbailliages and cities, being such names as the examiners had suggested to \nthe persons examined, while they constrained them by torture to impeach \nthe persons to whom they belonged. Several of those who had been thus \ninformed against were arrested, thrown into prison, and tortured for so \nlong a time that they also were obliged to confess what was charged \nagainst them. After this those of mean condition were executed and \ninhumanly burnt, while the richer and more powerful of the accused \nransomed themselves by sums of money, to avoid the punishment and the \nshame attending it. Many even of those also confessed being persuaded to \ntake that course by the interrogators, who promised them indemnity for \nlife and fortune. Some there were, of a truth, who suffered with marvel- \nlous patience and constancy the torments inflicted on them, and would \nconfess nothing imputed to their charge; but they, too, had to give large \nsums to the judges, who exacted that such of them as, notwithstanding \ntheir mishandling, were still able to move, should banish themselves from \nthat part of the country. . . . fl]t ought not to be concealed that the whole \naccusation was a strategem of wicked men for their own covetous \npurposes, and in order, by these false accusations and forced confessions, \nto destroy the life, fame, and fortune of wealthy persons. * 6 \n\nThose prisoners who found themselves condemned to death \nimmediately shrieked aloud that they had been tricked; they were \npromised a light sentence, such as a pilgrimage, if they confessed as \nthe inquisitors wanted. 57 \n\nWitchcraft persecutions picked up momentum when inquisitors \nwere seeking new victims to keep their organization going. In 1375 a \nFrench inquisitor lamented that all the rich heretics had been extermi- \nnated; there were none left whose wealth could support the \nInquisition, and "it is a pity that so salutary an institution as ours should \nbe so uncertain of its future." Then Pope John XXII empowered the \nInquisition to prosecute anyone who worked magic, and "the Inquisi- \ntion slowly and unevenly developed its concept of witchcraft." w \nSoon the church was making sweeping claims, such as the claim that the \nentire population of Navarre consisted of witches. 59 \n\nWitch hunting sustained itself because it became a major industry, \nsupporting the income of many. Local nobles, bishops, kings, judges, \ncourts, townships, magistrates, and other functionaries high and low all \nreceived a share of the loot collected by inquisitors from their victims\' \nassets. Victims were charged for the very ropes that bound them and the \nwood that burned them. Each procedure of torture carried its fee. \nAfter the execution of a wealthy witch, officials usually treated them- \nselves to a banquet at the expense of the victim\'s estate. 40 \n\nInquisitors were no less zealous in wringing the last penny out of \ntheir poorer victims than in helping themselves to the estates of the \nrich. In 1256, a woman named Raymonde Barbaira died before her \nsentence could be carried out, leaving to her heirs a chest of linens, \n\n\n\n1086 \n\n\n\nher clothes, several cows, and four sous in cash. The inquisitor demand- Witchcraft \n\ned from the heirs forty sous for all the property. "Such petty and \n\nvulgar details," Lea said, "give us a clearer insight into the spirit and ^ ^^ m mmmmm \n\nworking of the Inquisition, and of the grinding oppression which it \n\nexercised on the subject populations." 41 \n\nA history of the Inquisition written by a Catholic in 1909 had to \nadmit that it "invented the crime of witchcraft and . . . relied on torture \nas the means of proving it." At first the Inquisition encountered \nskepticism everywhere. Even theologians shocked the inquisitors by \nattributing natural disasters to chance, or God, rather than to witch- \ncraft. The public disbelieved witches\' confessions, saying they were \nextracted only by torture. Peasants in some subalpine valleys broke \ninto open rebellion against the judges\' wholesale burnings. It took \ndecades of ceaseless propagandizing, and ruthless measures to stop \nthe mouths of critics, before the persecution could be said to have won \npublic support. 42 \n\nSevere persecution dated from the bull of Pope Innocent VIII, \nSummis desiderantes, wherein God\'s vicar "infallibly" declared that \nwitches could blast crops and domestic animals, cause disease, prevent \nhusbands and wives from copulating, and in general "outrage the \nDivine Majesty and are a cause of scandal and danger to very many." 43 \nThe Divine Majesty being apparently unable to look after its own \ninterests without human help, the churchmen took it upon themselves \nto carry out God\'s vengeance, which developed into a "hideous \nnightmare" as the church\'s mailed fist stretched over the western world \nfor five centuries. 44 \n\nThe earlier Canon Episcopi ruled that witchcraft was nothing but \na delusion, and it was heresy to believe in it. But that was before the \nchurch discovered how to profit from the witchcraft belief. After Pope \nInnocent\'s reign, it was heresy not to believe in witchcraft. According \nto Martin Del Rio, S.J., anyone who thought witchcraft was only a \ndeception must be suspected of being a witch. No one was allowed to \nspeak against the extermination of witches. Inquisitor Heinrich von \nSchultheis said, "He who opposes the extermination of the witches \nwith one single word can not expect to remain unscathed." 45 \n\nSuperstitious belief in the "evil" of witchcraft persisted to a very \nlate date. The last English witch trial took place in 1712. The last \nofficial witch burning in Scotland was in 1727, with unofficial incidents \neven later. Only a century ago, an elderly woman in the Russian \nvillage of Wratschewe was locked in her cottage and set afire for \nbewitching cattle. Her murderers were tried, and sentenced only to a \nlight ecclesiastical penance. 46 In January, 1928, a family of Hungarian \npeasants beat an old woman to death, claiming she was a witch. A \ncourt acquitted them, on the ground that they acted out of "irresistible \ncompulsion." 47 \n\nThe real reason for persistence of the witchcraft idea was that \nChristian authorities couldn\'t let it die, without admitting that God\'s \n\n\n\n1087 \n\n\n\nWitchcraft \n\n\n\nword was wrong, and God\'s servants had committed millions of legal \nmurders and tortured millions of helpless people without cause. Dr. \nBlackstone, England\'s ultimate authority on jurisprudence, wrote: "To \ndeny the possibility, nay, actual existence of Witchcraft and Sorcery, \nis at once flatly to contradict the revealed Word of God in various \npassages both of the Old and New Testament; and the thing itself is a \ntruth to which every Nation in the World hath in its turn borne \ntestimony." When skepticism about witchcraft seemed to be on the \nrise, John Wesley cried bitterly, "The giving up of witchcraft is in effect \nthe giving up of the Bible." 48 Calvin and Knox also protested that \ndenial of witchcraft meant denial of the Bible\'s authority. 49 Joseph \nGlanvill, chaplain to Charles II, said all who disbelieved in witchcraft \nwere atheists. 50 \n\nDespite such protests, skepticism grew with the slow advance of \nthe Age of Enlightenment. In 1736, Scottish laws against the \n"crime" of witchcraft were formally repealed. Yet the church refused to \nkeep pace with the law. Forty years later, ministers of the Associated \nPresbytery passed a resolution declaring their unabated belief in witch- \ncraft. 51 As late as the 1920s a rector of four parishes in Norfolk could \nstill write: "If I were to take a census of opinion in all four villages I am \ncertain that I should find a majority of people seriously professing \nbelief in witchcraft, the policy of the \'evil eye,\' and the efficacy of both \ngood and evil spells." 52 The churches wouldn\'t let these beliefs die. \n\nChristianity, then, has been chiefly responsible for the survival and \ngrowth of witchcraft as an article of faith. It seems so still. In the \n1940s, Seabrook estimated that "half the literate white population in the \nworld today believe in witchcraft"; and the nonliterate nonwhite \npopulation attains a much higher proportion. 53 A Gallup poll taken in \n1978 showed that ten percent of all Americans believe in witches. 54 \n\nBut what is meant by "believe in"? It could mean a belief that \nthere are people who call themselves witches; this is self-evident \nenough. It could mean a belief that such people erroneously think they \nhave supernatural powers. It could mean a belief that such people \nreally do have supernatural powers. It could mean a belief that, as the \nchurch has always maintained, witches are agents of the devil, seeking \nto destroy the world out of sheer perversity. Or, it could mean a belief \nthat witches preserved an older and better religion based on worship \nof Nature and the female principle. \n\nThose who now call themselves witches usually uphold some \nversion of the latter belief. A modern witch, Leo Louis Martello, \nsays: \n\nWe worship and identify with the Horned God, Lord of the Hunt and the \nUnderworld, and the Mother Goddess, especially the latter (Mother \nEarth, Mother Nature). Without the female principle (women) man \nwouldn \'t be here. . . . Witchcraft is a pre-Christian faith. . . . It tends to \nbe matriarchal whereas both Christianity and Satanism are patriarchal and \n\n\n\nurn \n\n\n\nmale chauvinist. The latter two are merely opposite sides of the same Witchcraft \n\ncoin. Witchcraft, as the Old Religion, is a coin of a different vintage, \n\npredating both. 55 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nAsked how he feels about belonging to a heavily matriarchal \ntradition, one male witch answered: "I\'d rather be first mate on a ship \nthat is solid than captain on a ship that has a rotten hull, a ship that is \nsinking. Patriarchy is such a ship." Witches have defined patriarchy as \n"manipulative and domineering." The matriarchal world view, on \nthe other hand, values "feelings of connectedness and intuition . . . \nnonauthoritarian and nondestructive power relationships." It is \nclaimed that witchcraft tends to correct what W. Holman Keith called \nthe fundamental religious error of our time: "to substitute force as the \ndivine and ruling principle in place of beauty and love, to make \ndestruction, in which the prowess of the male excels, more important \nin life than the creativity of the female." 56 \n\nCertainly the history of witchcraft shows men persecuting women \nin order to maintain a male monopoly of profitable enterprises, such \nas medicine and magic. Women of outstanding reputation in any field \nwere at risk, since almost any woman\'s accomplishment could be \ndefined as witchcraft. When the church declared war on female healers, \nhealing became a crime punishable by death if it was practiced by a \nwoman. Women were forbidden to study medicine, and "if a woman \ndare to cure without having studied, she is a witch and must die." 57 \nDoctors eagerly participated in witch hunts, to eliminate their competi- \ntion. It was all done very deliberately. "Given the number of \ninstances in which the church combined with various economic groups \nfrom doctors to lawyers to merchant guilds, not only to make \npronouncements about the incapacities of women, but often to accom- \nplish the physical liquidation of women through witchcraft and heresy \ntrials, one can hardly say that it all happened without anyone intending \nit." 58 \n\nChurchmen who availed themselves of witches\' services some- \ntimes persecuted even those who helped them, in remarkable \nexamples of ingratitude. Alison Peirsoun of Byrehill was so famous as a \nhealing witch that the archbishop of St. Andrews sent for her when \nhe was sick, and she cured him. Later he not only refused to pay her fee, \nbut had her arrested, charged with witchcraft and burned. 59 \n\nThe muddy illogic of persecutors\' sexist thinking is nowhere better \nillustrated than in the notion of the witch\'s "poppet," or wax doll, \nwhich could be mistreated by piercing or melting in order to make a \nhuman victim suffer corresponding stabbing pains, fevers, and other \ntroubles. When the witch destroyed the doll altogether, the victim \nwould die. Yet oddly enough, when male authorities discovered the \ndoll and destroyed it, the victim would not die but would recover. A \nsimilar sexist attitude was apparent in the whole idea of traffic \nbetween human beings and demons. Burton\'s Criminal Trials of \n\n\n\n1089 \n\n\n\nWitchcraft Scotland stated that a male sorcerer is the master of demons, but a \n\nfemale witch is the slave of demons. 60 Yet her offense was usually \n^^^^^^^^ i^^ considered more punishable than his. \n\nModern witches, male and female, seem inclined to restore the \nsexual balance of old romances, where men\'s magical skills were \nacquired under feminine instruction. 61 The witches appear to be recon- \nstructing an old religion in a new format, gradually working out a \ntheology that owes more to ancient Indo-European models than to the \n"reverse Christianity" associated with the idea of Satanism. Important \npoints upon which this theology differs from Christianity are the \nfollowing: \n\n(1) The female principle is deified, equal to or greater than the \nmale. (2) Body and soul are seen as one and the same; one cannot ex- \nist without the other. (3) Nature is sacred, not to be abused or \n"conquered." (4) The individual will has intrinsic value and is not to \nbe subordinated to the "revealed" will of a deity. (5) Time is circular \nand repetitive; existence is cyclic; the figures of the Triple Goddess \nsymbolize constant repetitions of growth and decay. (6) There is no \noriginal sin, and no hard-and-fast separation of "good" and "evil" (for \nexample, a feast of fresh beef is good for the feasters but evil for the \nonce-living main dish). (7) Sexuality, spontaneity, humor, and play \nactivities may be incorporated into ritual, where the experience of \npleasure is regarded as a positive force in life, rather than a temptation \nor a sin. 62 \n\nThe Goddess speaks to modern witches in somewhat the same \nvein as the speeches drawn from her ancient scriptures: \n\nMine is the secret that opens upon the door of youth and mine is the Cup \nof the Wine of Life and the Cauldron ofCerridwen, which is the Holy \nGrail of Immortality. lam the Gracious Goddess who gives the gift of joy \nunto the heart of man upon earth. I give the knowledge of the Spirit \nEternal, and beyond death I give peace and freedom and reunion with \nthose that have gone before. . . . I who am the beauty of the Green \nEarth, and the White Moon amongst the stars and the mystery of the \nWaters, and the desire of the heart of man, I call unto thy soul to arise \nand come unto me. For lam the Soul of Nature whogiveth life to the \nuniverse; from me all things proceed and unto me all things must \nreturn. . . . I have been with thee from the beginning, and lam that whici \nis attained at the end of desire. 6i \n\n1. J.H. Smith, D.C.P., 241. 2. Bullough, 177. 3. White 2, 36. 4. Briffault 1, 488. \n\n5.

The day sacred to him was Wednesday \nWoden\'s Day. German churchmen eventually changed the name of \nthe day to Mittwoch, "mid-week," to prevent speaking of the heathen \ndeity\'s name. \n\nWednesday is Mercury\'s Day in Latin-based languages (Italian \nmercoledi, French mercredi, Spanish miercoles), because Woden- \nOdin was identified with the Roman Mercury (Hermes). As a \nConductor of Souls, Woden was associated with the cult of the dead, \nwho were formerly called "elves" in Scandinavia; therefore he evolved \ninto the Elven-king, Erl King, and leader of the Wild Hunt, when \nghosts rode through the sky at Halloween. As Hod, the slayer of the \nyear-god Balder, he appeared in his death mask and hood as a \nmalicious deity, Old Carl Hood, father of the greenwood-hero Robin. 1 \nChristians readily identified him with the devil because he was \nalready a fearful deity of death very like the Hindu Yama. \n\n1.

Wotan \n\n\n\nWolf \n\nSacred totem of many European clans during the Middle Ages, as \nshown by the frequency of the name Wolf or Wulf in place names and \nfamily surnames. The old Saxon year began with Wolf-monath \n(Wolf Month). Wolf mothers or wolf nurses figured prominently in the \nbiographies of pagan heroes. An early version of Siegfried was nursed \nby a divine she-wolf and was named Wolfdietrich. 1 \n\nWorship of the wolf among heathen clans led to innumerable \nsuperstitions about wolf-demons and werewolves. Wolves were asso- \nciated with death and reincarnation, since they were carrion eaters, \nformerly believed to carry the dead in their own bodies to the pagan \nheavens and hells. See Dog; Werewolf. \n\n1. Rank, 58. \n\n\n\nWomb \n\nThe Sanskrit word for any temple or sanctuary was garbha-grha, \n"womb." \' \n\nThe great annual festival of Aphrodite in Argos was called Hyste- \ni,"Womb." 2 \n\n\n\n1091 \n\n\n\nWorid ^ The oldest oracle in Greece, sacred to the Great Mother of earth, \n\nWormwood sea, and sky, was named Delphi, from delphos, "womb." \n\nMegalithic tombs and barrow-mounds were designed as "wombs" \n" "^^^^^^" to give rebirth to the dead. Their vaginal entrance passages show that \nNeolithic folk went to considerable trouble to devise imitations of \nfemale anatomy in earth and stone. Tomb and womb were even \nrelated linguistically. Greek tumbos, Latin tumulus were cognates of \ntumere, to swell, to be pregnant. The word "tummy" is thought to \nhave come from the same root. 3 \n\nWomb-temples and womb-tombs point backward to the matriar- \nchal age, when only feminine life-magic was thought efficacious. \nRebirth from the womb-tomb was the meaning of the domed funerary \nstupa of the Far East, where the remains of the sainted dead lay \nwithin a structure called garbha, the "womb." 4 The parallel with barro \ngraves, Mycenaean tholos tombs, cave temples, and other such \nstructures is now well known. Even a Christian cathedral centered on \nthe space called nave, originally meaning "belly." Caves and burial \nchambers were said to be sunk in the "bowels" of the earth that is, of \nMother Earth. The biblical term for "birth" is "separation from the \nbowels." \n\nArchetypal womb-symbolism is as common today as it ever was, \nthough not always recognized as such. Paul Klee said, "Which artist \nwould not wish to dwell at the central organ of all motion . . . from \nwhich all functions derive their life? In the womb of nature, in the \nprimal ground of creation, where the secret key to all things lies \nhidden?" 5 \n\n1. Campbell, CM., 168. 2. H.Smith, 126. 3. Potter & Sargent, 28. 4.

Her spirit was \nthought to inhabit grave-worms (maggots), for which the Old Norse \nword was mathkr, Old English matha both related to "mother." The \nmodern word descended from a Middle English derivative, mawke} \nLinguistically related to these "worms" were the Goddess\'s familiars oi \nmawkins. See Cat. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 238. \n\n\n\nWormwood \n\nArtemisia absinthium, wormwood, was sacred to the Great Mother. \nTrevisa wrote in 1398: "Artemisia is called mother of herbs, and was \n\n\n\n1092 \n\n\n\nsometime hallowed to the goddess that hight [is named] Artemis." \' Wudu-Maer \n\nIn Russia, wormwood or absinth was called an "accursed herb" because Xipe Totec \n\nit was sacred to the pagan nymphs (Vilas); but it had also protective ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmagic. 2 \n\nWormwood was a corruption of Old English wermod, "spirit- \nmother," which became German Wermut, French vermouth. \nAbsinthe was first prepared by French witches from artemisia, and \nbecame a commercial product in the 1 8th century, though it proved \nvery dangerous. Wormwood is a habit-forming drug that can destroy \nbrain cells and cause delirium; furthermore, commercial absinthe was \n68% alcohol by volume. 3 During the 19th century, the French govern- \nment outlawed its production. 4 \n\n1.

He was castrated and flayed, and the priest was clothed in his \nbloody skin, signifying the god\'s rebirth. 1 People carried new fire \nfrom his temple to re-kindle their household fires, believing that his \ndeath staved off the end of the world, at least for one more cycle. 2 \n\nXipe Totec was the son of the Demeter-like Corn-goddess Chico- \nmecoatl. Like all gods of crops, he suffered in imitation of reaping \nand grinding the grain. His flaying may have represented the husking of \nthe corn cobs. \n\n\n\n1093 \n\n\n\nXochiquetzal \nYahweh \n\n\n\nThe "Flayed One" bore a remarkable resemblance to the archaic \nHindu god Rudra, the Red One, or the Howler, or the Lord Who Is \nHalf Woman.

Like Syrian Adonis, her son-lover was a young vegetation god. 1 \n\nHer worshippers said Xochiquetzal was the mother of all races of \nhumanity after the primordial flood. Her many children were as \ndumb as animals until her holy spirit in the form of a dove descended oi \nthem from the Tree of Heaven and gave them speech. In this way all \nthe world\'s languages were created. 2 \n\nIn addition to the dove, another symbol Xochiquetzal shared with \nthe ancient Indo-European Goddesses was her sacred flower, the \nmarigold perhaps a New World version of the golden Thousand- \nPetaled Lotus representing the Great Mother in India. \n\nXochiquetzal\'s paradise was located "above the nine heavens in a \nvery pleasant and delectable place, accompanied and guarded by \nmany people and waited on by other women of the rank of goddesses, \nwhere are many delights of fountains, brooks, flower-gardens." 3 This \nfairyland was available after death to those who faithfully served the \nGoddess and lived according to her laws. \n\n1.

It \nwas also rendered Yah, Yahu, Jahveh, Jahi, or Jehovah, and has been \n\n\n\n1094 \n\n\n\nrelated to the name of the Canaanite moon deity Yareah, possibly a Yama \n\nfemale or androgynous form. A male Yahweh was married to the Yang and Yin \n\nCanaanite mother goddess Anat at Elephantine. 1 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe name of God pronounced Jaho, Iao, or Ieuw was applied to \nZeus-Sabazius as the nocturnal sun: a Lord of Death under the earth, \nlike Saturn. Jews called him Sabbaoth, "Lord of Hosts.". His Latin name \ncame from the same roots: Iu-piter, "Father leu," that is, Jupiter or \nJove. 2 \n\nJahi was also a very ancient Goddess, appearing in Persian scrip- \ntures as the maker and seducer of the first man. Like many other \nCreatresses, she mated with the primal serpent; she also gave the \nmenstrual "blood of life" to Eve. \n\n1. Hays, 85, 89. 2. Knight, D.W.P., 113. \n\n\n\nYama \n\nHindu Lord of Death, male counterpart of the Lady of Life, whose \nname was his own in reversal: Ma-Ya. In classic Hindu myth, however, \nYama\'s consort was his twin sister Yami, a feminine form of himself. \nThe Fates ordained that he should mate with her, in the manner of the \nPrimal Androgyne (see Androgyne). But Yama refused, saying he \nintended to keep himself pure. Because he detached himself from his \nfeminine half and renounced the life-supporting power of the female, \nhe became the first man to die. 1 He went into the underworld and \nbecame its king. \n\nThis myth presents an interesting reversal of the Judeo-Christian \nnotion that the sin of woman and sex brought death into the world. \nHere death came about through the sin of male asceticism; Yama \n"died" because he refused to be a sexual being. His followers revered \nhim as a psychopomp, like Hermes after his detachment from Aphro- \ndite: "Yama chose death, and he found out the path for many, and he \ngives the souls of the dead a resting place." 2 \n\nAs Lord of Death he took the title Samana, "the Leveller," and at \ntimes he wore the fearsome aspect of a blue-skinned, bull-headed \ndemon, the same as Sammael, the Angel of Death in the Book of \nEnoch. 3 Persians worshipped him as Yima the Splendid, the Good \nShepherd who gave men immortality. 4 In the ancient land of Canaan, \nhe became Yamm, Lord of the Abyss, annually cast down by Baal in \ntheir eternal contest for the favors of Astarte. \n\n1.

Most important was the Sri Yantra or Great Yantra, a design of \ntwo interlocking triangles representing time cycles and the union of \nGoddess and God (see Hexagram). 1 Worship of the yantra was meant \nto attain "unity with the Mother of the Universe." 2 \n\n1. Rawson, AT., 82. 2. Avalon, 428. \n\n\n\nYard \n\nFrom Scandinavian gard or garth, "world," the earth. 1 The church- \nyard descended from the old pagan tradition that a temple and its \nenvirons constituted a model of the universe, and those buried in the \nyard corresponding to the Greek koimeteria, "cemetery" automati- \ncally entered paradise because they were already in its vicinity (i.e., \nclose to the temple). This was the pagan belief underlying the Christian \nhabit of burying the pious in "consecrated ground" adjacent to the \nchurch. Refusal of such burial to criminals, witches, and other outcasts \nwas tantamount to sending them to hell, for it was believed that \nanyone buried in unhallowed ground was automatically damned. \n\nl.Lethaby.62. \n\n\n\nYggdrasil \n\n"Terrible Horse," or "The Horse of Ygg [the Ogre]"; Norse name of \nthe World Ash Tree that became Odin\'s gallows tree a gallows being \npoetically likened to a horse (drasil) on which men rode to Death. \nLike Christ\'s cross, Yggdrasil was depicted as the axis mundi. Its roots \nsupported the earth, its trunk passed through the world\'s hub, its \nbranches stretched over heaven and were hung with the stars. Under its \nroots by the Fount of Wisdom lived the three Fate-goddesses or \nNorns. A mighty serpent constantly gnawed at the tree and at doomsday \nwould succeed in toppling the entire structure. All the worlds it \nupheld Earth, heaven, Midgard, Asgard were destined to tumble \ndown and fall apart.

Rawson, E.A., 253. \n\n\n\nYmir \n\nTeutonic giant who died to give life to the universe. His flesh became \nthe soil; his blood became rivers and seas; his skull was the dome of the \nsky. The first couple of male-and-female beings emerged from the \nsweat of his left armpit. The race of dwarves evolved from maggots that \nbred in Ymir\'s rotting corpse. This pantheistic creation myth was \ndesigned to give primordial significance to a sacrificial god; but Ymir \nwas not really the first of all creatures. He was brought to life and \nnourished by the Cow-mother Audumla, "Creator of Earth." \n\nYmir\'s name has been related to the Sanskrit Yama, the oldest \nunderworld god in hermaphroditic guise as a producer of living \nthings. 2 As Odin was another form of Indra, so Ymir was the Yama \nremembered by Aryan tribes in their westward migrations. \n\nl.Urousse, 248. 2.

It was the term for sexual union between the Tantric sadhu and \nhis yogini, or Shakti, in imitation of the union between Kali and \nShiva. As Kali\'s consort, Shiva bore the title of "Lord of Yoga." l \n\nThe practice of yoga was supposed to develop magic powers \ncollectively called siddhi in northern Europe, sidh or seidr, "mag- \nic." The fully developed sage could walk on water, change base metals \nto gold, understand all languages, heal diseases, cast out demons, and \nso on. 2 The Moors called such a person a sidi, "hero."

Those who underwent this ceremony \nwere styled "twice-born." 2 \n\n1. Silberer, 170. 2. Frazer, G.B., 229. \n\n\n\nYonijas \n\nA Hindu myth of the battle of the sexes told of a quarrel between the \nGoddess Parvati (Kali) and the God Mahadeva (Shiva) over their rival \nclaims to the true parenthood of human beings. To decide the \nquestion, each proposed to create a race of people without the aid of the \nother. The God, spirit of the lingam or phallus, created the Lingajas, \nwho were weak and stupid, "dull of intellect, their bodies feeble, their \nlimbs distorted." \n\nHowever, the Goddess created the Yonijas, spirits of the yoni or \nvulva, who turned out to be excellent specimens: "well-shaped, with \nsweet aspects and fine complexions." 1 The two races fought a war, and \nthe Yonijas won. \n\nThis may have been one of the earliest myths of conflict between \nmale and female divinities over the matter of who did the creating. It \nwas still a matriarchal age, as shown by the way the Mother made more \nviable people than the Father could make. \n\n1. Simons, 57. \n\n\n\nvar. Yul Yule \n\nNorse solstitial festival, the season of the sun\'s rebirth, assimilated to \nChristmas in the Middle Ages, along with its pagan trappings: holly, ivy, \npine boughs, lighted trees, wassail bowls, suckling pigs, Yule logs, \ncarols, gifts, and feasting. \n\nSome said the god of Yule was Kris Kringle, i.e., a Christ of the \nOrb, a new solar king. But most northern folk remembered the \nreborn god as Frey. They said, "Yule is celebrated in honor of Frey." \' \n\nIn France it was celebrated in honor of another phallic god, like \nCernunnos, whose phallus was identified with the festive log, called \nthe Noel Log. Provencal folk songs mention the fertility magic of the \n\n\n\n1098 \n\n\n\nNoel Log, the ashes of which were traditionally mixed with cows\' Yu-Ti \n\nfodder to help them calve. 2 Zalmoxis \n\n1. Oxenstierna, 216. 2. Briffault 3, 101-2. ^^^^___^^__ \n\n\n\nYu-Ti \n\nChinese Heavenly Father, consort of Mother Earth (Wang-Mu). He \nwas known as the August Personage of Jade, or August Supreme \nEmperor of Jade. He lived in heaven in a palace exactly like the \nearthly emperor\'s palace. He was said to have made the first human \nbeings out of clay, like other archaic gods whose "creating" took \nplace before the concept of begetting was understood. 1 \n\n\\.Larousse, 381-82. \n\n\n\nZabat \n\nBerber name for sacred dances performed in groups of thirteen, in \nconnection with the magic ceremony called "an occasion of power"; \npossible origin of the so-called witches\' "sabbat." \' \n\n1. Shah, 210; Ravensdale & Morgan, 1 53. \n\n\n\nZagreus \n\nCretan bull-god and savior identified with both Dionysus the Son, \nand Zeus the Father. Zagreus was slain by the Titans (pre-Hellenic \ngods) as a sacrifice, then assimilated to his heavenly father and \nresurrected as a new copy of himself, by rebirth through the Mother \n(Rhea). \n\n\n\nZakar \n\nHebrew "male," from several ancient words for "penis." Zakar or \nZaqar was a phallic deity like Hermes in Babylon, where he was called a \nmessenger from the moon. Zekker, the Arabic word for "penis," \ncame from a similar Egyptian root: Seker, the Lord of Death, i.e., Osiris \nas the dead god (or phallus) hidden within the Mother\'s womb. See \nSeker. \n\n\n\nZalmoxis \n\nSavior of Thrace, worshipped by the Getae and identified with \nOrpheus. Zalmoxis promised eternal life to guests at his sacramental \n\n\n\n1099 \n\n\n\nZar Last Supper. Then he went into the underworld, and rose again on \nZephyr the third day or, by some accounts, in the third year. He established \nsacred Mysteries to teach the secrets of the after-life. Human sacri- \nfices to him were impaled, like victims impersonating Tmolus in Lydia \n(see Heracles). 1 Martyrdom as the spirit of Zalmoxis apparently was \ncoveted. If the victim survived after being hurled onto the points of \nspears, he was rebuked and designated a "bad man"; and another was \nchosen to die in his place. 2 \n\n1. Herodotus, 241-42. 2. Guthrie, 175. \n\n\n\nZar \n\nEthiopian demon, still worshipped by women as the spirit of their \nvoodoo-like cult of possession, to which they have recourse when \noppressed by their patriarchal society. The name Zar may be related \nto an ancient name of Osiris, worshipped during the first dynasty at \nAbydos as the god-king Zer, who became Lord of the Underworld. \n\n\n\nZen \n\nJapanese system of controlled meditation, to master various skills, \nespecially the martial arts. Zen was a mispronunciation of Chinese \nch \'an, which was in turn a mispronunciation of Sanskrit dhyana, \n"contemplation." \' Medieval knights of romance, who worshipped Di- \nana and followed a similar martial-arts cult, may have drawn their \ntradition from the same Oriental source. \n\n1. Campbell, M.T.L.B., 127; Or.M., 440. \n\n\n\nZenobia \n\nDynastic name of matriarchal queens of Palmyra. In their native \nAramaic, the name was Bath-Zabbai, or Bath-Sheba, meaning "Daugh- \nter of the Goddess." See Solomon and Sheba. The famous queen \nZenobia Septimia was the "seventh Bath-Sheba." x She had no official \nconsort. She named her son Wahab-Allath, "Gift of the Goddess \nAllath." Allath was the same Semitic Moon-mother whom Islam later \nmasculinized as Allah. 2 \n\n1. Encyc. Brit., "Zenobia." 2. de Riencourt, 75. \n\n\n\nZephyr \n\nGreek wind-spirit, capable of impregnating women or female ani- \nmals, as Boreas the North Wind was thought to impregnate mares. \nGreek phallic gods often appeared in carvings and amulets as "snake- \n\n\n\n1100 \n\n\n\ntailed winds." The idea that fatherhood resulted from sending air, Zeus \n\nbreath, or wind into a womb was not only a Greek idea. It was Ziusudra \n\ncommon to early patriarchal religions, which taught the male Oversoul ^^^^^^^^^^ \nwas nothing but air. See Soul. \n\n\n\nZeus \n\nGreek form of Sanskrit Dyauspitar, "Father Heaven," probably \nlinked with Babylonian myths of Zu the Storm-Bird, a thrower of \nthunderbolts. The Romans called him Jupiter, or Jove; the Jews \ncalled him Jehovah. \n\nUnlike the Judeo-Christian God who assumed his attributes, Zeus \nwas not a creator of humanity, nor even a giver of laws. The real \nCreator-lawgiver was the Goddess called either his mother or his wife: \nRhea, Hera, Gaea; in all her forms a "Virgin Mother of God." Zeus \nwas entitled Mamas, "Virgin-born Zeus." \' He was also identified with a \nnumber of dying gods, such as Zeus-Sabazius, Zeus-Zagreus, Zeus- \nSabaoth. Like Lucifer, he "came down" as rain or lightning to fertilize \nhis Mother, the earth. As a god of the fructifying bolt, he was known \nas Zeus Kataibates, "Zeus Who Descends." 2 He took over Mount \nOlympus, former shrine of Gaea Olympia. \n\nZeus eventually became the Olympic-Platonic patriarch, even \nclaiming to give birth to Athene the ancient Libyan Goddess of \nfemale wisdom from his own head. "With the spread of Platonic \nphilosophy the hitherto intellectually dominant Greek woman degen- \nerated into an unpaid worker and breeder of children wherever Zeus \nand Apollo were the ruling gods." 3 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 320. 2. Guthrie, 38. 3. Graves, G.M. 1,117. \n\n\n\nZiggurat \n\nBabylonian "Mountain of Heaven," the pyramid that served as \ntemple and palace in Mesopotamian towns. At its summit, the king \nconsummated his sacred marriage with the Goddess, this being the \npoint of contact between heaven and earth. Nebuchadnezzar\'s ziggurat \nwas built in seven stages, representing the seven planetary spheres. \nBeneath, seven nether pits represented the descent into the correspond- \ning seven spheres of the underworld. Such pits were used for \ndeath-and-rebirth ceremonies of priestly initiations. See Mountain. \n\n\n\nZiusudra \n\nSumerian prototype of Noah, the flood hero, carrying the seeds of a \nnew universe through watery Chaos between destruction of one world \nand the birth of the next. Sometimes spelled Xisuthros. See Flood. \n\n\n\n1101 \n\n\n\nZoe Zoe \n\nZurvan "Life," a Gnostic name of Eve, comparable to the Teutonic All- \n\n^^Ma^MBHHMB Mother Lif. \' Zoe was a daughter or emanation of the Gnostic Goddess, \nSophia, who gave Adam his soul. She also threw down to the Abyss \nthe unjust Creator, who had dared to curse her, and elevated the Lord \nof Hosts to the seventh heaven, where she undertook to instruct him \nabout the eighth, the Great Mother\'s dwelling place. Gnostic Gospels \nsaid Zoe\'s power alone animated the first clay man, after various gods \nhad tried to do it and failed. Therefore the man called her Mother of All \nLiving. 2 The canonical Bible kept her title, but eliminated her giving \nof life to Adam. \n\n1. Pagels, 30. 2. Robinson, 159, 166-69, 172-76. \n\n\n\nvar. Zarathustra Zoroaster \n\nPatriarchal Persian prophet whose name was affixed to many anti- \nfemale doctrines, such as the rule that no women could enter heaven \nexcept those "submissive to control, who had considered their hus- \nbands lords." \' Most women, of course, were destined to go to hell. \nAlong with much else, these sentiments were adopted from Zoroas- \ntrian teaching by the Jews and applied to the laws of Yahweh. \n\n1. Campbell, Oc.M., 196, 199. \n\n\n\nZorya \n\nThe "Three Fates" in Slavic myth. "Three little sisters, three little \nZorya: she of the Evening, she of Midnight, and she of Morning" i.e., \nof the old lunar calendars that figured the day from noon to noon. \nLike the Norns, the Zorya kept the doomsday-wolf fettered to the pole \nstar: "Their duty is to guard a dog which is tied by an iron chain to \nthe constellation of the Little Bear. When the chain breaks it will be the \nend of the world." l An Egyptian prototype of the triple Zorya was \nthe Goddess Reret, who kept the powers of destruction fettered by a \nchain. 2 \n\n1. Lamusse, 285. 2. Budge, G.E. 2, 249. \n\n\n\nZurvan \n\nArchaic Persian deity of Infinite Time, two-faced or two-sexed in \nZoroastrian symbolism. Zurvan must have been originally a manifesta- \ntion of the Two Ladies of life and death, like Kali who united Virgin \nand Crone aspects of female divinity. From the womb of Zurvan were \nborn the twins Ahura Mazda (God) and Ahriman (Satan). The \nformer twin became king of heaven because he made the right sacri- \n\n\n\n1102 \n\n\n\nfices. Ahriman\'s sacrifices were unacceptable, so he was banished to \nthe underworld and became the Great Serpent. 1 \n\nZurvan Akarana was worshipped as the First Cause, or principle of \ncreation, linked with Time, Destiny, and Fate: three common \ncharacterizations of the Goddess. 2 An ancient scripture said her divinity \ncould not even be addressed; it was "so incomprehensible to man that \nwe can but honor it in awed silence." ? Thus Zurvan was similar to the \nGnostic Goddess Sige, origin of all things in Silence. Ahura could \nhave been one of her early names. In Egypt, Ahura was feminine. 4 \n\nThe Zoroastrian pantheon assigned Zurvan to the dark side of \ndivinity as a demon of decrepitude, very like the Crone Kali who \nrepresented moribund old age. 5 Patriarchal thinkers characteristically \nemphasized the negative aspects of the destroying-and-creating God- \ndess, even when the primal character of the Mother of good, evil, time, \nfate, and the universe was clearly discernible under the veneer of later \nmyth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
