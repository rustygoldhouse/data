'Sacred alphabets of the ancient world signified birth and beginning by \nthe letter A. This letter meant the Creatress, who invented alphabets \nand gave them to mankind though most traditions said womankind \nhad them first. \n\nBabylonians called the Great Mother "A", the Beginning; or Aya, \nthe Mother of All Things. 1 Tantric sages called her birth-letter Alpa \nAkshara, "the letter A, which is considered the \'mother of all wisdom,\' \nand therefore of all men of genius; all Bodhisattvas and Buddhas are \nsaid to have been produced by \'A\'." 2 \n\nThe Greeks held similar views about the letter Alpha, which de- \nnoted the river of birth or creation. Its other name was Styx, the river \nof death, for in the cyclic system of the ancients, birth and death merged \nin a circular continuum. The river Styx circled seven times through \nthe earth\'s womb and emerged again as Alpha. \n\nX.Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 133-34. 2. Waddell, 161. \n\n\n\nAb \n\nEgyptian word for the heart-soul, most important of the seven souls: \nthe one that would be "weighed in the balances" by the Goddess Maat \nin the underworld Hall of Judgment after death. As in India, the \nheart-soul was pictured as a tiny dancer treading a constant rhythm in \nthe midst of the body, as Dancing Shiva or Dancing Kali kept the \nrhythm of life in the midst of the cosmos. The hieroglyphic sign of the \nab was a dancing figure. 1 See Heart. \n\n1. Budge, E.L., 44. \n\n\n\nvar. Abaton \n\n\n\nAbaddon \n\nThe god Apollo was a solar king in heaven during the day, and a \nLord of Death in the underworld at night. His latter form became the \nJewish Apollyon, Spirit of the Pit (Revelation 9:1 1). Apollo-Python \nwas the serpent deity in the Pit of the Delphic oracle, who inspired the \nseeress with mystic vapors from his nether world. The Greek word \nfor the Pit was abaton, which the Jews corrupted into Abaddon later a \nfamiliar Christian synonym for hell. \n\nAlso called a mundus or earth-womb, the abaton was a real pit, \nstandard equipment in a pagan temple. Those who entered it to \n"incubate," or to sleep overnight in magical imitation of the incubatory \nsleep in the womb, were thought to be visited by an "incubus" or \nspirit who brought prophetic dreams. 1 Novice priests went down into \nthe pit for longer periods of incubation, pantomiming death, burial, \nand rebirth from the womb of Mother Earth. Once initiated in this way, \nthey were thought to gain the skill of oneiromancy: the ability to \ninterpret dreams. \n\n\n\nThe Old Testament Joseph earned his oneiromantic talent by Abishag \n\nincubation in a Pit. The "brothers" who put him there seem to have \n\nbeen fellow priests. He could interpret Pharaoh\'s dreams only after he ^ \n\nhad submitted to the ritual. Assyrian priests derived similar powers \nfrom a sojourn in the Pit. 2 They then assumed the priestly coat of many \ncolors, signifying communion with the Goddess under her \noneiromantic name of Nanshe, "Interpreter of Dreams." 5 It seems \nlikely that Joseph\'s coat of many colors would have been given him \noriginally not before the initiation but afterward, by a "father" who was \nactually the high priest. 4 \n\nThe same burial-and-resurrection ritual is found in the lives of \nmany ancient sages. It was said of the Pythagorean philosopher \nThales of Miletus, accounted one of the Seven Wise Men of the \nancient world, that he derived his intellectual skills from communion \nwith the Goddess of Wisdom in an abaton. 5 \n\n1.

Larousse, 63. \n5. de Lys, 336. \n\n\n\nAbishag \n\nThe Bible claims the maiden Abishag was chosen for her beauty, to \nengender "heat" in the aged King David (1 Kings 1:2). This "heat" \nwas not mere warmth, but the sacred fire of sexual potency, without \nwhich no king could be allowed to rule. If an impotent king were kept in \noffice, his land would become barren. Hence, when David failed to \n"know" Abishag, a more virile prince (Adonijah) immediately prepared \nto assume the throne, and "exalted himself, saying, I will be king" \n(I Kings 1:5). David\'s death occurred with suggestive promptness after \nhis failure of the virility test. \n\nAbishag\'s name might be related to the Hindu abhiseka ceremony, \nthe anointing of kings with the sacred fluid of the Goddess Sarasvati. 1 \nFrom China to the Mediterranean, ancient kings derived their \nlegitimation from a mating with the Goddess through her priestess- \nsurrogate. 2 Mesopotamian kings and their deified souls, the gods, \nwere constantly described as "beloved" of the Goddess known as \ncreatress of the earth and "maker of fate, she who decrees the fate of \nthe men and gods." 5 Like the eastern Goddess, Abishag represented the \nland in the same way as Solomon\'s bride, whose mating was \nchronicled in the requisite intimate detail by the Song of Solomon. \n\nAfter David\'s death, the queen mother chose between rival candi- \ndates Solomon and Adonijah. She crowned Solomon with her own \nhands (Song of Solomon 3:11), after the custom of the royal women \nwhose business it was to enthrone or depose kings, as in India, Egypt, \nand the lands of the Fertile Crescent. 4 However, Adonijah still had \ndesigns on the throne, as shown by his request for the hand of \nAbishag in marriage. To prevent this symbolically and politically signifi- \ncant marriage from taking place, Solomon had Adonijah murdered \n\n\n\nAbortion (1 Kings 2:17-25). The Bible fails to explain Solomon\'s strangely \n\nviolent reaction to Adonijah\'s request; but it can only have meant that \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ the crown was at stake. This in turn shows that a sexual union with \n\nAbishag was a prerequisite for royal office. See Kingship. \n\n1. Gaster, 514. 2. Boulding, 191. 3. Pritchard, A.N.E. 1, 65; 2, 17, 21, 135, 202. \n4.Boulding,210. \n\n\n\nAbortion \n\nThe ancients generally viewed abortion as a woman\'s private busi- \nness, in which no man had any right to interfere. As Hartley put it, \n"Each woman must be free to make her own choice; no man may \nsafely decide for her; she must give life gladly to be able to give it well." 1 \nBut with the rise of patriarchal religions especially among the \nGreeks came a belief that a father\'s semen conveyed the soul to the \nfetus. Men feared for the safety of any of their body effluvia (hair \ncuttings, fingernail clippings, spittle, blood) lest sorcery might damage \nthe living man by damaging what was once a part of him. The fear \nwas particularly pronounced in the case of semen as an extension of the \nfather\'s soul. If the fetus he conceived were destroyed, then surely the \nman himself would suffer spiritual injury according to the principles of \nmagic. St. Thomas Aquinas held this same opinion, since he asserted \nthat semen was the vehicle of souls. 2 It was a logical extension of this \nnotion that abortion should be outlawed, not because it was danger- \nous to women, but because it was thought (magically) dangerous to \nmen. \n\nIn the east, however, abortion was perfectly legal at any time \nbefore the fifth month, when "quickening" was felt. After that, \naccording to Brahman scriptures, a woman who destroyed her fetus was \nheld guilty of murder, but before that time the fetus was soulless and \ncould be destroyed with impunity. 3 This opinion was embodied in the \nCatholic church\'s Doctrine of Passive Conception, which contradict- \ned Aquinas in order to prove that the soul comes only from God. Up to \nthe late 19th century, the Doctrine of Passive Conception declared \nthat the soul arrives in the fifth month of pregnancy, to quicken the \nfetus, which was previously soulless. 4 \n\nIn 1 869 the church again revised its opinion, tacitly admitting \neither that God had misinformed his church about his method of \ninstilling the soul into the body, or else that he had decided to alter it. \nPope Pius X announced that the soul was received at conception \nafter all. 5 \n\nActually, the church was only coming around, several decades late, \nto follow some new laws made by man, not by God. Abortion was \nnot classified as a crime in Europe until the 19th century. 6 The United \nStates first defined abortion as a criminal offense in the year 1830. 7 \n\nThe church now falsely pretends that it officially "always" opposed \nabortion. The medieval church\'s ire was aroused not by abortions per \n\n\n\nse but by the midwives who performed them. The handbook of the Abraham \n\nInquisition stated: "No one does more harm to the Catholic faith \n\nthan midwives." 8 (See Midwifery.) The church was not averse to ^^^^^^^^ \n\nkilling the unborn, since it burned many pregnant women as witches. \n\nEven the pregnant wife of a city councillor was tortured and burned at \n\nBamberg in 1630. 9 \n\nRecent opposition to legalization of abortion apparently stemmed \nfrom ignorance of how recently it was illegalized; and also from male \nbelief that women must be controlled by forcing childbirth on them. \n"Male legislators have laughed at the idea of the legalization of abor- \ntion, hinting at unprecedented promiscuity (on the part of women, not \nmen) if such a thing were allowed. Meanwhile, thousands of desper- \nate women die each year as the direct result of male laws making \nabortion illegal. Women are learning the meaning of this male \nlaughter and indifference in the face of the most hazardous and serious \nbiological enterprise women undertake, willingly or not." 10 \n\nThe Catholic church still claims authority over women\'s repro- \nductive functions. Catholic hospitals will refuse to abort even a fetus \nconceived by rape. 11 \n\nI. Hartley, 263. 2. Rees, 277. 3. Mahanirvanatantra, 269. 4. Briffault 2, 450. \n\n5.

But Islamic legends say Abraham was a \nlate intruder into the shrine of the Kaaba. He bought it from priestesses \nof its original Goddess. 1 Sarah, "the Queen," was one of the God- \ndess\'s titles, which became a name of Abraham\'s biblical "wife." 2 Old \nTestament writers pretended Sarah\'s alliances with Egyptian princes \nwere only love-affairs arranged by Abraham for his own profit which \nunfortunately presented him as a pimp (Genesis 12:16) as well as a \nwould-be murderer of his son (Genesis 22:10). \n\nIn the tale of Isaac\'s near-killing, Abraham assumed the role of \nsacrificial priest in the druidic style, to wash Jehovah\'s sacred trees \nwith the Blood of the Son: an ancient custom, of which the sacrifice of \nJesus was only a late variant. Jehovah first appeared to Abraham at \nthe sacred oak of Shechem, where Abraham built his altar. Later \nAbraham built an altar to the oak god of Mamre at Hebron. Even in \nthe 4th century a.d., Constantine said Abraham\'s home at the Oak of \nMamre was still a pagan shrine: "It is reported that most damnable \nidols are set up beside it, and that an altar stands hard by, and that \nunclean sacrifices are constantly offered." 3 \n\n1.

Abrasax \n\n\n\nAbraxas \n\nGnostic god identified with both Mithra and Jehovah, called "Our \nFather" and "Lord of Hosts" in the early Christian era. 1 Like Mithra, \nAbraxas represented "the 365 Aeons," 365,000 years allotted to the \npresent world\'s life span, based on the Hindu idea that one god- \nyear equals a thousand man-years. Jewish scripturists incorporated this \nbelief into Psalms 90:4, and into the First Book of Adam and Eve, \nwhere God said his five and a half days meant 5,500 years for man. 2 \nNumerical values of Mithra\'s and Abraxas\'s names each totaled 365. \nBoth were gods of numerology. \n\nOrthodox Christianity came to view Abraxas as a demon, because \nhe was assimilated to the Gnostic "Lord of This World" whose \nattributes were both divine and demonic. As the Creator of the material \nuniverse, he was declared a devil via the Gnostic opinion that all \nmatter was evil. Thus, he and his works the material world itself \nwould be destroyed at doomsday. 5 Nevertheless, through the Middle \nAges Abraxas was a favorite deity of several heretical sects. \n\n1. Budge, AT., 209. 2. Forgotten Books, 6. 3. Legge 2, 239. \n\n\n\nAbsalom \n\nThe Bible presents Absalom as either David\'s son or David\'s neigh- \nbor (2 Samuel 12:1 1) because biblical writers couldn\'t decide just where \nhe came from. He was important only as a surrogate "king" of the \nJews. His name, Father Salm, was a widely distributed sacred-king \nname, also rendered Salma, Salem, Salomon, or Solomon; in Assyria, \nShalmaneser; in Crete, the "son of God" Salmoneus. 1 The name \nmeant Prince of Peace, which was synonymous with Lord of Death \nbecause "Peace" was the Lord\'s word of farewell as he descended into \nthe underworld. \n\nCanaanites worshipped Father Salm at the city of Salem, whose \nPalestinian counterpart was Jeru-salem, "House of Salem." Kings of \nDavid\'s ancestral tribe, the Kenites, took the sacred name when ruling \nin Jerusalem. Probably several of these kings were called Solomon, \nincluding the biblical one whose real name was Jedidiah, according to 2 \nSamuel 12:25. \n\nAbsalom received the sacred name and died as a surrogate for the \nincumbent king, David, whose mourning for him was really a \nliturgical formula. He called Absalom "my son, my son," and cried \n"Would God I had died for thee" to disguise the fact that the victim \nreally had died in his place. Among ancient Semites generally, someone \nhad to die for the king at regular intervals, to preserve the fertility of \nthe soil and the people with his blood. See Kingship. \n\nTime-honored precedent dictated the format of the drama. The \nchosen victim sat on the throne, and publicly copulated with the royal \nwomen under a marriage canopy (2 Samuel 16:22). See Huppah. \n\n\n\nAfter this, Absalom was declared a god and his phallic spirit was Abtu \n\nimmortalized by an erect pillar (2 Samuel 1 8: 1 8). He was hung on a Achilles \n\nsacred oak "between heaven and earth," like all victims offered to ^^^^^^^^^ m \n\ndeities of the air and sky. 2 He was pierced through the heart by three \ndarts, like the Egyptian god Set. He was dismembered by ten men in \npriests\' livery (2 Samuel 18:14-1 5). According to the old custom, pieces \nof him were then distributed to the fields and vineyards to encourage \nthe growth of crops. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 363-64. 2. Angus, 173. \n\n\n\nAbtu \n\nThe "Abyss," sometimes called Fish of Isis, representing her genital \norifice, which "swallowed" the penis of Osiris. Abtu was the Egyptian \nname of Abydos, an early yonic shrine where the god died and \nentered his Mother\'s womb, the underworld. See Fish. \n\n\n\nAcedia \n\n"Abysmal apathy," ecclesiastical term for the acute depression afflict- \ning those in the monastic life. 1 They recognized that acedia \nmade monks and nuns especially susceptible to demonic possession. \nSee Possession. \n\n1. Mumford, 302. \n\n\n\nAchamoth \n\nMother Goddess who gave birth to the creator of the material uni- \nverse, according to early Gnostic Christians. 1 She was the third \nperson of a primordial female trinity consisting of Sige, Sophia, \nand Achamoth comparable to northern Europeans\' divine Great- \nGrandmother, Grandmother, and Mother. 2 The three of them \nchastised the male creator for excessive hubris and other offenses. \nSee Sophia, Saint. \n\n1. Legge 2, 69. 2. Turville-Petre, 147. \n\n\n\nAchilles \n\nHomeric hero of the Iliad, greatest of the Greek warriors at the siege \nof Troy. Achilles was a son of the Sea-goddess, here called Thetis, "She \nWho Disposes." Most of his body was invulnerable because his \nmother dipped him in the holy river Styx when he was an infant; but \nthe spot on his heel, where her fingers held him, was not exposed to \n\n\n\nAciel the magical waters. Therefore he could be, and was, killed by an arrow \n\nAdam in his heel, as was the Hindu Krishna. Hence any area of vulnerability \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ in an otherwise strong structure or person is known as an Achilles Heel. \n\nLike Heracles, Achilles lived for some time in female disguise, \nrecalling the priesthoods of Homeric and pre-Homeric times who \nwore women\'s clothing to attain the powers of divinity. \n\n\n\nAciel \n\nBlack Sun of the Chaldean underworld; the god of darkness at the \nbottom of the sevenfold Pit, exactly mirroring the gods of light at the top \nof the seventh heaven. Most underground gods and Lords of Death \nwere similar to Aciel Hades, Pluto, Saturn, Ahriman, Apollyon, \nPython, Zeus Chthonios, and their later composite, the Judeo-Christian \ndevil. Jewish writers made Aciel a "prince of Gehenna" and corrupted \nhis name to Arsiel. 1 He was not always devilish or evil. Oriental religions \ngenerally recognized that a principle of darkness was necessary to life, for \nonly in the nether darkness could regeneration take place. \n1.

They lied to the man, telling him the magic food of \neternal life would kill him if he ate it. So he refused it and lost his \nchance to escape death forevermore. 1 \n\nThe biblical God also showed concern lest human beings should \neat the food of eternal life (Genesis 3:22). God told Adam the same \nlie that the Babylonian god told Adamu: "Thou shalt not eat of it: for in \nthe day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Genesis 2:17). \nAdam ate, but he didn\'t die in the same day. On the contrary, he lived \nto the age of 930 years (Genesis 5:5). It was the serpent who told the \ntruth about the controversial food: "Ye shall not surely die; for God \ndoth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be \nopened, and ye shall be as gods" (Genesis 3:4-5). \n\nl.Hooke.M.E.M., 57-58. \n\n\n\nAdelphos \n\nGreek word for "brother," dating back to the matriarchal period \nwhen kinship was reckoned only through a mother.

In Jerusalem, his name was Tammuz. \n\nAdonis was born at Bethlehem, in the same sacred cave that \nChristians later claimed as the birthplace of Jesus. 1 He was the son of \nthe Virgin Myrrha, a temple-woman or hierodule, identified with Mary \nby early Christians who called Jesus\'s mother Myrrh of the Sea. 2 \nMyrrh was a symbol of the Lord\'s death, in both pagan and Christian \ntraditions. He returned to his Great Mother, the sea, Aphrodite-Mari. \nAlexandrian priestesses celebrated the event by throwing the god\'s \nimage into the sea. 3 \n\nSyrian Adonis died at Easter time, with the flowering of the red \nanemone, supposedly created from his blood. Its name was derived \nfrom his title, Naaman, "darling." He was also called the Beautiful God, \nlike other gods of the spring flowering, such as Narcissus, Antheus, \nHyacinthus. \n\nAnother form of the same god was Anchises, castrated after his \nmating with Aphrodite. Adonis, too, was castrated: "gored in the \ngroin" by Aphrodite\'s boar-masked priest. His severed phallus became \nhis "son," the ithyphallic god Priapus, identified with Eros in Greece \nor Osiris-Min in Egypt. Priapus carried a pruning knife in token of the \nLord\'s necessary castration before new life could appear on earth. 4 \n\nCastrating the god was likened to reaping the grain, which Adonis \npersonified. His rebirth was a sprouting from the womb of the earth. \nEach year, sacred pots called kernos or "gardens of Adonis" were \nplanted with wheat or millet, and allowed to sprout at Easter. The \ncustom was followed in Mediterranean countries up to the present \ncentury. 5 The clay pot signified the womb. Sometimes in processions \nit was a gigantic kernos carried on a chariot, having the special name \nof kalanthos. 6 \n\nAdonis died and rose again in periodic cycles, like all gods of \nvegetation and fertility. He was also identified with the sun that died \nand rose again in heaven. An Orphic hymn said of him: "Thou shining \nand vanishing in the beauteous circle of the Horae, dwelling at one \ntime in gloomy Tartarus, at another elevating thyself to Olympus, \ngiving ripeness to fruits." 7 He was buried in the same cave (womb) \nthat gave him birth. It is now the Milk Grotto, whose dust is supposed to \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\n\nbenefit nursing mothers; it was said Mary nursed Jesus there. 8 The Adultery \n\nGrotto was sealed as Jesus\'s sepulchre, for in the cults of both Jesus and Aeneas \n\nAdonis the virgin womb was the same as the virgin tomb, "wherein ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nnever man before was laid" (Luke 23:53). \n\nThe Magic Papyri said Jesus and Adonis also shared the same \nname-magic. "Adonai" was the highest god, having the True Name \nthat could work miracles. 9 Centuries later, Christian authorities declared \nthat "Adonai" was a demon. \n\n1. Doane, 155; Briffault 3, 97. 2.

Patriarchal societies therefore sought to insure \nwives\' sexual fidelity for economic reasons. 2 \n\nTo this end, the Bible commands stoning to death an adulterous \nwife or a bride suspected of oremarital affairs (Deuteronomy 22:21). \nThe latter rule was to invalicate the pagan custom of premarital \ndefloration by a stranger, lest someone other than the husband might \nhave a claim on the bride\'s property. 5 Hebrew patriarchs also considered \n"adulterous" a widow who might remarry "unto a stranger" outside \nthe paternal clan. Widows were ordered to marry the brother of a \ndeceased husband, so their property would remain under the control \nof male in-laws. This law of Levirate Marriage with its apparently divine \nsanction caused much trouble in later centuries. \n\n1. Brasch, 125. 2. Hartley, 165, 171. 3.

By the 7th century a.d. the agape ceremony was \ndeclared heretical, but it continued secretly throughout the Middle \nAges. 2 See Menstrual Blood. \n\n1. Attwater, 34. 2. Sadock, Kaplan & Freedman, 23. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\n\nAgatha, Saint Agatha, Saint \n\n"Kindly One," a spurious saint based on images of the lactating A gnes, Saint \n\nGoddess offering bared breasts in the usual Ishtar pose. As a fictitious p \n\n"virgin martyr," Agatha refused to marry the king of Sicily, who \n\nvengefully ordered her breasts sliced off. Early Christian icons showed \n\nher carrying them on a patera (offering dish) as St. Lucy carried her \n\neyeballs. 1 Later, the amputated breasts were misinterpreted as bells; so \n\nAgatha became patroness of bell founders. 2 Her legend may have \n\narisen from the Christian habit of knockingthe breasts off statues of \n\npriestesses and Goddesses. 3 \n\nThe original Agatha was surnamed Tyche (Fate), and worshipped \nat the subterranean womb-oracle of Trophonios at Lebadeia. 4 Like \nthe Goddess of the similar womb-oracle at Delphi, she was accompa- \nnied by a Great Serpent: the oracular spirit named Agathodemon, \ngod of Kindly Fortune, worshipped by Orphic sects up to the 5th and \n6th centuries a.d. Far from tormenting Agatha as her Christian \nlegend claimed, Sicilian kings won their thrones by way of a sacred \nmarriage with her. Many of these kings took the name of Agathocles, \n"Glory of Agatha," just as Heracles called himself "Glory of Hera." 5 \n\nThe Golden Legend conferred on St. Agatha the curious title of \nSavior of Her Country, saying "She accomplished the deliverance of \nher native land." 6 This probably referred to votive images of the \nGoddess which were supposed to preserve the land from all external \ndangers. \n\n1.

However, her true nature as an orgiastic priestess- \nheroine might be guessed from her ineradicable connections with \nlove and marriage. A priest became her bridegroom by placing a \nwedding ring on the finger of her statue, as if it were the statue of \nAphrodite-Galatea. 3 Bollandus\'s Acts of the Saints said Agnes founded \nher nunnery in a house of sacred prostitutes, like priestesses of \nAphrodite-Salacia. 4 All the way up to the present century, St. Agnes\'s \nEve was the traditional time for girls to divine the names of their \nfuture lovers by means of magic mirrors. 5 \n\n13 \n\n\n\nAgni Unfortunately for St. Agnes\'s credibility, she is said to have suf- \n\nAhriman fered in the reign of Constantine when Christians were not \n\n^ wmgn persecuted. It was also falsely claimed that Agnes cured Constantine\'s \ndaughter of leprosy. Roman Jews were said to have worshipped her in \na church on the Via Nomentana, built in her honor in 350 a.d.; but \nRoman Jews didn\'t worship Christian saints, and no churches were \nbuilt in honor of female martyrs in 350 a.d. 6 Roman Jews probably did, \nhowever, worship at least one version of Agna the Holy Lamb. \n\nThough Catholic scholars now say Agnes\'s legends have been \nfound "disappointingly" devoid of truth, her relics are still preserved \nin Rome and constantly adored by the faithful. 7 \n\n1.

She represented the primal ocean of blood from which all \nthings arose at creation; he represented the fructifying fire from \nheaven (lightning); their combination meant vital heat. Vedic sages said \nthe soul of all the universe, moving and still, is made of a combination \nof blood and fire. Agni also appeared to consume sacrifices that were \nburned on their altars. He was a prototype of such Indo-European \nfire-bringers as Lucifer, Prometheus, Etana, Hephaestus, and Heracles. 1 \n1.0\'Flaherty,97, 148,339. \n\n\n\nAhriman \n\nGreat Serpent, Lord of Darkness, and rival of the sun god in Persian \nmyth; leader of the daevas, whom Zoroastrians called devils, though the \noriginal Indo-Iranian word meant "gods." 1 (See Serpent.) \n\nThe story of Ahriman\'s revolt against his twin brother, the Heav- \nenly Father, of their war in heaven, and of the daevas\'faW to the \nunderworld, gave western Europe its basic myth of the fall of Lucifer, \nand its dualistic division of the universe between forces of good and \nevil. Persian prophets predicted the defeat of Ahriman and his dark \nangels during the final battle at the end of the world, and Judeo- \nChristian prophets adopted the same idea. As the Serpent, Ahriman also \ntempted the first man and woman. \n\nBut Ahriman was not considered inferior to the Heavenly Father. \nOn the contrary, they were twins, born simultaneously from the \nwomb of the primal Crone of Time (Zurvan). Ahriman\'s influence on \nearth was greater than his celestial brother\'s, because he created the \nmaterial world. Persian Magi regarded him as the source of their magic \npower, and offered sacrifices to him. Mithraic shrines from Budapest \n\n\n\n14 \n\n\n\nto York were dedicated to "Arimanius" as the underground god of \nmagic arts. 2 \n\nAhriman was not originally Persian. He was the Vedic god \nAryaman, maker of "Aryans" the people he created of clay. \nAryaman was one of the twelve zodiacal sons of the Goddess Aditi. 3 \nHe also had a Celtic incarnation, as the divine king Eremon. \n\nl.Lamusse, 317. 2.

O\'Flaherty, 339. \n\n\n\nAhura Mazda \nAkka \n\n\n\nAhura Mazda \n\nPersian sun god born as the twin brother of the dark god Ahriman \nfrom the womb of Infinite Time, the Primal Creatress. The fight \nbetween the brothers, resulting in Ahriman\'s fall from heaven, had \nthe same cause as the rivalry between Cain and Abel that is, the \nsacrificial offering of one was accepted by the older deity; that of the \nother was rejected. The older deity was Vayu, probably a derivative of \nthe Vedic celestial androgyne Varuna, or Mitra-Varuna, whose other \nname became "Mithra". \n\nThe story of the battle and the fall might have been a revision of \nthe ancient creation myth concerning the Goddess\'s punishment of \nher first-created serpent-consort for his hubris. 1 The name Ahura was \nonce a feminine name. 2 \n\nMiddle Persian forms of the name were Ormazd, Ormizd, or \nHormizd. These names were commonly taken by kings who embod- \nied the god\'s solar spirit, especially kings of the Iranian Sassanian \ndynasty. 3 Being naturally deified after death, such kings had cult \ncenters and groups of priests who kept up their worship. One of these \napparently became converted to Christianity and contributed another \napocryphal saint to the Christian canon, usually misspelled "St. Hor- \nmidz," though Hormizd was obviously meant. This saint was vaguely \nplaced in the 5th century a.d. and declared a Persian martyr, though his \nlegend lacked every kind of foundation, even that of common sense. \nIt was claimed that, for a refusal to renounce Christianity, St. Hormidz \nwas condemned to serve as a military camel-driver which may not \nhave been precisely a life of luxury, but hardly qualified as martyrdom. 4 \nThis sun-god-turned-saint was revered through the early Middle \nAges by cult centers located in Persia and Iraq. \n\n1.

She was the "Water-drawer" who \nbrought gods to birth out of the primal deep the feminine prototype \n\n\n\nvar. Ormazd, \nOrmizd, Hormizd \n\n\n\n15 \n\n\n\nAladdin of Aquarius. A similar Central-American Goddess figure had curiously \n\nsimilar names, Acat or Akna. 1 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Akka had many related names. Greeks called her Acco or Acca, \n\n"She Who Fashions." 2 To Lapps and Finns in northern Europe, she \nwas Mader-Akka Mother Akka who created humanity. 3 To Ro- \nmans, she was Acca Larentia, or Acca the mother of the Lares, which \nwere archaic ancestral spirits left over from pre-Roman Latium. \n\nAcca Larentia was variously called the first Vestal Virgin, or a \ntemple prostitute, or a rich courtesan, or a virgin bride of God roles \nthat may seem mutually contradictory but were not so (see Prostitu- \ntion; Vestal Virgins). As the divine midwife, she helped Rhea Silvia \ngive birth to Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome. She drew the \ndivine twins out of their floating basket on the river Tiber, just as \nAkka of Akkad drew Sargon out of his floating basket on the river Tigris, \nand "Pharaoh\'s daughter" drew Moses from the Nile. \n\nAcca Larentia was honored every year at the Roman festival of the \nLarentalia. She was assimilated to the cult of Heracles, who became \none of her husbands. In his Roman temple, Heracles was mated to \n"Acca, the Maker." 4 \n\n1. Lamusse, 439. 2. Graves, CM. 2, 190. 3.

As the fairy tale said, he was master of a \nsecret cave of treasures, but the cave was real. It was located in the \nfortified valley of Alamut near Kazvin, headquarters of the fanatical \nbrotherhood of hashish im or "hashish-takers," which Christians mis- \npronounced "assassins." \n\nAladdin was an Old Man of the Mountain, hereditary title of the \nchief of hashishim, beginning with a Shi\'ite leader Hasan ibn al- \nSabbah, whose name meant Son of the Goddess (see Arabia). The later \nname of Aladdin was taken by several chieftains. In 1297 the region \nof Gujarat was conquered by a warrior called the Bloody One, \nAla-ud-den. 1 \n\nBy means of drugs and an elaborate "paradise" staffed by human \nHouris, initiates into the brotherhood were persuaded that they died \nand went to heaven, or Fairyland, where gardens and palaces occupied \nthe valley of the secret cave. Special conduits flowed with the Four \nRivers of Paradise: water, wine, milk, and honey. Each candidate was \ndrugged into a stupor, then woke and "perceived himself surrounded \nby lovely damsels, singing, playing, and attracting his regards by the \nmost fascinating caresses, serving him also with delicate foods and \nexquisite wines; until intoxicated with excess of enjoyment amidst actual \n\n\n\n16 \n\n\n\nrivulets of milk and wine, he believed himself assuredly in Paradise, Alako \n\nand felt an unwillingness to relinquish its delights." 2 Alani \n\nAfter this period of bliss, the warrior was again drugged and taken ^^^^^^^^^^ \nout of the secret place, to fight in the service of the Old Man of the \nMountain. He fought fearlessly, in the belief that death in battle would \ninstantly carry him back to that heaven cleverly made real for him. \nPromises of sexual bliss were the real key to the ferocity of Islamic \narmies. The Koran said each hero who died in battle would achieve \nan eternity of pleasure among heavenly Houris with "big, beautiful, \nlustrous eyes." 3 \n\nAladdin\'s sect worshipped the moon as a symbol of the Goddess, \nlike the Vessel of Light associated with both the virgin Mary and the \nHoly Grail in western Europe. 4 Eastern poets said the Vessel of Light \nproduced djinn, "spirits of ancestors." This Vessel was simultaneous- \nly Aladdin\'s lamp, source of djinni (a genie), and the moon, source of all \nsouls according to the most ancient beliefs. The moon was the realm \nof the dead, and also the realm of rebirth since all souls were recycled \nthrough many revolutions of the wheels of Fate. The divine Houris \nalso dwelt in the moon, which probably was the light of Aladdin\'s secret \ncave. See Moon. \n\nThe Arabian Nights gave the password to Aladdin\'s cave: Open, \nSesame. This was related to Egyptian seshemu, "sexual intercourse." \nThe hieroglyphic sign of seshemu was a penis inserted into an arched \nyoni-symbol. 5 Every ancient culture used some form of sexual \nsymbolism for the idea of man-entering-paradise. \n\nl.Zimmer ( 54. 2.

Trigg, 202. \n\n\n\nAlani \n\n"Hunting dogs," Greek name for the Scythian tribes who wor- \nshipped Artemis as their Divine Huntress. The name Alan still carried \nthe original Greek meaning of a hunting dog when it became popular \namong the Scots during the Middle Ages. Artemis was often called the \nGreat Bitch, and her hunting priestesses were the "sacred bitches" \nwho chased, killed, and consumed boar-gods and stag-gods like Phorcis \nor Actaeon. Thus, to Christians, "son of a bitch" meant a devil \nworshipper that is, a pagan devotee of the Goddess. See Dog. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n\n\nAlban, Saint Alban, Saint \n\nAlchemy Fictitious saint called "protomartyr of England," allegedly the first \n\nmmmmtammmatmm Christian martyr in the British isles, slain on Holmhurst Hill in 287 a.d. \nHowever, no writer made any reference to him until two hundred \nyears later. Gildas finally developed St. Alban\'s legend in the 6th \ncentury, with some confusion of dates. He claimed St. Alban shel- \ntered a Christian fleeing from Diocletian\'s persecution, twenty years \nbefore Diocletian\'s persecution began. 1 \n\nThe real origin of St. Alban probably was nothing more than the \nBritish Goddess\'s title of Albion, "White Moon." Her shrine at \nHolmhurst Hill had a sacred fountain, always shown between the feet of \n"Alban" in Christian art. 2 In Bede\'s day the place was still holy, and \nsomeone had to invent a Christianized and preferably masculinized \nlegend for it. \n\nl.Attwater, 37. 2. Brewster, 293. \n\n\n\nAlberich \n\nKing of the underworld in Teutonic myth, identified with the Saxon \nfairy-king Oberon. Alberich appeared in the Nibelungenlied as a chtho- \nnian dwarf master-smith, guardian of the Rhinemaidens\' buried \ntreasure. Like most versions of the demonic fairy king, he was a shape- \nshifter, appearing in such typically diabolic disguises as a toad and a \nserpent. He is still familiar to opera fans as a character in Wagner\'s Ring \nof the Nibelung. \n\n\n\nAlchemy \n\nIn Arabic, alchemy meant "matter of Egypt," Al-Khemeia, from \nKhemennu, "Land of the Moon," an old name for Egypt. 1 The Arabs \nthought alchemy was invented by Egyptians. Christians learned it \nfrom the Arabs and believed it was invented by Thoth, or Hermes, or \nthe virgin Mary. 2 \n\n"Mary the Jewess" was said to have been the first great alchemist. \nShe discovered distillation of alcohol in the time of the Caliphate, and \ninvented the double boiler, still called bain-marie (Mary\'s bath) in \nFrance. During the Renaissance some female alchemists were perse- \ncuted as witches. Julius, Duke of Brunswick, roasted one of them alive \nin an iron chair in 1 575, because she could not tell him how to make \ngold out of base metal. 3 \n\nAs a system of mysticism, alchemy was permeated by sexual \nsymbols. So-called "copulations" and "marriages" figured in alchem- \nical procedures. Sexual drawings enlivened the texts. The Alchemical \nRebus was the usual bisexual image of male and female powers in \nunion, "a Hermaphrodite, born of two mountains, Mercury and \n\n\n\n18 \n\n\n\nVenus." Sun and moon were shown as naked male and female Alchemy \n\nfigures, the moon saying to her spouse, "O Sun, thou dost nothing \n\nalone if I am not present with my strength, as a cock is helpless - - \n\nwithout a hen." 4 \n\nAlchemists sought the divine female power Sapientia, or Sophia \n(Wisdom), the Gnostics\' Great Mother. Valentin\'s L\'Azoth des \nphilosophes showed her as a crowned, fish-tailed Aphrodite rising from \nthe sea, spouting streams of milk and blood from her breasts. This \nwas a direct copy of Hindu representations of the virgin Maya, mother \nof the world. 5 Alchemists called her the Siren of the Philosophers, \n"born of our deep Sea (Maria), who pours milk and blood from her \npaps." 6 \n\nAn Italian manuscript showed two bearded sages avidly sucking \nher breasts, to absorb the secrets symbolized by her colors, milk white \nand blood red. 7 The same colors appeared on the Flower of the \nAlchemists, a five-petaled red-and-white rose, sometimes called the \nwomb of the FiJium philosophorum or Glorious Child. The same rose \nsymbolized the virgin Mary. 8 \n\nMary-Sophia was the Goddess of both Gnosticism and alchemy. \nThe Philosopher\'s Stone was sometimes called the Sophistical \nStone. 9 Alchemical writings called the hidden Goddess the Mother of \nWisdom, combining elements of the Madonna with those of the \npagan mother-image: \n\nlam the flower of the fleldand the lily of the valleys. lam the mother of \nfair love and of fear and of knowledge and of holy hope. . .lam the \nmediator of the elements. . . . lam the law in the priest and the word in \nthe prophet and the counsel in the wise. I will kill and I will make to \nlive and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. 10 \n\nSince the ancient Great Mother was represented by a Holy \nVase, alchemists sought the vas hermeticum (Womb of Hermes), which \nresembled the vas spirituale identified with the virgin Mary. Arab \nalchemists adopted the rosary from Far-Eastern cults of the Goddess, \nwhose rosary-symbol was a vase-shaped bead, from which the other \nbeads were said to "spring up." Rosaries dedicated to Mary also had the \nvase-shaped bead. Arabs called the rosary wardija, "rose-garden," \ncopying the Hindu japamala, "rose-chaplet," the necklace of Kali Ma, \nwho ruled the elements as alchemists also hoped to do. A Diirer \ndrawing of 1 506 shows a turbanned Arab alchemist with his rosary at his \nbelt. 11 \n\nMany alchemical texts presented obvious sexual allegories, e.g. \nfrom the Turba Philosophorum: "Take the white tree, build him a \nround, dark, dew-encircled house, and set in it a hundred-year-old man \nand close it so that no wind or dust can get to him; then leave him \nthere eight days. I tell you that that man will not cease to eat of the fruit \nof that tree till he becomes a youth. O what a wonderful nature, for \nhere is the father become son and born again." 12 \n\nSimilar allegorical references to the mysteries of reproduction were \n\n19 \n\n\n\nAlchemy common among Chinese alchemists, who spoke of attaining "longev- \n\nity through liquid gold," by "a red sulphurous ingredient in \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ goldmaking" the male and female essences in Taoist and Tantric \nsymbolism (see Menstrual Blood). One text said: \n\n/ must diligently plant my own field. There is within it a spiritual germ \nthat may live a thousand years. Its flower is like yellow gold. Its bud is \nnot large, but its seeds are round and like unto a spotless gem [i.e., the \nJewel in the Lotus]. Its growth depends upon the soil of the central \nplace [womb], but its irrigation must proceed from a higher fountain. Alter \nnine years [or, months] of cultivation, root and branch may be trans- \nplanted to the heaven of the higher genii. n \n\nChurchmen were baffled by alchemical language, and usually \nlet practitioners of this particular "devilish art" alone, unless they were \nwomen. Yet the official opposition to the whole science kept many of \nthe best minds away from it, thus helping to retard the development of \nmodern chemistry out of alchemical experimentation. 14 \n\nThe deep secrecy of the alchemists\' operations still puzzles many \nmodern scholars. Carl Jung wondered why these chemical processes \nhad to be disguised and distorted by thickets of mythological symbolism; \nor, if a mystical sort of enlightenment was being described, why it was \ntied to laboratory procedures. 15 The answer could be found in the \nalchemists\' political environment. "Natural science" was often de- \nfined as heresy by the church. In periods when the Inquisition was \nactive, almost anyone meddling with such matters was at risk. The \nbest defense was deliberately obscure allegorization, in which theologi- \ncal principles if any could be hidden. \n\nSome of the secret is given away by the preponderance of sexual \nsymbols in alchemical literature. "Copulation of Athene and Her- \nmes" might mean mixing sulfur and mercury in a retort; or it might \nmean a sexual "working" of the alchemist and his lady-love. Illustra- \ntions in alchemical books suggested sexual mysticism more often than \nnot. Adam and Eve were shown as naked lovers, halves of the Primal \nAndrogyne. Adam was pictured as incomplete male, who had to be \npierced by the Arrow of Mercurius to stimulate his passionate desire \nfor Wisdom. After this, his phallus bloomed into the flowering Tree of \nLife, signifying that he was ready for full union with a Goddess-like \nEve, who would make him complete. 16 \n\nMercurius or Hermes was the alchemical hero who fertilized \nthe Holy Vase, a womb-like sphere or egg from which the films \nphilosophorum was to be born. This vessel may have been real, a \nlaboratory flask or retort; more often, it seemed to be a mystical \nsymbol. 17 The Royal Diadem of its offspring was said to appear in \nmenstruo meretricis, "in the menstrual blood of a whore," who may \nhave been the Great Whore, an ancient epithet of the Goddess. Her \nmenstrual blood curdled in her womb to create the universe, including \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\n\nits metals, minerals, and other raw materials of alchemy. The Rosar- Alchemy \n\nium Phibsophorum (Rosary of the Philosophers) said the soul of the \n\nworld is made of male and female "matters": Anima est Sol et Luna. ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSimilarly a human soul was produced by male and female parents. \n\nSexual mystics held a theory that every individual person or thing had \n\nbut half a soul, which must find its other half in the opposite sex. 18 \n\nAt times the alchemists appeared to be seeking a lost deity, like the \ncabalists\' Shekina: the Mother {mater) sleeping in the material matter \nof the world, having been separated from the God whose other half she \nwas. Alchemists usually rejected the church\'s teaching that matter \nwas "evil" or "fallen." As Gnostic animists they thought the "savior" \ndestined to emerge from the alchemical matrix (mother-womb) was \nboth an anthropomorphic Glorious Child or Hlius macrocosmi, and a \n"miraculous stone" or Philosopher\'s Stone, possessing corpus, anima, \nspiritus, the "redeemer" of the inanimate universe. 19 As an enlightened \nmystic the alchemist hoped to attend the birth of this strange being, \nwho would teach him to transform base metals into gold, as eastern \nyogis were said to do when they were sufficiently enlightened. \n\nOne reason why the church opposed alchemy and identified it \nwith black magic was that many alchemical texts offered greater \nrevelations, more simply achieved, than the Bible or the pulpit could \noffer, and thus took on the character of a rival. For example, the \nAbtala Jurain (1732) presented the whole creation: \n\nTake of common rainwater a good quantity, at least ten quarts; preserve it \nwell sealed in glass vessels for at least ten days, then it will deposit \nmatter and feces on the bottom. Pour off the clear liquid and place it in a \nwooden vessel that is fashioned round like a ball; cut it in the middle \nand Hll the vessel a third full, and set it in the sun about midday in a secret \nor secluded spot. \n\nWhen this has been done, take a drop of the consecrated red wine \nand let it fall into the water, and you will instantly perceive a fog and a \nthick darkness on top of the water, such as also was at the first creation. \nThen put in two drops, and you will see the light coming forth from the \ndarkness; whereupon little by little put in every half of each quarter hour \nfirst three, then four, then live, then six, drops, and no more, and you \nwill see with your own eyes one thing after another appearing by and by \non top of the water, how God created all things in six days, and how it \nall came to pass, and such secrets as are not to be spoken aloud and I also \nhave not power to reveal. Pall on your knees before you undertake this \noperation. Let your eyes judge of it; for thus was the world created. Let all \nstand as it is, and in half an hour after it began it will disappear. \n\nBy this you will see clearly the secrets of God, that are at present \nhidden from you as from a child. You will understand what Moses has \nwritten concerning the creation; you will see what manner of body Adam \nand Eve had before and after the Fall, what the serpent was, what the \ntree, and what manner of fruits they ate; where and what Paradise is, and \nin what bodies the righteous shall be resurrected; not in this body that \n\n\n\n21 \n\n\n\nAlcmene we have received from Adam, but in that which we attain through the \n\nAllah Holy Ghost, namely in such body as our Savior brought from \n\n^^_^^__^_^_ Heaven. 20 \n\n1.

It was houloi in Greek, uluktus in Latin, hulluloo or hulla-baloo \n\nin Old Irish. 1 Herodotus said the "howlings in the temple" were derived \n\nfrom the cult of Athene in Libya, where "the women do it very \n\nwell." 2 \n\nAlleluia was used as a battle cry in the Middle Ages, and credited \nwith powerful victory-magic. The legend of St. Germain describes its \nuse in a battle between Saxons and Britons. As the cry of the god \nPan was supposed to cause "pan-ic" in his enemies, so the sound of \nalleluia was thought to kill the enemy\'s fighting spirit. 3 \n\nl.Hazlitt, 341. 2. Herodotus, 270. 3. de Voragine, 399. \n\n\n\nAlma Mater \n\n"Soul-Mother," a Roman teaching priestess, especially one empow- \nered to give instruction in the sexual Mysteries. (See Cowrie). The \nname was based on Al-Mah, a Middle-Eastern name of the Moon- \ngoddess, also a title of her temple women, almah the same word that \ndescribed the virgin Mary in the Hebrew versions of the Gospels. 1 \nThe priestess called alma materbore a relationship to the male initiate \nsimilar to that of the Tantric Shakti. \n\nl.Brasch, 25. \n\n\n\nAlphabet \n\nSee Motherhood. \n\n\n\nAltar \n\nThe custom of burying relics of saints under an altar began with a \nmisunderstanding of the scripture, "I saw under the altar the souls of \nthem that were slain for the word of God" (Revelation 6:9). This was \nbased on a pagan teaching, that the souls of the enlightened became \nstars in heaven. Those recently deceased stood on the border of the \nsky, under the constellation of the Altar, which lies close to the horizon \nas seen from Mediterranean latitudes. 1 \n\nThe Altar was a feminine constellation because the earliest altars \nwere modeled on the maternal hearth, and altars symbolized the \nMother. The Earth\'s regenerative womb was often represented as an \n\n\n\n23 \n\n\n\nAl-Uzza \nAmazons \n\n\n\naltar, which explains why "witch cults" were said to make an altar of \nthe belly of a living woman. The Heavenly Virgin was also an altar, Ara \nCoeli, "Altar of Heaven," she who received the souls of the dead. \nChristians adopted this symbolism from the virgin Mary. One of the \nNativity legends claimed the Cumaean Sybil showed Augustus a \nvision of Mary, saying, "This woman is the Altar of Heaven." A church \nwas built on the spot, and named Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. 2 \n\n1 .

Graves, W.G., 395. \n\n\n\nGaius Tranquillus \nSuetonius Roman \nbiographer and \nhistorian, ca. 70- \n\n122A.D. \n\n\n\nHerodotus Greek \nhistorian of the 5th \ncentury B.C. \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\nGreek name for Goddess-worshipping tribes in north Africa, Anato- \nlia, and the Black Sea area. 1 Due to an erroneous belief that Amazon \nwarriors destroyed the right breast to be unhindered in drawing the \nbow, some derived the name from a-mazos, "breastless." But Greek rep- \nresentations of Amazons showed no such mutilation. The idea may \nhave arisen from Asiatic icons of the Primal Androgyne with a \nmale right half and female left half, echoed by a coalescence of the \nAmazon Goddess Artemis with her brother-consort Apollo. Scholars \nnow say the word Amazon meant "moon-woman." 2 \n\nSuetonius said, "Amazons once ruled over a large part of Asia." As \nlate as the 5th century a.d., the Black Sea was still known as the \nAmazon Sea.* Libya which used to mean all of North Africa except \nEgypt was also Amazonian. Herodotus spoke of Libyan Amazons. \nDiodorus, first century Greek historian, called them "the warlike \nwomen of Libya." To this day, north African Berbers call themselves \nAmazigh, though their common name came from Latin barbari, \n"barbarians." 4 \n\nThe ancients said Amazons were the first to tame horses, which \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\n\nmay well account for their armies\' legendary invincibility. 5 In open \ncountry, mounted troops whether male or female would have a decided \nadvantage over foot soldiers. \n\nIn Amazonian myths, the Goddess was often worshipped as a \nmare: India\'s mare-mother Saranyu, mare-headed Demeter, or \nCretan Leukippe the "White Mare," whose priests were castrated and \nwore female dress. 6 Among Scythians also, men entered the service \nof the Goddess by castrating themselves and adopting women\'s cloth- \ning. The only deity shown in Scythian art was the Great Goddess, \nwhom the Greeks called Artemis, or Hestia, or Gaea (the Earth). 7 \nSome of the Scythians settled in Parthia, "Virginland," named after \ntheir Goddess. They came to be known as Sacae, and their chief city \nwas Sacastene, now Seistan. 8 \n\nScythians were governed by priestess-queens, usually buried alone \nin richly furnished kurgans (queen-graves). Five kurganswere discov- \nered together at Pasyryk in southern Russia in 1954. Scythian \npriestesses were elder women, old enough to have gray hair. They \nperformed traditional sacrifices, catching the blood in sacred cauldrons \nand taking omens from the entrails. They also accompanied their \narmies into battle, to cast spells for victory. 9 \n\nThe moon-sickle used in mythical castrations of gods was a \nScythian weapon. A long-handled form therefore came to be called a \nscythe, and was assigned to the Grim Reaper, who was originally Rhea \nKronia in the guise of Mother Time, or Mother Death the Earth \nwho devoured her own children. Scythian women apparently used such \nweapons in battle as well as in religious ceremonies and agriculture. \nDiodorus said Scythian women "fight like the men and are nowise \ninferior to them in bravery." 10 A Scythian girl was allowed to marry \nonly after she had killed three enemies in battle. 11 \n\nIt wasn\'t unusual for barbarian armies to include women. Femi- \nnine magic power was often considered necessary for victory. The \nBible says Barak commanded an army of 10,000 men, but refused to go \ninto battle unless the priestess-queen Deborah went along, to cast \nvictory spells for him (Judges 4:8). Tacitus told of druidic forces \nrepelling Roman invaders on the island of Mona (Moon) in 61 a.d.: \namong the soldiers, black-clad women waved swords and cursed the \nenemy "like the Furies." 12 \n\nGreek myth says Amazon tribes occupied Cappadocia, Samo- \nthrace, and Lesbos, and founded the cities of Smyrna, Ephesus, \nCymes, Myrine, and Paphos all leading centers of Goddess-worship. \nAmazons came to the aid of matriarchal Troy in the Trojan War. \nThe Amazon queen Penthesileia fell beneath the sword of Achilles, \nwho immediately violated her dead body. Homer attributed this \nnecrophilic act to Achilles\'s love of her beautiful corpse. More likely, it \nwas a magic charm to immobilize her vengeful spirit. Greeks feared \nthe ghosts of slain Amazons. They called them Beautiful Ones, built \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\n\n\nCornelius Tacitus \n\nRoman historian \nand rhetorician, ca. \n56-120 a.d. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\n\n\nLebor Gabala \nErenn, also called the \nBook of Conquests: \nearly-medieval Irish \nhistory, purporting to \ntrace the origins of \nthe Irish tribes back to \nthe time of Adam. \n\n\n\nshrines to them, and offered them propitiatory sacrifices for centuries \nafter the war. 13 \n\nTheseus, king of Attica, violated the Amazons\' law of matrilocal \nmarriage by kidnapping their queen, variously named Hippolyta, \nAntiope, or Melanippe (Black Mare). Some said Antiope was the sister \nof Hippolyta. The former was slain by Theseus, the latter by \nHeracles, who wished to steal her magic girdle. Enraged, the Amazons \ninvaded Greece, ravaged coastal towns, and besieged Athens. 14 \nAmazons and Greeks became hereditary enemies. A later Amazon \nqueen named Artemisia (Spirit of Artemis) joined Xerxes to fight the \nGreeks at the battle of Salamis in 480 b.c. not because she loved \nPersians, but because she hated Greeks. 15 \n\nGreek myths mention several Islands of Women, where Amazons \nlived without men, only consorting with neighboring colonies of \nmales at certain seasons when they wanted to conceive their children. \nTaurus, Lemnos, and Lesbos were said to be such all-female societ- \nies. The Greeks apparently feared them. They said the women of \nTaurus sacrificed to their Goddess all men who landed on their \nshores; and the women of Lemnos had risen up against their husbands \nand murdered all of them at once. 16 The Greek writers seemed to \nhave no doubt that women could destroy whole populations of adult \nmales, and there was no effective defense against them. \n\nNorthern Europe had mythical Amazons: the Valkyries, warrior- \nmaidens of Valhalla. There were also real Amazons among the \nVikings: female captains and war-chieftainesses. 17 In the 10th century \na.d. a Norwegian fleet invaded Ireland and devastated Ulster and the \nnortheast, under the command of a warrior queen called the Red \nMaiden. 18 Another warrior queen, Olga, was one of the first rulers of \nKiev. 19 Medieval historians said Amazons ruled the city of Ulm from \nbefore the time of Abraham to the time of Alexander the Great. The \ncity was named for the sacred elms (ulmae) of the grove where they \nworshipped Diana-Artemis. 20 \n\nAgain and again, legends mention the women\'s magic battle-cries, \nwhich made their enemies helpless. The Valkyrie Kara deprived her \nenemies of power to wield their weapons by the sound of her voice. 21 A \nCeltic Valkyrie, Nemhain, cursed Cu Chulainn\'s warriors and made \na hundred of them drop dead on the spot. 22 \n\nThe Lebor Gabala Erenn Book of the Taking of Ireland said \nthe very first expedition of colonists to Ireland was led by a woman. 23 \nIreland had female soldiers up to the 7th century a.d., when Christian \nlegal reforms forbade women to bear arms. 24 The tradition persisted \nin connection with weddings. A bride\'s costume up to the 17th century \nincluded a knife at the belt. 25 But after the 9th century, female \nwarriors in Celtic lands were labeled "witches." 26 In the Amazons\' \nterritory around the Black Sea, women retained certain Amazon \n\n\n\n26 \n\n\n\ncustoms up to the 18th century: dressing in men\'s clothes, riding Ambrosia \n\nhorseback astride, and fighting beside the men in war. 27 Amphitrite \n\n1.

In the Acts of the Apostles, Ananias \nwas (1) a holy man, Paul\'s instructor, who accepted Paul\'s faith; (2) an \nenemy, who struck Paul and publicly shamed him; and finally (3) "a \nliar unto God," who held back some of his money from the apostles, \nthough they seemed to think he must surrender all of it. For this \noffense, St. Peter made Ananias "fall down dead" along with his wife \nSapphira, and young men of the apostles\' sect buried them. The \napostles were imprisoned for murder, but "an angel" came secretly at \nnight and let them out of jail (Acts 5:1-19). \n\nThis curious story was much repeated in connection with collec- \ntion of church taxes. Withholders of tithes were called "liars" like \nthe sinful Ananias. \n\n\n\nAnaximander \n\nMilesian philosopher, \nastronomer, and \ngeographer, 6th \ncentury B.C. \n\n\n\nAnanke \n\n"Necessity," a Neoplatonic-Pythagorean title of the Goddess who \ngoverned the world according to karmic law; another name for Fortuna, \nor Fate. "What we call causality in the West has its roots in the \nGreek images of Ananke (Necessity), Dike (Justice), Heimarmene \n(Allotted Fate), and Nemesis (Retribution) all goddesses which \nwere feared and respected." Anaximander said it was according to \nAnanke that the "source of generation for all things is that into which \ntheir destruction also leads." Stoic philosophers made Ananke or Hei- \nmarmene the supreme all-ruling world principle, with absolute \nauthority over even the gods. The Orphics said Ananke was mated to \nChronos (Time), which gave rise to the concept of supernatural \nduality known as Time-and-Fate. 1 It might be said there was no Greek \n\n\n\n28 \n\n\n\nidea of "God" that could transcend or overrule the feminine image of \nAnanke as the inescapable What-Must-Be. \n\n\n\n1. von Franz, 23. \n\n\n\nAnanta \nAnath \n\n\n\nAnanta \n\n"The Infinite," a great serpent in whose coils Hindu gods spent their \nperiods of sleep or death between periods of activity. 1 The serpent \nmight be compared to the ancient Egyptian goddess Mehen the \nEnveloper, a serpent who enfolded Ra every night when he was "dead" \nin the underworld. The sex of the eternal serpent was indeterminate. \nEarlier myths tended to see it as female, a cosmic Kundalini. Later \nVedic traditions tended to view Ananta as male. \n\nl.O\'Flaherty,221,340. \n\n\n\nAnastasia, Saint \n\n"She Who Stands in Heaven," title of Rome\'s Great Goddess, \npersonified as a pseudo-saint. Her three "serving-maids" Agapeta, \nTheonia, and Irene were originally the three Horae or Graces who \nattended the Goddess. \n\nHer Christianized legend associated Agapeta, Theonia, and Irene \nwith a man who suffered a ceremonial death in the same way as \nancient victims of the pagan Mamuralia or scapegoat-sacrifice. He was \nbeaten with rods, reviled and spat upon, then shown a vision of the \nTriple Goddess in his moment of death, whereupon he "fell into a sleep \nso deep" that no further blows could waken him. 1 \n\nHagiographers claimed Anastasia was another one of the "virgin \nmartyrs" slain by Diocletian\'s persecution. However, modern schol- \nars admit that she never existed except as a label on statues of the \nGoddess, which were re-interpreted as images of a saint. 2 Her holy \nday was the same as that of the sun\'s birth from the Great Mother at the \nwinter solstice: December 25. By the old lunar calendar, this festival \nbegan with its Eve, December 24, called Matrum Noctem, "Night of \nthe Mother." 3 \n\nl.deVoragine ( 52. 2. Attwater, 44. 3.

Greek- \nspeaking Phoenicians in Cyprus called her "Anat, Strength of Life." \nAn Egyptian stele of the time of Rameses II addressed her as Queen of \n\n\n\nvar. Anatha, Anat, \nNeit, or Ath-enna; \nEgyptian: Aynat \n\n\n\n29 \n\n\n\nAnath \n\n\n\nRas Shamra texts \n\nCuneiform tablets \ndiscovered in 1929 in \nthe Ras Shamra \nmound, northern Syria, \nsite of the ancient \nCanaanite capital city of \nUgarit. The texts \nreveal Canaanite \nfoundations of biblical \nmaterial. \n\n\n\nHeaven and Mistress of All the Gods. Under the Greek Ptolemaic \ndynasty she ruled both Egypt and Palestine. Semitic texts named her \nVirgin Daughter of Palestine, or Virgin Wisdom Dwelling in Zion. 1 \n\nThe Jerusalem temple was occupied for centuries by both God \n(El) and this Goddess, variously known as Queen of Heaven, Anat, \nAsherah, Mari, or Miriam. 2 Her sanctuary Beth-Anath (House of \nAnath) is mentioned in the 19th chapter of Joshua. Some early \nIsraelite chieftains called themselves her sons, like Shamgar ben Anath, \nwho "slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad" \n(Judges 3:3 1). The ox goad was a magic spell, represented by the letter \nlamedh, which means "ox goad." In Sicily, a Phoenician settlement \nwas named after this Goddess, Mach-Anath. Greeks called it Panorma, \nmeaning Universal Mountain Mother. 3 \n\nPrimitive sacrificial rites of Anath or Anat were described in the \nRas Shamra texts. She was fertilized by the blood of men, not by their \nsemen, because her worship dated all the way back to the Neolithic \nwhen fatherhood was unknown and blood was considered the only \nsubstance that could transmit life. Hecatombs of men seem to have \nbeen sacrificed to Anath when her image was reddened with "rouge \nand henna" for the occasion. 4 "Violently she smites and gloats, Anat \ncuts them down arid gazes; her liver exults in mirth ... for she \nplunges her knees in the blood of the soldiers, her loins in the gore of \nthe warriors, till she has had her fill of slaughtering in the house, of \ncleaving among the tables." 5 In similar rites in Egypt, priestesses hoisted \nup their skirts while dismembering the bull god Apis so his spurting \nblood would bathe their loins and fertilize them. 6 \n\nLike the Mexican "Lady of the Serpent Skirt," who made new life \nfrom Quetzalcoatl\'s genital blood, Anath hung the shorn penises of \nher victims on her goatskin apron, or aegis. 7 When the Goddess was \ntransplanted to Greece and permanently virginized as Athene, her \naegis was transformed from the ceremonial apron of Libyan priestesses \ninto a breastplate. 8 Athene still wore "serpents" (phalli) on her aegis, \nalong with the Gorgon head of her Destroyer aspect. Gorgon, "Grim \nOne," was Athene\'s title as a Death-goddess. 9 See Medusa; Metis; \nNeith. \n\nAnath annually cast her death-curse, anathema, on the Canaanite \ngod who became Lord of Death: Mot, the castrated "Sterility" aspect \nof the fertile Baal. Like Set in Egypt, Mot stood for the barren season \nthat slew its own fertile twin, the god Aleyin. In typical sacred-king \nstyle, Mot- Aleyin was the son of the Virgin Anath and also the \nbridegroom of his own mother. Like Jesus too, he was the Lamb of \nGod. He said, "I am Aleyin, son of Baal (the Lord). Make ready, then, \nthe sacrifice. I am the lamb which is made ready with pure wheat to \nbe sacrificed in expiation." 10 \n\nAfter Aleyin\'s death, Anath resurrected him and sacrificed Mot in \nturn. She told Mot that he was forsaken by his heavenly father El, the \nsame god who "forsook" Jesus on the cross. The words attributed to \n\n\n\n30 \n\n\n\nJesus, "My El, my El, why hast thou forsaken me? " (Mark 1 5:34), Anath \n\napparently were copied from the ancient liturgical formula, which \n\nbecame part of the Passover ritual at Jerusalem. \n\nThe sacred drama included a moment when Anath broke Mot\'s \nreed scepter, to signify his castration again foreshadowing a detail of \nthe Christian Gospels. The breaking of the scepter meant severing the \nconnection of the old, played-out king with the Earth-goddess after \nthe harvest of his reign. Anath therefore slew him and used his body and \nblood to refresh the soil for the next year\'s crop. "She seizes Mot, the \nson divine. With her sickle she cleaves him. With her flail she beats \nhim." His pieces were scattered on the fields, like pieces of the Savior \nOsiris in Egypt. 11 \n\nNaturally, the god-killing Anath was much diabolized in later \npatriarchal legends. Abyssinian Christians called her Aynat, "the evil \neye of the earth." They said she was an old witch destroyed by Jesus, \nwho commanded that she must be burned and her ashes scattered on \nthe wind. 12 The hostility of Jesus probably stemmed from the missionar- \nies\' deliberate reversal of his former identification with the destroyed \ngod. \n\nIn the Christian Gospels, Anath \'s death curse Anathema Mara- \nnatha (1 Corinthians 16:22) has been very loosely translated "the \nBridegroom cometh." It really meant the Bridegroom\'s imminent \ndeath; it was the solemn curse pronounced over any sacrificial \nvictim. 13 It carried the same double meaning as Latin sacer, meaning \nboth "holy" and "accursed" like all dying gods, who were formerly \nanathemata, "offerings." H Every nation has examples of gods chosen \nfor the sacred marriage, then accursed and killed. The Celtic God- \ndess\'s fatal words marked for death such heroes as Cu Chulainn and \nDiarmuid. The god called Lord of the Hunt became le Chasseur \nMaudit, "the Accursed Huntsman." \n\nThe origin of accursed heroes in general might be found in \nancient India, where Shiva the Condemned One was chosen by Sati- \nKali for the sacred marriage with her virgin incarnation, followed by his \ndeath and journey to the underworld. 15 As a personification of the \nPrimordial Abyss, the Goddess was sometimes called Kala-Nath, which \nmight have been related to the name of Anath. 16 \n\nAnath\'s capacity to curse and kill made even the Heavenly Father \nafraid of her. When El seemed reluctant to do her bidding, she \nthreatened to smash his head and cover his gray hair and beard with \ngore. He hastily gave her everything she asked, saying, "Whoever \nhinders thee will be crushed." 17 It was a long step from this Middle- \nEastern tale to the Greek concept of the dread Goddess as the \nHeavenly Father\'s ever-dutiful daughter.

In medieval Christian usage, to \nbe pronounced Anathema was to be cast out of the congregation with \nbell, book, and candle, and irrevocably consigned to hell: a curious \nreminiscence of the accursed god\'s temporary descent into the under- \nworld, in the ancient religion. \n\n\n\nX \n\n\n\nSt. Andrew\'s Cross \n\n\n\nAndrew, Saint \n\nFrom Greek andros, "man" or "virility," a title of the solar god of \nPatras, in Achaea, where the apostle Andrew was supposed to have \nbeen crucified after founding the Byzantine papacy. \' St. Andrew\'s \nlegend was invented by Byzantine bishops to counter Rome\'s claim to \nprimacy through its own legend of St. Peter. Eastern patriarchs \nupheld their magisterium by calling Andrew the elder brother of Peter, \nto enhance his authority, and declaring him the first apostle to \ndiscover the Messiah. 2 \n\nThe story that Andrew was crucified on an X-shaped cross, the \nso-called St. Andrew\'s Cross, was unknown until the Middle Ages. \nApparently it evolved from a popular symbol of the eastern patri- \narchs, a solar cross in an orb. 3 It was also the Cross of Wotan carried by \nNorse invaders into Scotland, where it became the present Scottish \nnational symbol. \n\nPatras, the site of Andrew\'s alleged martyrdom, was an old shrine \nof the phallic-solar father-god variously called Pater, Petra, or Peter, \nwhose name had the same basic meaning as Andrew. Political battles \nbetween the factions of Andrew and Peter in the 4th century a.d. \nstimulated canonical disguises for local genii loci in both Byzantium and \nRome, and these are still preserved in the calendar of saints. 4 \n\nl.Attwater,45. 2.

The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad said the Primal Andro- \ngyne was "of the same size and kind as man and woman closely \nembracing." 1 Some said the male and female elements lived together in \none skin, experiencing constant sexual bliss and spiritual \ncompleteness. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\n\nShiva and Shakti-Kali appeared as the androgyne Ardhanaris- Androgyne \n\nvara, the right side male, the left side female. 2 Rudra, the older form of \n\nShiva, was known as "the Lord Who is Half Woman." 3 Brahma ^_^__^^__ \n\nand Vishnu also appeared as bisexual beings united with their Shaktis. \nChinese Taoists held the mandala of Yang and Yin to represent the \nandrogyne. \n\nWestern myths also assigned androgyny to the elder gods or the \nfirst human beings. The Orphic creation myth said the firstborn deity \nwas a double-sexed Phanes or Eros, "Carnal Love," whose female half \nwas Psyche, the soul, Greek equivalent of Shakti. 4 Hermes owed his \nphenomenal wisdom to his former androgynous existence with Mother \nAphrodite, as double-sexed Hermaphroditus. 5 \n\nOften, the androgyne appeared in myth as male-female twins born \nsimultaneously, e.g. Isis-Osiris, Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, Fauna- \nFaunus, Helen-Helenus, or Artemis-Apollo, the "moon and sun" \nunited in their Mother\'s womb. Probably an androgynous image on \nApollo\'s altar at Delos gave rise to the story that he copulated with his \nsister Artemis on that altar. Several forms of the sun god were \nrepresented as requiring close physical union with the moon goddess, as \neven Brahma was useless without his female counterpart Bhavani, \n"Being." 6 Egypt\'s "supreme" sun god was often an androgyne; the sun \nwas his right eye, the moon his left. 7 The same androgynous being is \nstill worshipped in Dahomey as Nana-Buluku, Moon-Sun, who created \nthe world and gave birth to the first pair of human beings. 8 \n\nMany myths model the first human beings on the androgyne. \nPersians said the first pair in the garden of Heden (Eden) lived \ntogether in one body, until Ahura Mazda separated them. Jewish \nimitators of the Persians also said Adam and Eve were united in a \nbisexual body. Some rabbinical sources said Eve was not "taken out \nof" Adam; they were parted from one another by a jealous God who \nresented their sexual bliss, which was too Godlike for human beings, \nand should be reserved for deities. Casting man out of the "garden" \nmeant detaching him from the female body, often symbolized by the \nHebrew pardes, "garden." 9 This was another way of saying the \noriginal sin that angered God was not disobedience but sex. 10 \n\nGreek myths of the Golden Age told the same tale of a jealous \nGod: Zeus, who punished humanity\'s friend Prometheus with \neternal torture because he tricked the Heavenly Father for human- \nity\'s advantage (see Sacrifice). The people of the Golden Age had been \ncreated androgynous by Prometheus, who made their bodies of clay, \nand Athene, who gave them life. Father Zeus took out his anger on \nthem by tearing them apart. A piece of clay was torn out of the \nfemale part and stuck to the male part. That is why women have an \norifice that bleeds, and men have a loose dangling appendage that \nseems not to belong to them but always craves to return to the female \nbody it came from. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\n\nAndrogyne \n\n\n\nNaassenes, or \n\nNaassians; from \nHebrew nahash, "ser- \npent." Jewish or \nChristian Gnostic sects \nof the early Christian \nera, who worshipped \nthe serpent god \nOphis (Hermes) as a \nform of the Savior. \n\nMysteries General \nterm for religious rites \nof the "secret \ninitiation" type, which \nincluded early \nChristianity. \n\n\n\nCruel Zeus permitted human beings to return the male appendage \nto its female home sometimes, to sense for a brief moment the bliss of \ntheir former bisexual existence. Some Gnostic mystery cults of the first \ncenturies a.d. taught Tantric techniques to prolong the moment of \nbliss, which angered most forms of the Heavenly Father including the \nChristian one, whose bishops denounced this training as schooling \nin wickedness. 11 Church fathers especially deplored making or re- \nmaking the Beast with Two Backs, another term for the Primal \nAndrogyne. \n\nThough orthodox Christianity renounced both sexuality and an- \ndrogyny in religious images, Gnostic Christians used them. As Kali \nwas the female half of Shiva, so the Gnostic Great Mother Sophia was \nthe female half of Christ. This was revealed "in a great light": the \nSavior was shown as an androgyne coupled with "Sophia, Mother of \nAll." 12 \n\nGnostic Christians said those who received the true revelation of \nthe Father-Mother spirit were the only ones prepared for the secret \nsacrament called apolytrosis, "release," a concept identical with Tantric \nmoksha or "liberation." n Obviously influenced by Tantrism or its \nprototype, western Gnostics had made a direct translation of the Hindu \nYab-Yum, "Father-Mother," the sexual union of a sage and his \nShakti at the crucial moment of death. 14 Sexual sacraments were in \neffect practicing for that moment, when the enlightened one would \nbe restored to the condition of primordial bliss as an androgynous \ncreature. \n\nThe Naassenes said no enlightenment was possible without the \nFather-Mother spirit, an androgyne sometimes called Heavenly \nHorn of the Moon. 15 In the 5th century a.d., Orphic initiations sought \nto awaken a female spirit within man, to render him sensitive to the \nmessage of the Mysteries. After meeting the deities in a death-and- \nrebirth experience, he carried a bowl, emblem of the womb, and \ntouched his belly like a gravid woman, signifying "a spiritual experience \nuniting the opposed ways of knowledge of the male and female, and \nfused with this idea is that of a new life conceived within." 16 \n\nSuch Gnostic subtleties were disliked by the orthodox, who viewed \nall mergings of the sexes as unequivocally sinful. After Gnostic sects \nwere crushed, the androgyne was consigned to hell and gave birth to \nmany curious devils with both male and female attributes. A 1 6th- \ncentury book showed Satan himself seated on a throne, wearing a papal \ntiara, with bird feet, a female face in his genital area, and pendulous \nfemale breasts. 17 The Devil of the Tarot pack was usually androgynous, \nas were many of the devils represented in cathedral carvings. \n\n1.0\'Flaherty,34. 2.

Perseus seems to have been a Greek name for Baal in this \n\nmyth, for Baal annually fought Yamm for the love of Mother Astarte, \n\nthe Philistines\' Goddess, locally named Atargatis. Baal replaced \n\nYamm, then was himself replaced when the queen tired of him and he \n\nbecame Yamm in his turn. Andromeda on her rock, in the classic \n\nmyth, was transformed from a critical observer of the combat into a \n\nvictim. \n\nThat Perseus played the role of sacred king in the original myth \nis shown by his apotheosis and rising to dwell in the stars. So also \nHeracles was raised to the stars after performing the same feat \nslaying the great sea serpent in order to mate with Hesione, "Queen of \nAsia," probably just another name for Andromeda-Atargatis. 1 \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,224. \n\n\n\nAndrophonos \n\n"Man-slayer," title of the Goddess Aphrodite as a Destroyer or \ndeath-goddess. She was also the Black One, the Goddess of the Tombs, \nand the Queen Bee who killed her lovers as drone bees are killed, by \ncastration and evisceration. She had "many titles which seem inconsist- \nent with her beauty and complaisance." \' That was because classic \nmythographers sought to make her a love goddess only, ignoring her \nearlier character as the creating-and-destroying Triple Goddess (see \nTrinity). \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,71-72. \n\n\n\nAngels \n\nThe earliest angels were heavenly nymphs, like Hindu apsaras, who \ndispensed sensual bliss to the blessed ones. Vikings called them \nValkyries. Greeks called them Horae. Persians called them Houris, or \nPeris (fairies). A guardian angel was a personal Shakti who watched \nover a man and took him into her ecstatic embrace at the moment \nof death. N \n\nHindu angels were created primarily for lovemaking. They had no \nmenstruation, pregnancy, birth, or nursing, though they were moth- \ners. Each child appeared miraculously on its mother\'s knee at the age of \nfive years. Apsaras could copulate endlessly with gods without any \nemission of fluids or loss of energy. Such a being was "the perfect \ndispenser of sensual delight and amorous bliss on a divine scale." 1 \nLike the queen of the Holy Grail palace in bardic romance, the angel \nwas a "Dispenser of Joy." (See Grail, Holy.) \n\n\n\n35 \n\n\n\nAngerona \n\n\n\nMagic Papyri \n\nCollections of \nexorcisms, invocations, \ncharms, and spells \nwidely circulated during \nthe early Christian \nera, used as bases for \nlater grimoires and \nHermetic texts. \n\n\n\nThere were earthy angels too, the dakinis, "Skywalkers." Tantric \nwritings said they lived in the Palace of Lotus Light. They were \nsometimes called prostitutes\' daughters, or yoginis, i.e., yoga- \npriestesses. 2 \n\nAlthough such angels seemed to be every man\'s wish fulfillment, \npatriarchal religions denied the sexuality of angels. Moslems rejected \nthe Houris (heavenly "whores"), and insisted the angels are without \ncarnal desires. 3 Yet this contradicted the teaching of the Koran, that \nafter death every hero would receive beautiful girls as heavenly \ncompanions. 4 \n\nEuropean Christianity consigned the formerly divine Horae to \nFairyland, the earthly paradise distinguished from the celestial one. \nThe place was called locus voluptatis terrestis, the Terrestrial Place of \nPleasure, or pratum felicitatus, the Paradise of Joy. 5 \n\nAngels were often confused with seraphs and cherubs. The former \nwere six-winged fiery flying serpents, the lightning-spirits of Chalde- \nan myth. The latter were Semitic kerubh, from Sheban mu-karrib, \n"priests of the moon"; sometimes they could take the form of birds. \nAngels accompanying the Hindu Great Goddess were able to fly on the \nwings of garuda birds. 6 \n\nBiblical angels were "sons of God" who came to earth to beget \nchildren on mortal women (Genesis 6:4). Later these were called \ndemons, or incubi, or "fallen" angels. The Book of Enoch blamed \nwomen for the angels\' fall. Women had "led astray the angels of \nheaven." 7 In the Magic Papryi, the words angel, spirit, god, and demon \nwere interchangeable. 8 When St. Paul said women\'s heads must be \ncovered in church "because of the angels" (1 Corinthians 1 1:10), he \nmeant the daemones (demons) supposed to be attracted to women\'s \nhair. The Greeks thought each person had an individual guardian angel \nor daemon which could appear in animal form, and under Christian- \nity evolved into the "familiar spirit." There were no really well-defined \ndistinctions between angels, demons, familiars, fairies, elves, saints, \ngenii, ancestral ghosts, or pagan gods. 9 Among supernatural beings one \nmight always find many hazy areas of overlapping identities, even \n"good" or "evil" qualities being blurred. \n\nA Gallup poll showed in 1978 that over half of all Americans still \nbelieve in angels. 10 \n\n1.

Some said Angerona represented the secret name of Rome, \nwhich it was illegal to pronounce. 1 In all probability she was a pre- \n\n\n\n36 \n\n\n\nRoman title of the same primal Creatress whom Gnostics called Sige, \n"Silence," personifying the lightless and soundless womb that gave \nbirth to the first deities. Gnostics said Silence was the mother of the \nGreat Goddess herself. \n\n1. Larousse, 214. \n\n\n\nAngurboda \nAnkamma \n\n\n\nAngurboda \n\nEddaic "Hag of the Iron Wood," mother of Hel and of the Moon- \ndogs who bore away the dead. Danaans, or Danes, knew her as Anu, \nYngona, Nanna, or "Anna of the Angles." She was a "hag" in the \nancient sense of "Holy One"; the Death-goddess. 1 See Dog. \n\n1. Graves, W.G, 409. \n\n\n\nAnima \n\nFemale soul, from the roots an, "heavenly," and ma, "mother," \nrecalling a time when all souls were supposed to emanate from the \nHeavenly Mother. 1 In the 16th century a.d. Guillaume Postel said \nevery soul had male and female halves, the animus and anima. The \nmale half had been redeemed by Christ, but the female half was still \nunredeemed and awaited a female savior. 2 This was a new development \nof the old Christian view that only males had any souls at all. The \nthird canon of the Council of Nantes in 660 a.d. had decided that all \nwomen are "soulless brutes." 5 \n\nAlchemists applied the word anima to all "spirits" considered \nfemale: Anima Mercury, Anima Mundi, etc. The Spirit of the World \nwas connected with the elements of earth and water, like Eleusinian \nDemeter, "Mistress of Earth and Sea." One reason alchemists were \nsuspected of heresy was their notion that the World-Soul was a female \nanima. \n\nCarl Jung revived the terms animus and anima to describe reason- \ning and intuitive parts of the mind (i.e., left and right hemispheres). \nEvery person\'s anima is "often symbolically connected with both earth \nand water. She is pictured as timeless and profoundly wise. . . . Each \nman\'s first and formative experience of the anima is with his mother. \nHer true function in the mind, according to Jung, is creativity." 4 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 410. 2.

Its other name \nwas Key of the Nile, because the sacred marriage between God and \nGoddess was supposed to take place at the source of the Nile each year \nbefore the flood. The Christian version of the Cross of Life, which \ndidn\'t appear in Christian art until after the 5th century a.d., sig- \nnificantly lacked the feminine oval and kept only the masculine part \nof the figure. 1 \n\nThe ankh seems to have evolved from an ancient symbol of the \nGoddess in Libya and Phoenicia: a narrow triangle surmounted by \na crossbar and a round or oval head. 2 \n\nt Egyptians regarded the ankh as a universal life-charm. "The life of \n\nevery being, divine or human, depended on his or her possession of \nit. From first to last the gods are seen carrying it in their right hands, and \nthey gave life to their kings and servants presenting it to them." 3 \nEarly Christians also used the ankh occasionally as an emblem of \n\nimmortality, calling it an ansated cross. They knew the Egyptians had \n\nAnkh a certain letter-hieroglyph that "stood for the life to come; and this letter \n\nhad the form of a cross." 4 In hieroglyphics the ankh stood simply for \nthe word "life." 5 \n\nI.

The name meant Lady of Heaven. See Anne, Saint. \n\n\n\nAnnapurna \n\nHimalayan mountain called Great Breast Full of Nourishment; a \nmanifestation of the Great Goddess as the home and support of the \ngods. \n\n\n\nAnne, Saint \n\nMythical mother of the virgin Mary, from the Middle-Eastern \nGoddess Anna, or Hannah, or Di-Ana, mother of Mari. From Sumeria \nto pre-Roman Latium she was known as Anna, the Grandmother- \nGoddess; Anatha in Syria, Anat in Canaan, Ana or Anah in several Old \nTestament transformations. Long before the Bible was written, the \nGoddess Anna was already known as the Grandmother of God. Hence, \n\n\n\n38 \n\n\n\nthe choice of her name for the mother of God\'s Mother is hardly Anne, Saint \n\nsurprising. 1 \n\nSyriac versions of the Book of James said God\'s Grandmother was ^^^^^^^^ \nnot Anna but Dinah, actually the same name, a Semitic Di-Ana or \n"Goddess Ana." Dinah was the ancestress of Dinaite tribes who settled \nin Sumeria (Ezra 4:9). As Anatha, she was the consort of Yahweh at \nElephantine. 2 As Anna Perenna she was Grandmother Time to the \nRomans, mother of the Aeons. As Ana or Anu she ruled Celtic \ntribes. As Nanna, she was an incarnation of Freya in the mother-bride of \nBalder. In Phrygia too, she was Nana, mother of the Savior. She was \nreally as old as the oldest civilization. A Sumerian prayer declared: \n"Hear O ye regions, the praise of Queen Nana; magnify the \nCreatress, exalt the dignified, exalt the Glorious One, draw nigh unto \nthe Mighty Lady." 3 \n\nRomans worshipped the Goddess as Anna Perenna, "Eternal \nAnna," mother of the Aeons. She stood at the change of years, a two- \nheaded Goddess of Time with two faces named Prorsa and Postverta, \nlooking forward and backward from her heavenly gate among the \nstars, where one celestial cycle merged into the next. So she stood for \nboth Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. Under the name of \nCarmenta she invented all the letters in between. 4 She was also Jana, or \nJuno, mother of the January New Year. Classical myths masculin- \nized her as the two-faced Janus, god of gateways. Christians may have \nconfused icons labeled IANA with the mother of the Virgin; for Jana- \nJuno was the virgin mother of the savior-god Mars. \n\nOvid said Anna was the same as the Moon-goddess Minerva. \nSappho named her "the Queen." 5 To the Celts, she was the same as \ntheir Ana, first of the female trinity of the Morrigan, associated with the \nCauldron of Regeneration. Her moon-temple used to stand at Cnoc \nAine in Limerick, now a shrine of "St. Anne." 6 To Irish pagans, Ana \nmeant "mother." It also came to mean wealth, plenty, treasure. 7 \n\nAs Grandmother-goddess, Ana could be a destroying Crone. \nSome myths called her Morg-ana, "Invincible Queen Death." Medi- \neval Christians called her Anna of the Angles, or Black Annis, or \nAngurboda, the Hag of the Iron Wood, mother of Hel. 8 The magic \npentacle was the sign of Morg-ana. 9 A similar five-pointed star stood for \nthe underworld in Egyptian hieroglyphics. 10 This same star was the \nofficial sigil of St. Anne. 11 \n\nIn her Christianized form, Anne had three husbands, gave birth to \nmany saints, and became the patron of midwives and miners. Neu- \nmann says, "All this bears witness to her original fertility aspect as Earth \nMother." n \n\nSt. Anne was of crucial importance in the dogma of the virgin \nMary\'s immaculate conception, adopted as an article of faith in \n1854, after seven centuries of controversy. 13 In the official Catholic \nview, original sin was transmitted by sexual acts. Therefore, so Mary \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\n\nAntic Hey \nAntichrist \n\n\n\nJohannes Trithemius \n\n15th-century \nGerman scholar, Abbot \nof Sponheim \n\n\n\ncould be born without taint of original sin, St. Anne herself had to be in- \nnocent of sexuality. Accordingly, Johannes Trithemius proclaimed \nthat Anne "was chosen by God for her appointed services before the \nfoundation of the world. She conceived \'without the action of man,\' \nand was as pure as her daughter." H \n\nAt first the church accepted this doctrine, because it seemed to \nsolve the problem of Mary\'s sinlessness. Later it was rejected. Two \nvirgin births made one too many. In the end, St. Anne was said to have \nconceived Mary in the normal way but the child was freed in the \nwomb of original sin. Though these intimate matters are supposed to be \nknown in minute detail, churchmen incongruously admit that "noth- \ning whatever is known about the parents of the Virgin Mary." 15 \n\n1.

Carnival "antics" were connected with \nthe Old Religions, whose sacred processions were often accompanied \nby clowns deliberately making obscene gestures and jokes to heighten \nthe spirit of revelry. 1 The "hey" was, and is, a figure-eight pattern \npaced on the ground, the sign meaning "infinity" in Hindu-Arabic \nnumeral systems and in their descendant, modern mathematics. \nChoruses of old folk songs call for the hey, in nonsense phrases like \n"Hey, nonny nonny," or "Hey, deny down." Thus the antic hey was \nreally a pagan liturgy in song or dance or both, performed at secularized \nversions of the ancient rites. \n1. Funk, p. 54. \n\n\n\nAntichrist \n\nVirgin-born son of the devil, supposed to appear during the world\'s \nLast Days. Christianity never escaped the patterns of dualism, whereby \neach god had to have an equal and opposite anti-god. Antichrist was \nthe Christian equivalent of Chaldean Aciel, lord of the nether world, \ncounterbalancing the solar god of the heavens. \n\nThe coming of Antichrist has been announced and re-announced \nthroughout the entire Christian era, especially in times of political \nand social stress. His title has been laid on Nero, Attila, Genghis Khan, \nMerlin, Frederick II, and many others including several popes. More \nrecently, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, and Hitler were all nominated for \nthe position. See Doomsday. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n\n\nAntinomianism \n\nGeneral term for Christian sects that followed the original doctrine of \napotheosis, believing they could become "one with Christ." Like their \npagan contemporaries, many early Christians thought the only route \nto immortality was deification, and the object of their Mysteries was to \nlearn how to be deified. The distinction between men and gods was \nthat men died and gods didn\'t. Thus, one\'s immortality depended on \nbecoming a god, often by sacramental procedures such as eating a \ngod\'s flesh and blood (see Cannibalism). \n\nClement of Alexandria said: "That man with whom the Logos \n\ndwells ... is made like God and is beautiful [T]hat man becomes \n\nGod, for God so wills it [T]he Logos of God became man that from \n\nman you might learn how man may become God. . . . [T]he true \nChristian Gnostic has already become God." l \n\nThis doctrine of deification was soundly based on pagan prece- \ndent. Worshippers of Hermes the Logos believed that "This is the \ngood end for those who have attained knowledge, namely, Deification." \nThey said to Hermes, "Thou art I, and I am thou; thy name is mine, \nfor I am thy image (eidolon)." Mithraists used the same formula, "I am \nthou and thou art I," which the Gospels put in the mouth of Jesus, \n"Abide in me, and I in you" (John 1 5:4). Seneca said, "A holy spirit \ndwells within us." Epictetus wrote: "You are bearing a God with \nyou. ... It is within yourself that you carry him." Cicero said initiation \ninto the Mysteries taught a man he could be God, "inferior in no \nwhit to the celestials." 2 \n\nThe theological pitfall in the concept of salvation through apotheo- \nsis was that identification of self and god led to what Tantric sages \ncalled Svecchacara, "Do As You Will." In effect, the perfected sage \ncould do nothing evil because he was God, and God was incapable of \nsinning. 3 Therefore he was above all man-made laws, and could do \nas he pleased. \n\nGreek democracy was based on a related idea that through \nenlightenment and reason each citizen would become capable of self- \ngovernment and would make no moral errors. This did not apply to \nslaves, women, or those who owned no property; such were not \nclassed as citizens. Mature male landowners however could become \nidiotae, "self-gods." 4 Thus the word "idiot" began in Greek with the \nsense of "one who will not be governed," that is, one who believed the \ndivine will dwelt in himself. \n\nNumerous medieval Christian sects took the Antinomian route to \nsalvation, believing that, like eastern sages, they could become one \nwith the divine. These mystics "in their identification with God sup- \nposed that upon their conscious union with Him they were exempt \nfrom the rules governing ordinary men." Leaders like Amalric of Bena, \nJohann Hartmann, sects like the Alumbrados, Illuminates, Adamites, \nand others taught that when their flesh was occupied by the holy spirit \n\n\n\nAntinomianism \n\n\n\nClement of \nAlexandria (Titus \nFlavius Clemens) \nChristian presbyter and \nteacher of the late \n2nd century a.d., once \nreckoned a saint, but \nremoved from the \ncanon of saints in \n1586 by Pope SixtusV. \n\nAlumbrados, \n\n"Enlightened Ones" \nSpanish heretics of \nthe 15th to 17th \ncenturies, recruited \nfrom reform \nmovements among \nthe Jesuits and \nFranciscans. They \nwere eventually \nexterminated by the \nInquisition. \n\nIlluminati or \n\n"Perfectibilists" \nBavarian secret \nsociety founded by \nAdam Weishaupt, a \nformer Jesuit. The \nsociety was banned \nin 1785. \n\nAdamites 18th- \ncentury sectaries who \nbelieved nakedness \nrepresented the natural \nstate of innocence in \nwhich Adam dwelt \nbefore he "fell" into \nsin, and began to clothe \nhimself. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n\n\nAnubis they could commit no sins of the flesh. For them, sexual promiscuity \n\nwas only a natural "embracing of God." 5 \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Brothers and Sisters of the Free Spirit undertook to demonstrate \n\nthe redemptive virtues of sexuality, nakedness, and scorn of the \nconventions. The more openly they displayed their hippie-like beha- \nviors, the more closely they approached the divine essence. Frazer \nremarked, "Their progress toward this mystic communion was acceler- \nated by the Inquisition, and they expired in the flames, not merely \nwith unclouded serenity, but with the most triumphant feelings of \ncheerfulness and joy." 6 They had their own martyr, a literary sister \nwho wrote the gospel of their sect, The Mirror of Free Souls. She and \nher book both were excommunicated and burned in 1 3 10 a.d. 7 \n\nAntinomian ideas were often defined as heresy, as in the case of \nSimon Morin, who seems to have had fairly standard delusions of \ngrandeur. He said he was the incarnate second coming of Christ, and \nwas incapable of committing a sin; anything he did must be wor- \nshipped. The church disagreed, and burned him as a witch. 8 \n\nThe usual Antinomian excuses for sexual self-expression infiltrated \na group of nuns in the Dominican convent of St. Catherine de Prato. \nEarly in the 19th century, a text of the official inquiry into this case was \npublished in Brussels, then "withdrawn at the insistence of the Papal \nCourt. The second edition is . . . much expurgated." One of the nuns \nexpounded on her Antinomian teachings: "It is sufficient to elevate \nthe spirit to God and then no action, whatever it be, is sinful. . . . Love \nof God and one\'s neighbor is the whole of the commandments. Man \nwho unites with God by means of woman satisfies both command- \nments. So also does he who, lifting his spirit to God, has enjoyment \nwith a person of the same sex or alone. ... In doing that which we \nerroneously call impure is real purity ordained by God, without \nwhich man cannot arrive at a knowledge of Him." 9 \n\nSuch ideas were typically Oriental, as opposed to the Christian idea \n\nof entering into a relationship with a God who was an external \n\n"other." Though the Gospels said "the kingdom of God is within you" \n\n(Luke 17:21), orthodox Christianity treated this as a heretical idea. 10 \n\n1. Angus, 106. 2. Angus, 102, 108, 1 10, 1 12. 3.

Mated to Nephthys, the underground aspect of Isis, Anubis \nwas sometimes known as the Great Dog. He was considered essential to \nthe worship of Isis and Osiris. Plutarch said he had "a power among \n\n\n\n42 \n\n\n\nthe Egyptians much like that of Hecate among the Greeks, he being ter- \nrestrial as well as Olympic Those that worship the dog, have a \n\ncertain secret meaning that must not be revealed.

Her symbol was the cowrie, always emblematic of \nfemale genitals. Her union with the ithyphallic god was supposed to \nbring life-giving Nile waters to the land. She "clasped" a number of \ngods, including in the 5 th century b.c. the Hebrew Jehovah. 1 \n\nLike Kali Ma in India, Anuket had four arms, representing union \nbetween male and female principles. The general pattern for such \ndeities was that two arms held symbols of the male elements, and two \nheld symbols of the female elements. Yet she was known as "The \nOne." She was "self-begotten and self-produced, and whilst yet a virgin \ngave birth to the sun god." 2 \n\nAt the Festival of the Inundation, Egyptians sang to her: "Thou \nart the bringer of food, thou art the mighty one of meat and drink, \nthou art the creator of all good things. Thou fillest the storehouses; thou \nheapest high with corn the granaries, and thou hast care for the poor \nand needy." 3 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 405; Lamusse, 37. 2. Budge, D.N., 159. 3.

However, the Serpent was a common \npersonification of the Egyptian underworld or Tuat itself. The realm \nof darkness with its various "chambers" was the interior of the serpent\'s \nbody, through which the sun god must pass, as he was always \nswallowed at each sunset. 1 \n\nIn medieval alchemy the "Apophis-snake" was confused with the \nHermetic Ouroboros, a hidden world spirit in the form of a serpent, \nwho might reveal the secret of the Philosopher\'s Stone. \n\n1.

It has been shown that "In the symbolism of dreams and of \nmyths the hat is usually the phallus." 2 \n\nThe Flamen\'s wife, the Flaminica, represented the Goddess. She \nwas the more important dignitary of the two. If his marriage was \nterminated by her death, the Flamen immediately lost his sacred office \nand reverted to a private citizen. Such customs show that the powers \nof priests "in Rome as elsewhere, derived in the first instance from an \nolder priesthood of magical women." 3 \n\nThe same conical cap belonged to the Lord of the Underworld in \nCeltiberian pagan imagery. He was Helman: a man belonging to the \nGoddess Hel. 4 Sometimes he was said to be the god Frey, consort of \nHel\'s heavenly or lunar aspect, Freya. 5 \n\nThe same conical cap evolved into the traditional headdress of sor- \ncerers and witches; the Fool\'s Cap (or Dunce Cap) worn by the \nCarnival King; the bishop\'s miter; the pope\'s tiara; and before them all, \nthe conical crown of Egyptian pharaohs, emblem of the king\'s union \nwith the Sky-goddess.

Like Kali, she was a Virgin-Mother-Crone \ntrinity. She was once indistinguishable from the Fates (Moirai); her \nold name was Moira, and she was said to be older than Time. She gov- \nerned the world by ius naturale, the natural law of the maternal clan. 1 \n\nShe was not only Greek. She was the Dea Syria, also known as \nAsherah or Astarte, Goddess of the oldest continuously-occupied \ntemple in the world. 2 She was the ancestral mother of the Romans, for \nshe gave birth to their founding father, Aeneas. 3 Under the name of \nVenus, she was the mother of the Venetii, whose capital city became \nVenice, called "Queen of the Sea" after the Goddess herself. \n\nOne of Aphrodite\'s major centers of worship was the city of \nPaphos on Cyprus, the island named for its copper mines. Thus, she \nwas called "the Cyprian" or "the Paphian," and her sacred metal was \ncopper. She was also called Mari, the Sea. Egyptians referred to her \nisland as Ay-Mari. 4 \n\nDuring the Christian era, Aphrodite\'s temple on Cyprus was \nconverted into a sanctuary of the virgin Mary, another name of the \nsame Goddess, but in this sanctuary the virgin Mary is hailed to this day \nas Panaghia Aphroditessa, "All-holy Aphrodite." 5 \n\n\n\n44 \n\n\n\nContinued worship of the goddess on Cyprus probably contributed Apis \n\nto the Christian belief that the whole population of Cyprus descend- \ned from demons. 6 In reality, Cyprian Aphrodite was like all other ^^^^^^^^ \nmanifestations of the Great Goddess: ruling birth, life, love, death \ntime, and fate, reconciling man to all of them through sensual and \nsexual mysticism. The Cyprian sage Zenon taught Aphrodite\'s phi- \nlosophy: "mankind and the universe were bound together in the system \n\nof fate Diogenes Laertios tells us that Zenon was the first to \n\ndefine the end of human existence as \'life in accordance with nature.\' " 7 \n\nAphrodite had almost as many "emanations" as Thousand-Named \nKali. She was not only Mari and Moira and Marina and Pelagia and \nStella Maris, all titles related to her control of the sea; she was also \nIlithyia, Goddess of childbirth; Hymen, Goddess of marriage; Venus, \nGoddess of sexuality and the hunt; Urania, Queen of Heaven; Andro- \nphonos, the Destroyer of Men; and many others. She was often \nidentified with Isis. Anchises, her lover who begot Aeneas and then was \ncastrated, had a name meaning "he who mates with Isis." 8 Under \nseveral of her names, Aphrodite mated with Semitic gods. Her cult \noccupied the main temple in Jerusalem after 70 a.d. In the 4th \ncentury it was said that Constantine\'s mother found the true cross of \nChrist buried in Aphrodite\'s Jerusalem temple. (See Cross.) \n\nOne of Aphrodite\'s greatest shrines in Asia Minor was the city of \nAphrodisias, once dedicated to Ishtar. Up to the 12th century a.d., \nwhen the city was taken by Seljuk Turks, the Goddess was worshipped \nthere as the patron of arts and letters, crafts, and culture. 9 Recent \nexcavations have uncovered exquisite artifacts and statuary, bespeaking \na cultivated and sophisticated lifestyle under the Goddess\'s rule. 10 \n\nThe calendar still keeps the name of Aphrodite on the month \ndedicated to her, April (Aphrilis). The ancient Kalendar of Romulus \nsaid this was the month of Venus. 11 \n\n1. Bachofen, 57, 192. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Byblos." 3. Graves, G.M. 1, 69. \n4. Graves, W.G., 410. 5. Ashe, 192. 6.

Apis was begotten in bull form when moon- \nbeams fell on a cow in heat. He was identified by special markings, \nnotably symbols of the Goddess: a triangle on his forehead, a flying \nvulture on his side, a crescent moon on his flank. After death each Apis \nbull was elaborately embalmed and buried in the vast underground \nbull-tombs. 1 In mummy form, like all Egyptian gods, he became "an \nOsiris." \n\n\n\n1 . Larousse, 44. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n45 \n\n\n\nApollo Apollo \n\nGreek sun god who took over the powers of his twin sister Artemis, \n^^^^^^^^^^^ the Moon. Originally, he was her child, as the sun was born of \n\nthe Moon-goddess in Egypt and elsewhere. He was also her totemic \nbeast in several forms: a wolf (Apollo Lycaeus), a mouse (Apollo \nSmintheus), or a golden-maned lion (Apollo Chrysocomes). \n\nThe fully anthropomorphized Apollo laid claim to the Goddess\'s \npowers of prophecy, poetry, music, magic, and healing. His priest- \nhood adopted the Muses, the Graces, even the Great Serpent who gave \noracles from the earth-womb, Apollo Python, known as Sol Niger \n(Black Sun) during his nightly sojourn in the underworld. Egyptians \ncalled him Apep or Apophis, the serpent of darkness. In the Bible he \nis Apollyon, "Spirit of the Pit" (Revelation 9:1 1). \n\nApollo\'s serpent-form inspired the Pythoness, priestess of the \nDelphic oracle, Greece\'s foremost temple of prophecy. This temple \nbelonged to the Goddess in the beginning; delphi means womb. Even \nApollo\'s priests admitted that she had owned the oracle in her \ntrinitarian guise as mother of earth, heaven, and the abyss: the first of all \ndeities to prophesy, the Earth-mother; and Themis, mother of the sea \nand of all Themistes, "oracles"; and the Moon-goddess, Artemis, under \nthe name of Phoebe another title stolen by Apollo, who became \nknown as Phoebus. 1 \n\nApollonian priests naturally directed their energies toward con- \nquest of the oracles. "The reason why a deity associated with political \nconquest and order should take possession of oracular shrines is obvious; \noracles were the chief means of controlling public opinion and public \naction, and to control the oracles was as necessary to a political god as it \nis to later politicians to control the press or education." 2 \n\nLaurel became Apollo\'s sacred plant because it was the plant of \ninspired poetic frenzy, which is why Britain\'s national poet is still \ncalled Laureate, the laurel-crowned one. The Delphic Pythoness \nchewed leaves of cherry laurel to induce her poetic-prophetic trances. \nCherry laurel contains traces of cyanide, enough to cause delirium, \nfoaming at the mouth, and other symptoms of divine possession. \n\nApollo\'s priests used the oracles to create new patriarchal laws, \noverturning the laws of the matriarchate. Apollo\'s most notable \njudicial act was to absolve Orestes from the crime of killing his mother. \nApollo said it was no crime, because a mother is not a real parent; \nonly a father truly gives life to a child, the same "Apollonian" opinion \nlater adopted by Christian theologians. 3 Yet this patriarchal opinion \nwas negated by Apollo\'s own surname of Letoides, "son of Leto." 4 He \ncarried the name of his mother only, after the custom of the matri- \narchal Lycians who recognized strictly matrilineal ancestry, and in \nwhose country Apollo\'s cult first evolved. \n\nIn his earliest manifestations, Apollo was subordinate to the God- \ndess as her dog-faced or wolf-faced door-guardian: a "Spirit of the \nPit" like Apollyon, another name for Anubis or Cerberus. Four Hittite \n\n\n\n46 \n\n\n\naltars found in Anatolia were dedicated to a god named Apulunas, \nGuardian of Gates, forerunner of Apollo Lycaeus or "Wolfish Apol- \nlo." 5 Once he walked at the Goddess\'s heel, like Anubis; but this \nwas suppressed and forgotten. \n\nTo some early Christians, Apollo became a junior God. He was \neven said to have fathered on mortal virgins several pagan sages \nrespected by the church, such as Plato. 6 Healing miracles were widely \nattributed to Apollo. 7 Christians sought his intervention in certain \nillnesses. It was claimed that if a naked virgin touched the afflicted part, \nsaying, "Apollo denieth that the heat of the plague can increase \nwhere a naked virgin quencheth it," the patient would get well. 8 \n\nUnder his title of Benedictus, "Good-speaker," Apollo was even \ncanonized, and became St. Benedict. 9 \n\n1.

When he went through the streets, the people came forth \nto worship him, and every one brought him an alms, with children and \nsick folks, that he might cure them, and bless them, suffering him to do all \nthings at his pleasure, only he was accompanied with ten or twelve men \nlest he should fly. . . . The feast being come, and he grown fat, they killed \nhim, opened him, and ate him, making a solemn sacrifice of him. \' \n\nThis devoured Savior, closely watched by his ten or twelve \nguards, embodied the god Quetzalcoatl, who was born of a virgin, slain \nin atonement for a primal sin, and whose Second Coming was \nconfidently expected. 2 He was often represented as a trinity signified by \nthree crosses, a large one between the smaller ones. 5 Father Acosta \nnaively said, "It is strange that the devil after his manner hath brought a \nTrinity into idolatry." 4 His church found it all too familiar, and long \nkept his book as one of its secrets. \n\nThe Gospels contain hints that Jesus was as reluctant as the \nQuetzalcoatl-victim. Once he ran away from his "apostles" and fled \nalone into the mountains, fearing men would "come and take him by \nforce, to make him a king" (John 6:1 5). That is, he didn\'t want the \nfatal honor of being a sacred king of the Jews, the doomed Bridegroom \nof Zion. The apostles caught up with him in Capernaum, and his \nsubsequent speeches indicate resignation to his fate. \n\nHe said he was the bread of God, come down from heaven to give \nlife to the world: "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will \ngive for the life of the world Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh \n\n\n\nJose de Acosta \n\n16th-century Spanish \nJesuit missionary who \naccompanied the \nconquistadores, and \nwrote a history of \nnative cultures in Peru, \nBolivia, and Mexico. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\nApotheosis my blood, hath eternal life" (John 6:50, 54). On the eve of the \n\nApple sacrifice he prayed despairingly, "O my Father, if it be possible, let \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ this cup pass from me; nevertheless . . . thy will be done" (Matthew \n26:39, 42). At least the Gospel narrator claims Jesus said this. \n\nNaturally, any sacred king\'s guards would become popularizers of \nhis cult, "dining out" on the divine sayings and actions for years. \nHowever, the Gospels were not written by the apostles whose names \nthey bear. They were forgeries, compiled long after Jesus\'s time, \nsome as late as the middle of the 2nd century. 5 Even this is scholarly \nguesswork, since no authentic manuscript can be dated before the 4th \ncentury. 6 \n\nCanonization of the apostles used an ancient Buddhist symbol, the \nushnisha or "flame of invisible light" appearing on top of their heads. \nTo Buddhists, this flame streaming from the "lotus center" of the skull \nmeant super-intelligence. It appeared over the heads of bodhisattvas. 7 \nThe same phenomenon appeared over the heads of the apostles (Acts \n2:4). The rest of their stories were as mythical as those of the \nbodhisattvas. Guignebert says "not one of them is true. . . . [Tjhere \nexists no information really worthy of credence about the life and \nwork of the immediate Apostles of Jesus." 8 \n\nl.Frazer,G.B.,680. 2.

It became a custom to apotheosize Roman emperors while \nthey were still living. Most other ancient kings were also gods on earth. \nTheir surrogates, the "sacred kings" who died in their place, were \npromised immediate godhood after death. \n\nApotheosis was similarly promised Christian martyrs who perished \nin the belief that they would be wholly assimilated to Christ and \nwould sit "on the right hand of God" like him. The church\'s ritual of \ncanonization was a direct copy of pagan ceremonies of apotheosis. \nThe Roman emperors\' souls winging to heaven as eagles contributed \nthe idea of releasing white doves at the climax of the church\'s \ncanonization ceremony. 1 See Drama. \n\nl.Gaster,769. \n\n\n\nApple \n\nEve\'s fruit of knowledge used to be the Goddess\'s sacred heart of \nimmortality, all over the Indo-European culture complex. The God- \ndess\'s many western paradises grew the apples of eternal life. The \n\n\n\n48 \n\n\n\nCelts called the western paradise Avalon, "Apple-land," a country ruled Apple \n\nby Morgan, the queen of the dead. Irish kings received the Goddess\'s \n\nmagic apples of immortality and went away to live with her under the ^^^^^_^_^^ \n\nsunset. King Arthur was taken to Avalon by the Triple Goddess in \n\nperson, as three fairy queens. \n\nScandinavians thought apples essential to resurrection, and placed \nvessels of them in graves. 1 The Norse Goddess Idun kept the magic \napple-land in the west, where the gods received the fruit that kept them \ndeathless. 2 Apples carried souls from one body to the next. Sigurd\'s \nor Siegfried\'s great-grandmother conceived by eating an apple. 3 The \nYule pig was roasted with an apple in its mouth, to serve as a heart in \nthe next life (see Boar). \n\nGreeks said Mother Hera kept the magic apple garden in the west, \nwhere the Tree of Life was guarded by her sacred serpent. Graves \npoints out that the whole story of Eve, Adam, and the serpent in the \ntree was deliberately misinterpreted from icons showing the Great \nGoddess offering life to her worshipper, in the form of an apple, with \nthe tree and its serpent in the background. Similarly, Hellenes \nmisinterpreted icons of the hero-victim receiving an apple from the \nTriple Goddess, before his journey to paradise, as the Judgment \nof Paris: a picture of a young man receiving the apple from three \nGoddesses, not vice versa. 4 \n\nRomans gave the apple-mother the name of Pomona, which was \nprobably inherited from the Etruscans. She symbolized all fruition. A \nRoman banquet always progressed ab ovo usque mala, from eggs to \napples beginning with the symbol of creation and ending with the \nsymbol of completion. It was recorded that King Herod finished every \nmeal in the Roman style, with an apple. 5 \n\nOne reason for the extreme reverence paid to this fruit is revealed \nby cutting it transversely, as the gypsies and witches did. Hidden in \nthe apple\'s core was the magic pentacle, or sign of Kore (Core). Just as \nKore the Virgin was hidden in the heart of Mother Earth (Demeter) \nand represented the World Soul, so her pentacle was hidden in the \napple. \n\nThe five-pointed star in a circle was the Egyptian hieroglyph for \nthe underworld womb, where resurrection was brought about by the \nmother-heart of "transformations." 6 In Christian iconography also, this \napple-sign represented the Virgin concealed within the Mother, like \nKore within Demeter. (See Anne, Saint.) \n\nAmong gypsies, "occult couples" carefully cut the apple to reveal \nits pentacle and ate it together as magical nourishment during Tannic \nintercourse. 7 A gypsy maiden was supposed to bring about her partner s \nmystic union with the soul of the earth through her own body; thus \nshe was a Shakti, and the apple was her sexual symbol. It was a custom \nfor a gypsy girl to choose her lover by tossing an apple at him, just as \nKali-Shakti chose Shiva to be her doomed bridegroom. 8 \n\nIn Celtic paganism the Goddess\'s apple similarly signified a sacred \n\n\n\n49 \n\n\n\nApple \n\n\n\nVolsungs Teutonic \nclan of demigods \nfavored by Odin, \nwho used a magic apple \nto impregnate the \nmother of the original \nVolsung. His \ndescendant Sigurd is \nbetter known as \nSiegfried, hero of the \nGermanic Ring of \nthe Nibelung. \n\n\n\nmarriage and a journey to the land of death. Queen Guinevere, who \nwas really the Triple Goddess, according to the Welsh Triads, gave a \nmagic apple to "the Irish knight Sir Patrice," actually St. Patrick, \nformerly the father-god or Pater. 9 (See Patrick, Saint.) The Irish \nknight died; Guinevere was denounced as a witch and condemned to \nthe stake, from which Lancelot rescued her. Her offense was choosing a \nsacred king in the ancient ceremonial style. Pre-Christian legends \nshow that each king who ruled Britain had to be chosen by the Triple \nGoddess, and later slain by her Crone form, Morgan, lady of the \nblood-red pentacle and keeper of the Apple-Isle in the west. 10 \n\nHalloween apple-games descended from Celtic feasts of Samhain, \nthe Feast of the Dead at the end of October. Catching at apples \nsuspended from strings, or bobbing in water, may have invoked hanged \nor drowned witches. The games hinted at cheating Death in the form \nof Cerridwen, another name for Morgan as a Sow-goddess. At the end \nof the game, all players ran away "to escape from the black short- \ntailed sow." 11 \n\nHalloween apples were also used for divination, as if they were \noracular ghosts called up from the underworld. Such magic was \nespecially associated with women, harking back to the pagan tradition of \nfemale control of the spirits in that world. The Volsung cycle showed \nthat a man must be provided with "apples of Hel" by his wife, whose \ngift had the power to preserve him when he died and descended \nunder the earth. 12 Thus, Halloween apples were often linked with \nmarriage. One who peeled an apple before a candlelit mirror on \nHalloween would see the image of a future spouse. 13 \n\nApple blossoms were wedding flowers because they represented \nthe Virgin form of the Goddess whose maturity produced the fruit. \nAs the pagan symbols were Christianized, Apple-Eve-Mother-Goddess \nwas said to be reborn as her own younger aspect, Rose-Mary- Virgin- \nGoddess: the five-petaled rose and apple blossom often mystically \ncombined. The red and white Alchemical Rose was an allegory of the \nVirgin Mother. 14 Some mystics said Mary, called the Holy Rose, \nhad invented alchemy. 15 \n\nHowever, the dangerous aspect of apples associated with the \nGoddess as Mother Death were never forgotten. Since she was not \nonly the Virgin and the Mother but also Hel, or Hecate, her apples \nwere often depicted in Christian folklore as poisoned. Churchmen \ndeclared that a witch could cause demonic possession through her gift of \nan apple to her intended victim. 16 Old women were slain for giving \nan apple to a child or other person who later became afflicted with fits. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 187. 2.

The Annals of Ashurbani- \npal said Arabia was governed by queens for as long as anyone could \nremember. 1 The land\'s original Allah was Al-Lat, part of the female \ntrinity along with Kore or Q\'re, the Virgin, and Al-Uzza, the \nPowerful One, the triad known as Manat, the Threefold Moon. 2 \n\nAt Mecca the Goddess was Shaybah or Sheba, the Old Woman, \nworshipped as a black aniconic stone like the Goddess of the Scyth- \nian Amazons. 3 The same Black Stone now enshrined in the Kaaba at \nMecca was her feminine symbol, marked by the sign of the yoni, and \ncovered like the ancient Mother by a veil. 4 No one seems to know \nexactly what it is supposed to represent today. \n\nThe Black Stone rests in the Haram, "Sanctuary," cognate of \n"harem," which used to mean a Temple of Women: in Babylon, a \nshrine of the Goddess Har, mother of harlots. 5 Hereditary guardians \nof the Haram were the Koreshites, "Children of Kore," Mohammed\'s \nown tribe. 6 The holy office was originally held by women, before it was \ntaken over by male priests calling themselves Beni Shaybah, "Sons of \nthe Old Woman." 7 \n\nMohammed\'s legends clearly gave him a matriarchal family \nbackground. His parents\' marriage was matrilocal. His mother remained \nwith her own family and received her husband as an occasional \nvisitor. Mohammed lived with his mother until her death, because she \nwas his true parent according to the ancient system; "children \nbelonged to the woman\'s family . . . paternity in the biological sense was \nrelatively unimportant." 8 She may well have been one of the "aged \npriestesses" who served the temple in Mecca. 9 The traditions of such \npriestesses may well date back to Assyro- Babylonian um-mati or \n"mothers," the only people permitted to enter the Holy of Holies. \nArchaic Arabian shrines were usually served by seven high priest- \nesses, recalling the lawgiving Seven Sages, who were women. 10 The \nfirst collection of the books of law called Koran the Word of Kore, \nor Q\'re was attributed to them. \n\nPre-Islamic Arabia was dominated by the female-centered clans. \nMarriages were matrilocal, inheritance matrilineal. Polyandry \nseveral husbands to one wife was common. Men lived in their wives\' \nhomes. Divorce was initiated by the wife. If she turned her tent to \nface east for three nights in a row, the husband was dismissed and for- \nbidden to enter the tent again. 11 \n\nDoctrines attributed to Mohammed simply reversed the ancient \nsystem in favor of men. A Moslem husband could dismiss his wife by \nsaying "I divorce thee" three times. As in Europe, the change from \nmatriarchate to patriarchate came about only gradually and with \nmuch strife. \n\n\n\nArabia \n\n\n\nAnnals of \n\nAshurbanipal Assyrian \nroyal chronicles on \ncuneiform tablets, \ndating from the 7th \ncentury B.C., found in \nthe king\'s famous \nlibrary at Nineveh by \n19th-century \narcheologists. \n\n\n\nSeven Sages Legendary \nfigures in both Greek \nand Arabian lore, \nidentified with a variety \nof seers and \nphilosophers, the \nearliest ones usually \nfemale, confused with \nthe Seven Sisters, or \nPleiades. \n\n\n\nSI \n\n\n\nArabia \n\n\n\nShi\'ites Minority sect \nof Islam, tracing \ndescent of a sacred \ncaliphate from \nMohammed\'s daughter \nFatima and her \nhusband \'Ali. One line \nof Shi\'ites established \nthe powerful Fatimid \ncaliphate, now \nrepresented by the \nKhojas, Bohras, and \nthe Druze of Syria. \n\n\n\nMany Koreshites remained faithful to the Goddess and to their \nqueen, Hind al-Hunud: the Hind of Hinds, similar to the title of \nArtemis. She was also called Lady of Victory. But her victories came to \nan end with one of the last queens, whose husband betrayed her and \nsurrendered her city of Makkah to the enemy. \n\nLegend claims the step-daughter of the divine Hind married \nMohammed himself. 12 However, the history of early-medieval Arabia \nis nearly all legend. Like Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, and other founders \nof patriarchal religions, Mohammed lacks real verification. There is \nno reliable information about his life or teachings. Most stories about \nhim are as apocryphal as the story that his coffin hangs forever in \nmid-air "between heaven and earth," like the bodies of ancient sacred \nkings. 13 \n\nWith or without Mohammed, Islam succeeded in becoming com- \npletely male-dominated, making no place for women except in \nslavery or in the seclusion of the harem. Islamic mosques still bear signs \nreading: "Women and dogs and other impure animals are not \npermitted to enter." H \n\nNevertheless, traces of the Goddess proved ineradicable. Like the \nvirgin Mary, Arabia\'s Queen of Heaven received a mortal form and a \nsubordinate position as Fatima, Mohammed\'s "daughter." But she was \nno real daughter. She was known as Mother of her Father, and \nSource of the Sun: "the illumination that separates Light and Darkness; \nthe Tree of Paradise; the Red Cow who suckles all the children of the \nearth; Fate; the Night, the World; the Moon; the Pure Essence of \nBeing." 15 Like her western counterpart Mary, she was compared to \nthe Burning Bush, and the Night of Power; "she personified the center \nof the genealogical mystery." 16 \n\nFatima\'s name means The Creatress. A Shi\'a text, Omm-al-Kitab, \nsaid she appeared "at the creation of the material world," crowned, \nseated on a throne, holding a sword, and "ornamented with a million \nvaricolored shimmering lights" which illuminated the entire garden of \nParadise. She was the first to occupy the Seat of Dominion, "the \nresting place of Allah, the Most High." 17 Her symbol as Holy Virgin, \nthe crescent moon, still appears on Islamic flags. 18 She is called Al- \nZahra, "Bright-Blooming," a former title of the Great Mother. It is \nsaid the symbol of her hand, surmounting the solar disc, "represents the \nwhole religion of Islam." 19 \n\nWithin Islam, deviant sects like Shi\'ites or Sufis carried on Tantric \nworship of the female principle, maintaining that the feminine \npowers of sexuality and maternity were the powers that held the \nuniverse together. 20 The greatest medieval poet of Sufism, Ibn al- \nFarid, was known as "the sultan of lovers." 21 He said true divinity was \nfemale, and Mecca was the womb of the earth. As woman-worship- \nping minstrels of medieval Europe were attacked for their devotion to the \nGoddess of Love, so the Sufis were attacked for their "voluptuous \n\n\n\n52 \n\n\n\nlibertinism." Ibn El-Arabi, the "greatest master" of Sufi mystics, was Arabia \n\naccused of blasphemy because he said the godhead is female. 22 \n\nShi\'ites split off from orthodox Islam and claimed to follow a purer ___^_^_^_ \nline of imams directly descended from the Fatimids. In the 1 1th \ncentury they united under Hasan ibn al-Sabbah, i.e., Hasan ben- \nShaybah, another "son of the Matriarch." Hasan seized the fortress \nof Alamut and made it the headquarters of a brotherhood of warriors, \nthe hashishim or "Assassins" (see Aladdin). The fortress fell to the \nconcerted attacks of Mongols and Mamelukes in 1256, after having \nwaged war on Turks and Christian crusaders alike for more than a \ncentury. 23 \n\nStill the Shi\'ite sect survived to the present, awaiting the coming of \nthe Virgin named Paradise (Pairidaeza), who will give birth to the \nMahdi, the "moon-guided" Redeemer, whose title in Europe was the \nDesired Knight. 24 \n\nOne of the hidden secrets of medieval bardic romance is the \nArabian origin of the Waste Land motif, most prominent in the Holy \nGrail cycle of tales. Despite monkish efforts to convert it into a \nChristian chalice, the Grail was generally recognized as a female \nsymbol, whose loss implied fear for the fertility of the earth. Crusad- \ners had seen for themselves the desolation of Arabia Deserta, one of the \nmost lifeless regions on earth. They heard the Shi\'ite heretics\' \nexplanation for it: Islam had offended the Great Goddess, and she \nhad cursed the land and departed. Now nothing would grow there. \n\nWestern mystics thought the same calamity would strike Europe \nif the spirit of the Mother were not brought back from the limbo to \nwhich the Christian church consigned her. This may have been a \nreason for the frenzy of cathedral-building in honor of "Our Lady," the \nQueen of Heaven, during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Waste \nLand theme haunted the collective psyche of the early Renaissance with \na threat of conditions actually realized in the land of the infidel. \n\nTraces of the matriarchate survived to the present among some of \nthe Arabs of North Africa, ancient home of "Libyan Amazons." 25 \nTargi and Tuareg Berber women remained free of many sexual \nrestrictions. Virginity was not prized. On remarriage, a woman could \ncommand twice the bride-price of a young virgin. Men of the \nWalad \'Abdi tribe insisted the success of their crops depended on the \nsexual freedom of their women, whom the French labeled common \nprostitutes. Hassanyeh Arabs of the White Nile allowed wives to be \nunfaithful on certain days of the week, according to the marriage \ncontract drawn up by the bride\'s mother who took pride in preserving \nher daughter\'s sexual liberties. 27 Most of Islam, however, restricted \nwomen as much as possible. Many Islamic theologians said women \ncouldn\'t enter paradise, and must not receive religious instruction \nbecause it might bring them "too near their masters." 28 \n\nl.Assyr. & Bab.

Graves, CM. 1, 347; 2, 381. \n\n\n\nAriana \n\nArchaic name of Iran and its Great Goddess, sometimes rendered \nMariana. \n\n\n\nArianism \n\nEarly Christian heresy founded by Arius in the 4th century a.d. The \nbasic tenet of Arianism was that God was not a trinity but a unit or \nmonad. \n\nOrphics and other mystery-cultists of the early Christian era \nmaintained the classic trinitarian pattern laid down thousands of years \nbefore by the Triple Goddess. They said: "All things are made by one \ngodhead in three names, and this god is all things." From the \nmystery-cults, some Christians picked up the idea that their deity too \nshould be a trinity. Other Christians objected, saying their deity must \nbe a monad like the Jewish Jehovah. St. Augustine found the notion of a \ntrinity incomprehensible. He scoffed at his pagan neighbors for \ncalling their Great Goddess three persons and one person at the same \ntime. 1 \n\nNeither the Old nor the New Testament mentioned a triune God, \nso early Pauline Christians worshipped God as one individual. How- \never, this monotheistic idea was abandoned at the 4th-century Council \nof Nicaea. Arian Christians, clinging to the Hebraic belief in an \nundivided God, suddenly found themselves labeled heretics. In increas- \ningly acrimonious battles, partisans of one viewpoint or the other \nengaged in street fighting with stones and clubs, bloodying their oppo- \nnents to prove the nature of their deity. 2 \n\nArius\'s objections to the Holy Trinity were basically logical. He \ninsisted that a divine son couldn\'t have co-existed eternally with his \nown divine father. There must have been a time when the father existed \nalone, before bringing the son into being. But Arius\'s opponents \nwanted to be assured that, in assimilating the body and blood of Christ \nin communion, they partook of an infinite divinity who had existed \n\n\n\n55 \n\n\n\nArianrhod from the beginning of time. Otherwise they might be robbed of immor- \n\ntality, through unwise identification with a lesser, finite power. \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Therefore they insisted that Christ and God were one and the same. \n\nBesides, pagan traditions universally supported the notion that \ndivine fathers and sons were identical with each other, cyclically \nalternating and united through the Mother. Proponents of the trinitar- \nian theory borrowed myths and symbols from the pagans, and said \nwhen the Magi saw the star in the east announcing Christ\'s birth, three \nsuns appeared in the sky and fused into one. 3 \n\nThe emperor Constantine I at first defended Arius, because he \nliked the idea of a single supreme deity whom he might identify with \nhimself. He also disliked the Christians\' incessant sectarian strife. He \nwrote to Bishop Alexander: "I am sending to you, not simply suggest- \ning, but imploring that you will take these men (the Arians) back . . . \nthat there is peace and concord among you all." 4 This was ignored. \n\nThe Council decided that God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost were \none and the same, forever co-existent, equally potent. Arius was \nanathematized and driven into exile. At last he succumbed to a dose of \npoison, apparently administered by one of his trinitarian opponents. 5 \nBut the battle was not over. The Arian controversy dragged on for \nmany centuries, and spilled much blood, as theological arguments \nwere wont to do in those days. \n\nAfter 360 a.d., Arianism was carried by missionaries to the Ger- \nmanic tribes, whose Christianity remained a vaguely Arian semi- \npaganism up to the time of Charlemagne and beyond. 6 Arianism came \nto the surface again in Hungary and Transylvania during the 16th \ncentury. Christian writers then denied the trinity altogether, starting a \nmovement that led ultimately to the foundation of Unitarian churches. 7 \n\nl.Briffault3,90. 2. de Camp, A.E., 282. 3.de Voragine,49. \n\n4.

In \nMesopotamia and Egypt, the sun god was generally considered a child \n)f the moon-, earth-, sea-, or heaven-goddess. \n\n\n\nArinna \nArk \n\n\n\nVrk of the Covenant \n\n)n its earliest appearances in the Bible, the ark of the covenant was so \nacer (taboo, dangerous) that it would kill at a touch. While it was \neing transported on an oxcart, it teetered "because the oxen shook \n:" and would have fallen, had not Uzzah "put forth his hand to the ark \nif God, and took hold of it" (2 Samuel 6:3). In spite of Uzzah\'s good \nitentions, God instantly struck him dead for daring to touch the \nloly object. \n\nAgain, when the ark returned from Philistia, God perpetrated an \nxtraordinary slaughter of 50,070 well-intentioned people for daring \n3 look inside the ark in their joy: "And he smote the men of \nlethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even \ne smote of tlfe people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and \nle people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the \neople with a great slaughter" (1 Samuel 6:19). \n\nEven priests feared the power of the ark, and resorted to ritual \n/ashing before approaching it, "that they die not" (Exodus 30:20). \nVater was a common prophylactic charm against the destructive power \nf holy things. Philon of Byzantium said all the "ancients" used water \n)r ritual purification before entering temples; they also spun prayer- \n\'heels made of Aphrodite\'s sacred metal, copper. 1 \n\nFor some reason God lost interest in his ark by Jeremiah\'s time: \nSaith the Lord, they shall say no more, the ark of the covenant of \nle Lord: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; \neither shall it be magnified any more" (Jeremiah 3:16). \n\nThe probable cause of God\'s change of heart was a reform \nlovement to purge the temple of sexual symbols. The arks or cistae of \nle Greeks and Syrians held emblems of the lingam-yoni, such as eggs \nnd serpents, clay or dough models of genitalia. Rabbinical tradition \nlid the ark contained a hexagram representing the sexual union of God \nnd Goddess, the same meaning given to the hexagram in India. 2 \n\'hus the ark was a female container for a male god. Mary, God\'s \nDnsort in her later form, often received the title of "Ark." \n\nSemitic Arek, "ark," descended from Hindu Argha, "great ship," \nletaphorically the Great Yoni: a female-sexual vessel bearing seeds \nf life through the sea of chaos between destruction of one cosmos and \nreation of the next. 3 From the same root came "arcane," literally a \nark or crescent phase of the moon. The crescent moon boat symbol- \ned the Goddess\'s spirit dancing on her primordial uterine Ocean of \n\n\n\nvar.

H.Smith, 227. \n\n\n\nArtemis \n\nAmazonian Moon-goddess, worshipped at Ephesus under the Latin \nname of Diana or "Goddess-Anna." Like the Hindu Goddess Saranyu \nwho gave birth to all animals, she was called Mother of Creatures. \nHer image at Ephesus had a whole torso covered with breasts, to show \nthat she nurtured all living things. Yet she was also the Huntress, \nkiller of the very creatures she brought forth. 1 In Sparta her name was \ngiven as Artamis, "Cutter," or "Butcher." 2 \n\nArtemis\'s myths extend back to Neolithic sacrificial customs. At \nTaurus her holy women, under their high priestess Iphigeneia, \nsacrificed all men who landed on their shores, nailing the head of each \nvictim to a cross. 3 At Hierapolis, the Goddess\'s victims were hung on \nartificial trees in her temple. In Attica, Artemis was ritually propitiated \nwith drops of blood drawn from a man\'s neck by a sword, a symbolic \nremnant of former beheadings. Human victims were later replaced by \nbulls, hence the Goddess\'s title Tauropolos, "bull-slayer." 4 \n\nHer Huntress aspect was another form of the destroying Crone or \nwaning moon. Like Hecate, she led the nocturnal hunt; her pries- \ntesses wore the masks of hunting dogs. Alani, "hunting dogs," was the \nGreek name for Scythians who revered Artemis. The mythological \nhunting dogs who tore the Horned God Actaeon to pieces were really \nArtemis\'s sacred bitches. \n\nClassic mythographers pretended that Actaeon committed the sin \nof seeing the chaste virgin Goddess in her bath, and she condemned \n\n\n\nCft \n\n\n\nhim out of offended modesty. Actually, the bath, the nakedness, and the \ntearing to pieces of the sacred king were all part of the drama. In \nbarbarian Germany, the Goddess\'s ritual bath could be witnessed only \nby "men doomed to die." 5 Actaeon\'s deerskin and antlers marked \nhim as the pre-Hellenic stag king, reigning over the sacred hunt for half \na Great Year before he was torn to pieces and replaced by his tanist \n(co-king). In the first century a.d., Artemis\'s priestesses still pursued and \nkilled a man dressed as a stag on the Goddess\'s mountain. 6 Her \ngroves became the "deer-gardens" (German Tiergarten, Swedish Djur- \ngarden), once the scene of venison feasts. \n\nOne of Artemis\'s most popular animal incarnations was the Great \nShe-Bear, Ursa Major, ruler of the stars and protectress of the axis \nmundi, Pole of the World, marked in heaven by the Pole Star at the \ncenter of the small circle described by the constellation Ursa Major. \nHelvetian tribes in the neighborhood of Berne worshipped her as the \nShe-Bear, which is still the heraldic symbol of Berne. The city\'s very \nname means "She-Bear." 7 Sometimes the Helvetians called her Artio, \nshortened to Art by Celtic peoples who coupled her with the bear- \nking Arthur. As Artio\'s Lord of the Hunt, the medieval god of witches \ncame to be known as "Robin son of Art." According to the Irish, Art \nmeant "God," but its earlier connotation was "Goddess" specifically \nthe Bear-Goddess. 8 She was also canonized as a Christian saint, \nUrsula, derived from her Saxon name of Ursel, the She-Bear. \n\nThere was a rather sophisticated astronomical reason for worship- \nping the heavenly She-Bear who followed her track around the Pole \nStar, year by year. It was probably discovered first in the far east. "The \nmonths and seasons are determined by the revolution of Ursa Major. \nThe tail of the constellation pointing to the east at nightfall announces \nthe arrival of spring, pointing to the south the arrival of summer, \npointing to the west the arrival of autumn, and pointing to the north the \narrival of winter. . . . The Great Bear occupies a prominent position \nin the Taoist heavens as the aerial throne of the supreme deity." This \ndeity in Taoist tradition is the Queen of Heaven, Holy Mother Ma \nTsu P\'o, with characteristics similar to those of Artemis. She protects \nseafarers and governs the weather; she is called a virgin, and Matron \nof the Measure; she is a Mother of Mercy who has been compared to \nthe virgin Mary and to the Buddhist Goddess Maritchi. 9 \n\nThe axis mundi was often associated with male gods, as either a \nGreat Serpent or a World Tree more or less recognized as a phallic \nsymbol. Similarly the Little Bear within the circle of the Great Bear was \npictured by the Greeks as Areas, her son (see Callisto). Yet among \nthe oldest traditions may be found hints that this world-supporting tree \nor pole was female. Even as Yggdrasil, the World Tree of the \nVikings, it showed many parallels with birth-giving, fruit- or milk- \nproducing mother trees of the Near East, under its older name of \nMjotvidr or Mutvidr, "Mother-Tree." Sometimes it was Mead-Tree, \nlike "the milk-giving tree of the Finno-Ugric peoples, a symbol which \nmust go back ultimately to Mesopotamia, and be of great antiquity." It \n\n\n\nArtemis \n\n\n\nUrsa Major "Great \nBear," colloquially \ncalled the Big \nDipper, a circumpolar \nconstellation with \nseven bright stars \nincluding the "north \npole pointers." For a \nbrief time the \nconstellation was \nrenamed Charles\'s \nWain, after the chariot \nof Charlemagne. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n\n\nArtha \nArthur \n\n\n\nTatian 2nd-century \nChristian apologist of \nGreek education and \nGnostic leanings.

Its fruit could be given to women \nin childbirth "that what is within may pass out." The spring at the tree\'s \nroot was a fountain of wisdom or of the life-giving fluid aurr, which \nmay be likened to the "wise blood" of the Mother that much- \nmythologized feminine life-source likened to the Kula nectar in the \nuterine spring of Kundalini, as if the maternal tree upholding the \nuniverse were the Mother\'s spine with its many chakras. 10 See \nMenstrual Blood. \n\n"Many-breasted" Artemis was always a patroness of nurture, \nfertility, and birth. Male gods turned against these attributes in \nopposing the cult of the Goddess. Her own twin brother and sometime \nconsort Apollo made birth illegal on his sacred isle of Delos; \npregnant women had to be removed from the island lest they offend the \ngod by giving birth there. 11 Christians continued to vilify Artemis. \nTatian said, "Artemis is a poisoner; Apollo performs cures." 12 The \nGospels demanded destruction of Artemis\'s Ephesian temple (Acts \n19:27). St. John Chrysostom preached against this temple in 406 a.d. \nSoon afterward, it was looted and burned.

See Earth. \n\n\n\nArthur \n\nKing Arthur was the Welsh Arth Vawr, Heavenly Bear. His prede- \ncessor or "father" was Uther Pendragon, "Wonderful Head of the \nDragon." 1 Where did the dragon\'s head precede the bear? At the \nhub of the heavens, which the ancients always anxiously watched. \n\nIn the 3rd millenium b.c, the north pole star was not the present \nPolaris in Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. It was Alpha Draconis, the \nHead of the Dragon. 2 Due to precession of the equinoxes, a slow subtle \nshift of the celestial pole took place over the course of 5000 years. \nHowever difficult it may have been to observe, the ancients seem to \n\n\n\n60 \n\n\n\nhave known about it. India as well as Britain placed the former north \npole in the constellation of the Dragon. The Mahabharata said the pole \nstar, to which "the yoke of the world" was fixed, was the head of the \nGreat Serpent. 3 \n\nGreeks said the little bear-god who replaced the serpent was Areas, \nancestor of the Arcadians. His mother was Artemis Calliste, the \nGreat She-Bear who used to rule all the stars. 4 As Ursa Major, she still \ncircles the pole. Western Europeans called her Artio, Art, Ursel, or \nErcel. 5 Arthur was a Celtic version of her son, spouse, sacred king. \n\nArthur was another humanization of an old pagan god apparent- \nly very old, for he had no credible human parentage but rather many \ncontradictory miraculous-birth myths. Some said he had no father. Like \nthe Norse god Heimdall and the Saxon hero Scyld, he was born of \nthe Ninefold Sea-goddess and cast ashore on the ninth wave, to land at \nMerlin\'s feet. 6 Bulfinch\'s Mythology said Arthur\'s father was Ambro- \nsius, an earlier name for Merlin. \n\nThe story of Uther Pendragon\'s fatherhood of Arthur bears marks \nof strained revision. Arthur\'s royal mother was married to Uther\'s \nrival at the time. Uther was far away, but with Merlin\'s help he sent his \nspirit to her in the guise of her husband, while the latter was being \nkilled. Arthur was begotten at the instant his official father died. He was \ntaken away by Merlin to be raised in a secret place until he came of \nage the cliche secret upbringing of every sacred king\'s career. \n\nArthur\'s mother was really the Triple Goddess, incarnate in the \nqueen as usual. Her three daughters represented herself in triad: \nElaine, the virgin Lily Maid; Margawse, mother of the four Aeons; \nMorgan, Queen of the Shades. Arthur later coupled with his sister \nMargawse and incestuously begot his own son-nephew-supplanter, \nMordred, who was likewise taken away at birth to be raised in hiding. \n\nAs Galahad was the reincarnated Lancelot, so Mordred was the \nreincarnated Arthur, destined to succeed him by both matrilineal and \npatrilineal right, as both sister\'s-son and son. Like all kings threatened by \nthe Oedipal rival, Arthur tried to kill Mordred by a Slaughter of the \nInnocents. He collected all the children born on May Day, the birthday \nof his prophesied supplanter, put them on a ship, and sent them out \nto sea to be wrecked. Of course Mordred survived the wreck and grew \nup to return incognito to Arthur\'s court. 8 \n\nArthur lost his sacred mana when he lost his queen, the Triple \nGoddess incarnate in Guinevere, who was really three Guineveres \naccording to the Welsh Triads. 9 Mordred seized her, thus symbolically \nseizing the kingdom, and brought Arthur to his death. \n\nWhen Arthur died, the same Triple Goddess took him back into \nthe sea that gave him birth. "Three fairy queens" carried him away to \nthe western isles of paradise, singing his death-song, the kind of song \nWelsh bards called marwysgafen giving-back-to-the-sea-mother. 10 \nThe three fairy queens were really the final triad of the Ninefold \nGoddess, Morgan le Fay and two of her alter egos: the Queen of \n\n\n\nArthur \n\n\n\nMahabharata \n\nIndian epic poem, \nconsisting of historical \nand legendary \nmaterial gathered \nbetween the 4th and \n10th centuries a.d., \nincluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\nWelsh Triads \n\nPoetic literature of pre- \nChristian Wales, drawn \nfrom the bards\' oral \ntradition. \n\nNinefold Goddess \n\nThe triple trinity, as \nexemplified by the \nNine Muses of Greece, \nthe Nine Sisters of \nScandinavia, the Nine \nMorgans of the \nFortunate Isles, etc. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n\n\nAryan \nAsceticism \n\n\n\nBrythonicOfthe \n\nBritish branch of Celts, \nincluding speakers of \nthe Welsh, Cornish, \nand Breton \nlanguages. \n\n\n\nNorthgallis (i.e., North Gaul, or Brittany), and the Queen of the \nWesterlands, which meant the isles of the dead. 11 These isles were \nsaid to be ruled by nine fairy sisters, the leader of whom was Morgan. \n\nArthur\'s legends generally suggest no human king, but a Brythonic \ngod, whom Johnson called a Celtic Zeus. 12 He may have been \nincarnate in one or several warrior kings for brief periods, but his basic \nstory was mythic rather than historical. \n\n1.

In Persia he \nbecame known as Ahriman, the dark earth god, opponent or \nsubterranean alter ego of the solar deity Ormazd (Ahura Mazda). In \nCeltic Ireland he was Eremon, one of the sacred kings who married \nthe Earth (Tara). \n\nThough there was nothing "pure" about either the name or the \nfar-flung mixture of tribes it was supposed to describe, the term \n"pure Aryan" was revived in Nazi Germany to support a mythological \nconcept of Teutonic stock, the so-called Master Race. Non-Aryans \nwere all the "inferior" strains: Semites, Negroes, gypsies, Slavs, and \nLatinate or "swarthy" people whose blood was said to be polluting \nthe Nordic superiority of their betters. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 33. \n\n\n\nAsceticism \n\nThe religion of self-denial, such as practiced by early Christian \neremites, characterized by self-inflicted pain, hunger, and other auster- \nities, and renunciation of sensual pleasures. \n\nPerhaps the earliest sectaries to regard asceticism as the key \nto heaven were Jain Buddhists (see Jains), whose theology influenced \nPersian patriarchs, who in turn influenced Jewish eremites like the \nEssenes. Jain Buddhist monks had already penetrated the courts of \nSyria, Egypt, Macedonia, and Epirus by the 4th century B.C., and \nwere glorified in legend for the alleged magic powers they developed \nthrough prodigies of self-denial. 1 \n\nOriginally, men\'s ascetic practices seem to have evolved from a \nnotion that extreme forms of self-denial would bring them the \nmagical female capacity to give birth. Oriental myths said the first \n\n\n\n62 \n\n\n\ncreator-gods acquired the ability to produce living things by "practic- \ning fierce asceticism for ten thousand years." 2 \n\nThough men never achieved the ability to give birth, they claimed \nother miraculous powers developed by asceticism. Perfected eremites \nwere said to fly, to walk on water, to understand all languages, to turn \nbase metals into gold, to heal lameness and blindness, and other \nmiracles that became the common property of all scriptures including \nthe Christian ones. 5 \n\nJain Buddhists looked upon women as hopelessly inferior in the \npursuit of asceticism. Their handbook said no woman could achieve \nNirvana, because "in the womb, between the breasts, in their navel and \nloins, a subtle emanation of life is continually taking place. How then \ncan they be fit for self-control? A woman may be pure in faith and even \noccupied with a study of the sutras or the practice of a terrific \nasceticism; in her case there will be no falling away of karmic matter." 4 \n\nSome of the ascetics openly despised sexuality and motherhood. \nThe Mahabharata anticipated St. Augustine\'s remarks about the \nnastiness of birth: "-Man emerges mixed with excrement and water, \nfouled with the impurities of woman. A wise man will avoid the \ncontaminating society of women as he would the touch of bodies \ninfested with vermin." 5 Some advertised their renunciation of sex by \ncastrating themselves or affixing large metal rings in the flesh of the \npenis. 6 \n\nEssenic Judaism and early Christianity were offshoots of the Jain \ntradition, urging abandonment of the family and of all secular \nconcerns. 7 Like the art of the Jains, Christian art in the early medieval \nperiod showed stiff, crude, doll-like figures, apparently bodiless under \ntheir wooden draperies, even hands and faces badly drawn. Not even \nartists were permitted to study the human form. 8 To look at some- \nthing attractive especially if it was made of flesh was highly suspect \nbecause the observer might enjoy the act of looking. According to St. \nJerome, a Christian must consider poisonous every act or experience \nhaving the smallest hint of sensual pleasure. 9 \n\nPain, however, was permitted and encouraged throughout the \nChristian era. St. Catherine of Siena was highly praised for whipping \nherself three times a day, once for her own sins, once for the sins of the \nliving, and once for the sins of the dead. St. Simeon Stylites was \nglorified for remaining motionless on top of his pillar, like Buddhist \nstanding-yogis, until his living flesh rotted. 10 \n\nFathers of the church constantly urged asceticism upon the faith- \nful. Gregory of Nyssa touted it in terms of both wetness and dryness: \n"As the tympanum, from which all moisture has been removed so that it \nis exceedingly dry, gives out a loud noise, so also is virginity, which \nreceives no life-giving moisture, illustrious and renowned." " Again he \nsaid: "We often see water, contained in a pipe, bursting upward \nthrough this constraining force, which will not let it leak, and this in \nspite of its natural gravitation; in the same way the mind of man, \n\n\n\nAsceticism \n\n\n\nMahabharata \n\nIndian epic poem, \nconsisting of \nhistorical and legendary \nmaterial gathered \nbetween the 4th and \n10th centuries a.d., \nincluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n\n\nAsceticism enclosed in the compact channel of an habitual continence, and not \n\nhaving any side issues, will be raised by virtue of its natural powers of \n^ B| ^ B ^^^^ B i^^ motion to an exalted love." n \n\nMoral tales told by the Christian fathers concentrated on renuncia- \ntion of sexual love, and acceptance of painful martyrdom. The tale of \nSts. Cyprian and Justina is typical. Cyprian, a pagan sorcerer, fell in love \nwith the Christian maiden Justina and cast a love spell on her. \nThough sworn to virginity like all good Christian maidens, Justina was \ntortured by desire. Nevertheless she conquered her desire and proved \nher piety with such prodigies of asceticism that she impressed even \nCyprian: she fasted almost to death, she slept naked on the stony \nground, she mutilated herself to spoil her beauty. 13 Cyprian was so \nintrigued by all this he turned Christian too, and was martyred along \nwith his incorrigible virgin. 14 \n\nHuman love was anathema to the early Christians who insisted \nthat families must be abandoned. Sexual impulses were perverted \ninto unnatural obsessions. 15 The fall of Rome was not entirely unrelated \nto Christians\' abhorrence of the basic social unit of the state: the \ninterlocked loyalties and dependencies of the family. Jesus himself \nundermined the family in his teaching: "If any man come to me, and \nhate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and breth- \nren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple" \n(Luke 14:26). Becker says Christianity stood for "renunciation of this \nworld and the satisfactions of this life, which is why the pagans thought \nChristianity was crazy. It was a sort of anti-heroism by an animal who \ndenied life in order to deny evil." 16 \n\nPrinciples of asceticism so embedded themselves in Christian \nsociety that nearly every kind of sensual pleasure came to be regarded \nas wicked only because it was pleasant. The delights of sacramental \ndancing were forbidden. A story from Ramersdorf in the Rhine- \nland tells of a Christian missionary priest who found youths and maidens \ndancing together on the Sabbath. He called God\'s curse on them, \nwhich forced them to go on dancing day and night until they lost their \nminds. 17 Some European peasants still abstain from sexual inter- \ncourse during the sowing season, in the church-fostered belief that \nsexual activity might call down a curse on the crop. 18 \n\nIn the 18th century, theologians were still preaching the wicked- \nness of even the most subtle feelings of pleasure. Beaumont \ncounseled women especially to attribute any enjoyable bodily sensation \nto the devil\'s influence: "If ye perceive a sudden sweet taste in your \nmouths or feel any warmth in your breasts, like fire, or any form of \npleasure in any part of your body, or ... if ye become aware by \noccasion of pleasure or satisfaction derived from such perception, that \nyour hearts are drawn away from the contemplation of Jesus Christ \nand from spiritual exercises . . . then this sensation is very much to be \nsuspected of coming from the Enemy; and therefore were it ever so \nwonderful and striking, still renounce it." 19 Yet the obsessive contem- \n\n\n\n64 \n\n\n\nplation of pain, starting with Jesus\'s pain on the cross, was always to Asceticism \n\nbe encouraged. \n\nThe most significant difference between Christianity and its pagan ^^^^^^^^^_ \nforerunners was this reversal of the pleasure-pain continuum. Earlier \nsocieties regarded sensual pleasure as a touch of divinity, and "bliss" \nsexual or otherwise as a foretaste of heaven. Woman was a carrier \nof the divine spark because of her capacity to give and receive physical \npleasure. The Christian theory turned this opinion completely \naround. Fathers of the church taught that the human race must die out \nthrough universal celibacy, before Jesus could return and establish his \nheaven on earth. Reasoning that man fell from grace through woman, \nman could return to grace only by renouncing woman. 20 Therefore, \nmedieval churchmen came to identify sexuality with the worst of \nheresies and sins, especially since St. Augustine had labeled it the \npipeline of original sin. Even Protestant theologians adopted this view. \nCalvin said that, because of its origin in sexuality and in a woman\'s \nbody, every child was "defiled and polluted" in God\'s sight even before \nit saw the light of the day; a newborn infant is a "seed-bed of sin and \ntherefore cannot but be odious and abominable to God." Martin Luther \nmarried an ex-nun, but still didn\'t think much of sex. He said, "Had \nGod consulted me in the matter, I would have advised him to continue \nthe generation of the species by fashioning them out of clay." 21 \n\nThis note of arrogance, even hubris, in the idea of man issuing \ninstructions to God, was always a hidden component of asceticism, \ndespite its outward show of extreme or unnatural humility. "Nothing is \nprouder than the humility of the ascetic of other-worldly spirit that \nproclaims itself superior to the whole natural world, or than the \nmysticism that renounces the self only to commune with God \nhimself." 22 Here lies the real reason for men\'s secret delight in ascetic \nprinciples and practices. It must be remembered that the original \npurpose of such self-denial was to become identified with a god and to \nacquire God\'s sacred powers for one\'s self. \n\nBecoming a god meant acquiring the ability to perform miracles, as \nmany Christian ascetics were supposed to have done. By definition, \nmiracles flouted the laws of nature. Thus the ascetic became deliberate- \nly un-natural, confusing the denial of his own instinctual desires with \ndenial of Mother Nature\'s observed habits. Ascetic ideals therefore \nplaced body and spirit in conflict with each other. "Asceticism is the \nethical code which arises inevitably from a dualistic opposition between \nthe spiritual and the natural. These are represented as absolutely irre- \nconcilable and mutually antagonistic; if a man is to escape the natural he \nmust renounce the rights of his physical nature in the interests of his \nspiritual." 25 The psychic problem of such dualistic opinion is still much \nin evidence. \n\n1.

Angus, 219. \n\n\n\nAsherah \n\nSemitic name of the Great Goddess, possibly from Old Iranian asha, \n"Universal Law," a law of the matriarch, like Roman ius naturale. 1 \nAsherah was "in wisdom the Mistress of the Gods." 2 Sumerians \ncalled her Ashnan, "strength of all things," and "a kindly and bountiful \nmaiden." 3 Her sacred city Mar-ash appears in the Bible as Mareshah \n(Joshua 15:44). \n\nThe Old Testament "Asherah" is translated "grove," without any \nexplanation that the sacred grove represented the Goddess\'s genital \ncenter, birthplace of all things. In the matriarchal period, Hebrews \nworshipped the Goddess in groves (1 Kings 14:23), later cut down by \npatriarchal reformers who burned the bones of Asherah\'s priests on their \nown altars (2 Chronicles 24:4-5). \n\nThe Goddess\'s grove-yoni was Athra qaddisa, "the holy place" \n(literally, "divine harlot"). Sometimes she was called simply "Holi- \nness," a word later applied to Yahweh. Canaanites called her Qaniyatu \nelima, She Who Gives Birth to the Gods, or Rabbatu athiratu \nyammi, Lady Who Traverses the Sea (i.e., the Moon). 4 Rabbatu was an \nearly female form of rabbi. Athirat, Athra, Aethra, Athyr, and Egypt\'s \nHathor were all variations of the same name for the Goddess. 5 In Egypt \nshe was also a Law-giving Mother, Ashesh, an archaic form of Isis; \nthe name meant both "pouring out" and "supporting," the functions of \nher breasts. Her yonic shrine in Thebes was Asher, Ashrel, or Ashrelt. \nSome called her "Great Lady of Ashert, the lady of heaven, the queen \nof the gods." 6 \n\nFor a while, Asherah accepted the Semitic god El as her consort. \nShe was the Heavenly Cow, he the Bull. 7 After their sacred marriage, \nshe bore the Heavenly Twins, Shaher and Shalem, the stars of morning \nand evening (see Lucifer). The marriage rite seems to have involved \nthe cooking of a kid in its mother\'s milk, a procedure later forbidden by \nJewish priests (Exodus 23:19). 8 \n\n1. Larousse, 312; Bachofen, 192. 2.

Ashes were called the seed of \nthe fire god Agni, with power to absolve all sins. Even if a man does \n"a thousand things that one ought not to do, by bathing in ashes he will \ncause all of that to be burnt to ashes as fire burns a forest with its ener- \ngy." Another source said ashes stood for the purifying blood of Shiva, in \n\n\n\n66 \n\n\n\nwhich one could bathe away sins, as Christians bathed in the blood of \nthe Lamb. 1 \n\nAt Rome\'s New Year Feast of Atonement in March, people wore \nsackcloth and bathed in ashes to atone for their sins. 2 Then as now, \nNew Year\'s Eve was a carnival of eating, drinking, and sinning, on the \ntheory that all sins would be wiped out the following day. As the \ndying god of March, Mars took his worshippers\' sins with him into \ndeath. Therefore the carnival fell on dies martis, the Day of Mars. In \nEnglish this was Tuesday, because Mars was identified with the Saxon \ngod Tiw. In French the carnival day was Mardi Gras, "Fat Tues- \nday," the day of merrymaking before Ash Wednesday. \n\nA Catholic directory of 1 5 1 1 ordered priests to say to the congre- \ngation on Ash Wednesday, "Remember, man, you are ashes and to \nashes will return." Fuller\'s Church History said the purpose of Ash \nWednesday was to remind every man that he is "but ashes and earth, \nand thereto shall return." 5 These maxims oddly contradicted the \nchurch\'s official doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh. Their purpose \nwas to justify with* some Christian gloss the ancient notion that \nredemption might be brought about by contact with ashes. \n\n1. O\'Flaherty, 148-49, 174. 2. Encyc.

Tobit\'s Asmodeus was really "the god \nAsmo," or Aeshma, a Persian deity associated with Ahriman. Zoroastri- \nan priests may have brought about his original diabolization because \nof an archaic connection with the Goddess Ma. 1 \n\n1 . Larousse, 3 1 8. \n\n\n\nBook of Tobit One \n\nof the Apocrypha, once \naccepted as part of \nthe Judeo-Christian \ncanon of sacred \nscriptures but later elim- \ninated from the \nofficial canon. \n\n\n\nAss \n\nThe ass-god Pales had an extensive cult throughout the ancient \nworld. Palestine, Philistia, and the Palatine Hill in Rome were named \nfor Pales, who was both male and female. 1 \n\nThe Old Norse word Ass meant both "Asian" and "deity," \npossibly indicating that the divine ass originated in Asia. 2 The pre- \nVedic sacred king Ravana sported ten crowned human heads \nsurmounted by one ass head, symbolizing the spirit of the ass god \nincarnate in ten kings. 3 The long ears of the ass seem to have had the \nsame significance of virility in ancient India as the horns of the sacred \nbull or stag. 4 \n\nTacitus said the Jews worshipped the ass because wild asses were \nresponsible for their survival in the desert. 5 According to Genesis 36:24, \n\n\n\nCornelius Tacitus \n\nRoman historian \nand rhetorician, ca. \n56-120 a.d. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n\n\nAss \n\n\n\nPyramid Texts Col- \nlections of prayers, \nhymns, and magic \nspells inscribed on the \ninner walls of the \npyramids at Saqqarah \n(Sakkara), dating \nfrom the 5 th through \n7th dynasties. \n\n\n\nit was the tribal matriarch Anah, or Hannah, who first found asses in the \nwilderness. Balaam\'s oracular she-ass may have been a manifestation of \nthe spirit of Anah, as Balaam himself was another name for Baal. \nSamson slew the Philistines with an ass\'s jawbone, the same bone still \nregarded as a seat of the soul by some African tribes. 6 Jesus entered \nJerusalem on an ass\'s colt, symbol of the New Year. The lilim or \nChildren of Lilith were ass-haunched, for they were spirits left over \nfrom the real source of the Jewish ass-cult: Egypt, home of the ass- \nheaded god Set, or Seth. \n\nSet once ruled the dynastic gods, and in token of his sovereignty \ndisplayed a pair of ass\'s ears at the tip of a reed scepter. The Hyksos \nkings of Egypt revived Set\'s cult in the 2nd millenium B.C., perhaps \nbecause their own ass-eared Midas was a similar god-king. The annual \nalternation of Set and his brother Osiris (or Horus), who murdered each \nother in perpetual rivalry for the favors of Isis, reflected constant \nreplacement of sacred kings in pre-dynastic times. 7 \n\nAss-eared king Midas, a son of Cybele, died of drinking bull\'s \nblood. In other words, he was connected with the Taurobolium or bull- \nsacrifice made in honor of both Cybele and Isis. Midas has been \nidentified with Mita ("Seed"), a king of the Moschians or "calf-men," \nwho invaded the country of the Hittites from Thrace during the second \nmillenium B.C. Midas\'s Golden Touch and ass\'s ears link him with the \ncult of Set and the Golden Calf (Horus), whose image was worshipped \nby the Israelites (Exodus 32:2-4). \n\nUnder Egypt\'s Hyksos kings, Set was a god of the hot desert wind, \nknown as the Breath of the Ass. He was "Lord of the Chambers of the \nSouth," whence storm winds came. 8 His wind from the desert was \nsupposed to bring pestilence, i.e., typhus, derived from Set\'s Greek \nname, Typhon. This name was interlingual and world-wide. It meant \nboth the ass god and the wind called tufan in Arabic and Hindustani; t\'ai \nfung in Chinese; and tuffbon or Typhoon in the South Pacific. 9 \n\nAss-headed Set was a sacrificial deity in the cult of Horus and \nOsiris. He was crucified on a furka and wounded in the side. 10 He and \nHorus were represented as alternating year-gods who fought and \ncastrated one another, each being baptized in the blood of the other\'s \n"phallic eye," as the Pyramid Text said: "Horus is purified with the \nEye of his brother Set; Set is purified with the Eye of his brother \nHorus." n The Eye or phallus passed from one to the other. A statue \nof Horus at Coptos carried Set\'s severed phallus in his hand. 12 After \ncastrating Set, Horus spread his blood on the fields to render them \nfertile the usual fructification-by-male-blood found in the oldest sacri- \nficial Mysteries. 13 \n\nThus, Set and Horus were remnants of a primitive sacred-king \ncult, which the Jews adopted. The story of the rival gods appeared in \nthe Bible as Seth\'s supplanting of the sacrificed shepherd Abel, evidently \n\n\n\n68 \n\n\n\nthe same "Good Shepherd" as Osiris-Horus (Genesis 4:25). Their \nrivalry was resolved in Egypt by having the pharaoh unite both gods in \nhimself. Tomb paintings of Rameses IV showed him as both Set and \nHorus, two heads set upon one neck. 14 \n\nSimilarly, the Jewish God uniting both Father and Son was \nsometimes an ass-headed man crucified on a tree. This was one of the \nearliest representations of the Messiah\'s crucifixion. Some said Christ \nwas the same as the Jewish ass-god Iao, identified with Set. 15 Jews in \nRome were said to worship an ass\'s head as their deity. 16 \n\nThe Roman cult of the ass apparently originated in Libya, home of \nthe bisexual Pales, whose temple stood on the Palatine Hill and gave \nrise to the word "palace." 17 Servius said Pales was a Goddess, the Diva \nPalatua, a disguise of Vesta. Others said Pales was either a female \nprotectress of herd animals, or Vesta\'s male consort. In the first two \ncenturies a.d., Pales was worshipped as a priapic god at the festival of \nthe Palilia, traditional date of the founding of Rome, when the Palladi- \num was brought to Vesta\'s temple. 18 Priests of Pales wore ass-head \nmasks as they danced in honor of the long-eared deity. The Palilia was \ntaken into the Christian calendar as the Feast of St. George. One of \nits old customs may have given rise to the Halloween game of "Pin the \nTail on the Donkey," which recalls Rome\'s sacrifices of equine tails \ntriumphantly carried to the temple of Vesta. 19 \n\nI.

See Aladdin. \n\n\n\nAstarte \n\nLady of Byblos, one of the oldest forms of the Great Goddess in the \nMiddle East, identified with Egypt\'s Hathor, Mycenae\'s Demeter, \nCyprus\'s Aphrodite. \n\nHer shrine at Byblos dated back to the Neolithic and flourished \nthroughout the Bronze Age. 1 She was the same creating-preserving- \nand-destroying Goddess worshipped by all Indo-European cultures, and \nstill typified by Kali as the symbol of Nature. Astarte was the "true \nsovereign of the world," tirelessly creating and destroying, eliminating \n\n\n\nThe Bible calls her \nAsherah or Ashtoreth, \nthe Goddess wor- \nshipped by Solomon \n(1 Kings 11:5). \n\n\n\n69 \n\n\n\nAster \nAstraea \n\n\n\nTo the Arabs the \nGoddess was Athtar, \n"Venus in the \nMorning." In Aramaic \nshe was Attar-Sa- \nmayin, "Morning Star \nof Heaven," uniting \ntwo sexes in herself, like \nLucifer the Morning \nStar and Diana Luci- \nfera. Her Hurrian \nname was Attart, or \nsometimes Ishara, \nanother form of Ishtar, \n"the Star." 4 To Ca- \nnaanites, she was \nCelestial Ruler, Mis- \ntress of Kingship, \nmother of all baaJim \n(gods). 5 \n\n\n\nthe old and generating the new. 2 Sidonian kings could not rule \nwithout her permission. Each king styled himself first and foremost \n"Priest of Astarte." \n\nSumerian cylinder seals from Lagash, ca. 2300 B.C., showed the \nGoddess in a pose identical with Kali\'s love-and-death sacramental \nposture, squatting on top of her consort\'s body. 5 \n\nAstarte ruled all the spirits of the dead who lived in heaven wearing \nbodies of light, visible from earth as stars. Hence, she was known as \nAstroarche, "Queen of the Stars." 6 She was the mother of all souls in \nheaven, the Moon surrounded by her star-children, to whom she \ngave their "astral" (starry) bodies. Occultists still speak of the astral body \nas an invisible double, having forgotten the word\'s original connota- \ntion of starlight. 7 \n\nAstarte-Ashtoreth was transformed into a devil by Christian writ- \ners, who automatically assumed that any deity mentioned in the Bible \nother than Yahweh was one of the denizens of hell. She was also \nmasculinized. One finds in books of the 1 5th and 16th centuries a \ndemon Ashtoreth or Astaroth, a "duke" or "prince" of hell. 8 Milton \nknew better; he spoke of "Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent \nhorns." 9 \n\nScholars who really understood the mystery of Astarte recognized \nin her one of the ancient prototypes of the virgin Mary. In Syria and \nEgypt her sacred dramas celebrated the rebirth of the solar god from the \ncelestial Virgin each 25th of December. A newborn child was \nexhibited, while the cry went up that the Virgin had brought forth. \nFrazer says, "No doubt the Virgin who thus conceived and bore a \nson on the twenty-fifth of December was the great Oriental goddess \nwhom the Semites called the Heavenly Virgin or simply the Heavenly \nGoddess; in Semitic lands she was a form of Astarte." 10 \n\n1.

Like Minerva, Athene, Maat, and other \nmanifestations of the same Goddess, she was characterized as a celestial \nVirgin dispensing the fates of men. See Virgo. \n\n\n\nAstrology \n\n\n\nAstrology \n\nStudy of the stars has been called "the basis of all intellectual \nculture." \' It was highly refined by the Chaldeans, who were simulta- \nneously astronomers and astrologers. Unlike modern "Chaldeans," \nthey were moon worshippers, basing their system almost entirely on the \nmovements of the Moon-goddess. Their zodiac was known as \nHouses of the Moon. 2 \n\nApparently a majority of moon-watchers were women, the pries- \ntesses charged with determining correct seasons for planting and \nharvest, drawing up calendars, etc. Pliny said the study of the heavens, \nto foretell events such as eclipses, was traditionally the business of \nwomen. He suspected the priestesses\' magic didn\'t cause eclipses, but \nrather foresaw them by scientific measurements; yet "the most part \nof the common people have been and are of this opinion . . . that all the \nsame is done by enchantments, and that by the means of some \nsorceries and herbs together, both sun and moon may be charmed, and \nenforced both to loose and recover their light: to do which feat, \nwomen are thought to be more skilful and meet than men." He credited \nthe Goddesses Medea and Circe with special powers over the lights \nof heaven. 3 \n\nDivination by the lights of heaven was another particular province \nof the Moon-goddess and her sybils, the word cognate with the \nGoddess Cybele and possibly derived from Chaldean subultu, the \nCelestial Virgin (the constellation of Virgo). 4 An archaic term for \nastrological divination was mathesis, "the Learning," literally Mother- \nwisdom. Chaldean astrologers were Mathematici, "learned \nmothers." 5 \n\nAs a result of its ancient feminine associations, astrology was \nviewed as a devilish art by many fathers of the Christian church. \nSome thought it indistinguishable from witchcraft. Others respected it. \nOrigen said the stars are intelligent spirits, able to foresee the future \nand communicate their knowledge by their observed motions. St. \nThomas Aquinas agreed with this. He said man\'s fate is the power \nexerted by the stars in their movements. 6 \n\nSavonarola thought it a disgrace, however, that in his day the \nchurch was "wholly governed by astrology," as he said. Every \nimportant prelate had his "Chaldean" at his side, determining every \nmove by the stars. 7 St. Jerome said astrology was idolatry. Sts. Gregory, \nAmbrose, Chrysostom, Eusebius, and Lactantius all condemned it. \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, ex- \nerting a powerful \ninfluence on the early \nGreek church. At \nfirst he was accounted a \nsaint, but three cen- \nturies after his death he \nwas declared a here- \ntic because of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n\n\nAtalanta \n\n\n\nCouncil of Toledo \n\nThe greatest theological \nsignificance was at- \ntributed to the church \ncouncil held in Tole- \ndo in 675 a.d., though \nthere were seventeen \nother church councils in \nthe same city be- \ntween the 5 th and 8th \ncenturies. \n\nZodiacus Christianas \nA curious astrological \nwork claiming Jesuit \norigin. Full title: \nZodiacus Christianus \nlocupletatus seu \nSigna XII Divinae \nPraedestinationis. \nTotidem Symbolis ex- \nplicata ab Hierem \nDrexilio e Societatis \nJesu. \n\nPeter of Abano \n\n(1250-1318) Renais- \nsance scholar, \nphysician, geomancer, \nastrologer, and here- \ntic; an acquaintance of \nMarco Polo. \n\n\n\nSt. Augustine said astrology must be expelled from all Christian nations. \nIt was prohibited by the Council of Toledo. 8 \n\nDespite all this, the church took astrology to its bosom in the 12th \nand 1 3th centuries. Pope Julius II settled the date of his coronation on \nthe advice of astrologers. Pope Paul III planned the consistory by \nhoroscopes. Pope Leo X founded a chair of astrology in a major \nuniversity. 9 Signs of the zodiac were associated with the apostles. \nCathedrals were decorated with astrological symbols. The Zodiacus \nChristianus compared the zodiac to the stages of Christian life and the \ntwelve virtues. 10 \n\nPeter of Abano was one of the few unbelievers. He openly scoffed \nat God, and managed to avoid the Inquisition only by dying at an \nopportune moment. Toward the end, he remarked that he had devoted \nhis life to three noble arts: philosophy, which made him subtle; \nmedicine, which made him rich; and astrology, which made him a liar. 11 \n\nProtestants were not as enthusiastic about astrology as Catholics. \nQueen Elizabeth I of England disapproved of the Chaldean art, fearing \nimplications of treason against the royal person in prognosticating the \nlength of her life. Toward the latter part of her reign, she imposed \nsevere legal penalties for casting royal horoscopes. 12 Protestant leaflets \nlisted among the "sins of the papists" such as "Observation and choice \nof days, of planetary hours, of motions and courses of stars \n. . . horoscoping, or marking the hours of nativities, witchcrafts, en- \nchantments, and all such superstitious trumpery." 13 \n\nYet the common people retained many superstitious beliefs based \non astrology. The idea that the stars are souls in heaven never really \ndied out. English peasants were sure that a falling star denoted either a \nconception or a birth some said one, some said the other, for none \nwere clear about which moment the soul descended from heaven to \noccupy its new body. 14 Because it represented an essence of new life, \nthe falling star was and still is "wished on," like any spirit thought to be \npassing from one world to another. \n\n1.

Christian \ntheologians tended to regard atheism as devilish, though atheism im- \nplied disbelief in devils as well as all other supernatural entities. \n\nOriental thinkers were less simplistic about atheism. The more \nadvanced sages taught that non-belief can be more "religious" than \nbelief indeed, atheism may make better human beings than faith can \nmake. In the east "it is not thought impossible that atheism may be as \nprofoundly religious as theism, nor is atheism regarded by religious men \nas in itself unspiritual. This is extremely hard for a westerner to \nunderstand he does not see that the essence of religion lies in the \nreligious experience, and not in any belief at all, and that all so-called \nreligious beliefs or doctrines are merely theories about the religious \nexperience." \' \n\nEvans- Wentz called attention to the same Oriental thought: \n" The Fatherhood of God\' as a personal and anthropomorphic deity is \nthe cornerstone of Christian theology, but in Buddhism although \nthe Buddha neither denied nor affirmed the existence of a Supreme \nDeity it has no place, because, as the Buddha maintained, neither \nbelieving nor not believing in a Supreme God, but self-exertion in right- \ndoing, is essential to comprehending the true nature of life." 2 \n\nBy these standards, no criminal could be considered religious, no \nmatter how much faith he professed.

Oriental sages viewed theological \n\nmmmm ^ m j, mam ^^ reasoning with a certain contempt, as irrelevant to the behavior that \nconstitutes true religion: "Mere talk about religion is only an intellec- \ntual exercise. . . .

Though classic \nwriters insisted on her chastity, older traditions gave her several \nconsorts, such as Hephaestus and Pan. 1 She was united with the phallic \nPallas, whose "Palladium" was a lingam, later Rome\'s greatest fetish. 2 \n\nAthene came from North Africa. She was the Libyan Triple \nGoddess Neith, Metis, Medusa, Anath, or Ath-enna. An inscription \nat Larnax-Lapithou named her Athene in Greek, Anat in Phoenician. 3 \nPre-Hellenic myths said she came from the uterus of Lake Tritonis \n(Three Queens) in Libya. 4 Egyptians sometimes called Isis Athene, \nwhich meant "I have come from myself." 5 \n\nGreeks claimed Athene was born from Zeus\'s head, after he \nSign of Athene swallowed her mother Metis i.e., Medusa, "Female Wisdom," \n\nformerly symbolized by the Gorgoneum, Athene\'s snake-haired mask, \ninvested with power to turn men to stone. 6 Gorgo, or Gorgon, was \nAthene\'s Destroyer aspect. 7 Funerary statues or phallic pillars were her \n"men turned to stone," perhaps even identified with the pillars of the \nParthenon which was seized by Christians at an unknown date in \nthe 5th or 6th century a.d. and rededicated as a temple of the virgin \nMary. 8 \n\n1.

This was a re-interpreta- \ntion of his primary earth-supporting function. As Prometheus was \nassociated with the Caucasus and Heracles with the "Pillars of \nHeracles" in the west, so Atlas was associated with the Atlas Mountains \nof Africa indicating that the Titans were originally divine pillars of \nthe heavens, upholding the world. Atlas might be compared to the \n\n\n\n74 \n\n\n\nVedic god Vishnu who took the form of a tortoise (Greek Tartarus) Atonement \n\nand supported the world on his back. \n\n\n\nAtonement \n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia the Day of Atonement corresponded to the \nbeginning of the New Year, when all sins were collectively purged for a \nnew time-cycle. The Jews\' Yom Kippur, Day of Atonement, was \nbased on the Sumero-Babylonian kupparu, an atonement ceremony in \nwhich a sheep was ceremonially loaded with all the community\'s sins, \nand killed. The sheep was an animal substitute for the man who in \nearlier times died as Sin Bearer, Savior, or Good Shepherd that is, \nDumuzi or Tammuz. \n\nA ram played the part of Sin Bearer at atonement festivals of \nEgypt, which is why Aries the Ram is still the zodiacal sign of the \nNew Year that began in March, by ancient reckoning. Egyptians called \nhim Amon the ram god; the Jews assimilated him to the paschal lamb \nand sacrificed him at Passover. \n\nAll over the world, the sheep stood for the shepherd as an \natonement-victim. In China the name Ch\'iang, "Shepherd," was \ngiven to war prisoners who provided sacrificial victims. The pictograph \nfor "shepherd" was a man with a knife severing his neck. 1 The dead \nshepherd was also called the Son of God. In Samarkand during the 2nd \ncentury B.C., "the Son of God died with the seventh moon ... all the \ninhabitants, without distinction, appear dressed in robes of black wool. \nThey go barefooted, striking their breasts, uttering loud wails and \nweeping copious tears. Three hundred persons, both men and women, \ngo about the fields scattering grass, and looking for the remains of the \nSon of God." 2 Such was a Chinese traveler\'s impression of the rite \nknown in Greece as the anagnorisis, search and discovery (see \nDrama). \n\nIsrael\'s law called for a goat to bear away the sins of the community \nto the god Azazel, whom the Syrians called Aziz, "the Lord\'s \nMessenger." 3 Having selected the scape-goat, the priest would "confess \nover him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their \ntransgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat" \n(Leviticus 16:21). A first goat was driven away, a second one was \nkilled, for no god would absolve sins without an offering of blood: \n"Almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without \nshedding of blood there is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22). \n\nAs development of the wool industry made it more profitable \nto keep sheep alive for their fleeces than to kill them for their meat, the \ngoat became a more popular sacrificial victim. The animals were \nsometimes skinned to produce copious shedding of blood for remission \n\n\n\n75 \n\n\n\nAtonement of sins. An incantation from the Shurpu series gives a magic rationale \n\nfor flaying a scape-goat: \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ m As this goat skin is pulled off and thrown into the fire, and the burning \n\nFlame consumes it, and it does not return to its goat, and it is no longer \ndyed (with blood), so the oath, the ban, the pain, the misery, the disease, \nthe sickness, the trespass, the misdeed, the crime, the sin, the disease \nwhich dwells in my body, my flesh, and my joints, may they be pulled off \nlike this goat skin, and may the ban depart and may I see the light. 4 \n\nEarly Greek myths evoke primitive totemism with goat gods \nflayed in atonement for the sins of others. Athene flayed the goat god \nPallas, or Pan, and made her aegis from his skin. 5 Phrygians called \nthe same god the satyr Marsyas, nailed to a pine tree and flayed in \natonement for a crime against Apollo. In Rome, goats were flayed at \nthe purification festival of the Lupercalia, where the dying satyr-god \nFaunus was offered to the Sabine mother-goddess Ops. 6 \n\nThe old Roman New Year was celebrated at the Ides of March \nand called the Mamuralia, carrying another trace of scapegoat- \nsacrifice. A man dressed in goatskins was led through the city in \nprocession, beaten with rods, and driven away into exile with the \nformula, "Out with hunger, in with health and wealth." 7 Ovid said the \nMarch scapegoat was a legendary smith named Mamurius, who \nforged coins representing each month of the year zodiacal sun- \nsymbols. \n\nSuch practices make it clear that scapegoat-sacrifices were formerly \nhuman, and the animals replaced human victims. Liturgical formulae \nnearly always sent human sins into oblivion along with the sacrificed \nanimal. Egyptians, killing the bull that represented Osiris, said the \nwhole nation\'s sins were placed on his head. 8 Animal sacrifice took a \nmore humane form in Tibet: at the New Year ceremony, three \nhorses and three dogs were smeared with red paint instead of flayed, \nthen dedicated to the temple. 9 \n\nChristian symbolism made Jesus the sacrificial Lamb of God slain \n\nto atone for sin like the paschal lamb. Some early Christian writers \n\ninsisted that animal sacrifice came first, and human sacrifice was a later, \n\n"higher" development: "God is a man-eater. For this reason men are \n\nsacrificed to him." 10 Among medieval theologians there was a general \n\nopinion that Jesus\'s sacrifice was not really effective; only "a few" \n\nwere saved by the Savior\'s death. St. Thomas Aquinas and others \n\nclaimed the vast majority of people were still doomed to eternal \n\nsuffering in hell. 11 Thus the theory of atonement for all time or for all \n\nhumanity was actually denied by the same church that propounded \n\nit as a basis for worldly power. \n\n1.

She was \nthe Destroyer whose function was to cut the thread of life that the first \nsister spun, and the second one wove. She was usually depicted as an \nold woman carrying a pair of shears. Like Kali the Destroyer, she was \nalso worshipped as a Goddess in her own right. In Parthia, the \n"Virgin-Land," she had her own holy city, Atropatene. Its modern \nname is Azerbaijan. 1 \n\n\n\nl.Thc \n\n\n\n173. \n\n\n\nAtropos \nAttis \n\n\n\nAttis \n\nThe cult of Attis strongly influenced early Christianity. \n\nAttis accompanied Cybele, the Great Mother of the Gods, \nbrought to Rome from Phrygia in 204 B.C. They were established in a \ntemple on the Vatican hill, where they remained for six centuries. 1 At \nfirst Attis was separated from, and subordinated to, the Goddess, \nwhom the emperor Augustus regarded as the Supreme Mother of \nRome. "The Romans tolerated Attis because, maintaining the tradi- \ntion of earlier days, they continued to regard Cybele as a national \nGoddess." 2 \n\nAttis was a son of the Goddess\'s earthly incarnation, the virgin \nNana, who miraculously conceived him by eating an almond or a \npomegranate, yonic symbols both. Thus he was a typical "god without a \nfather," the Virgin\'s son. He grew up to become a sacrificial victim \nand Savior, slain to bring salvation to mankind. His body was eaten by \nhis worshippers in the form of bread. 3 He was resurrected as "The \nMost High God, who holds the universe together." 4 His epiphany was \nannounced with the words, "Hail, Bridegroom, Hail, new Light." 5 \nLike his priests he was castrated, then crucified on a pine tree, whence \nhis holy blood poured down to redeem the earth. \n\nAttis\'s passion was celebrated on the 25th of March, exactly nine \nmonths before the solstitial festival of his birth, the 25th of Decem- \nber. The time of his death was also the time of his conception, or \nre-conception. To mark the event when Attis entered his mother to \nbeget his reincarnation, his tree-phallus was carried into her sacred \ncavern. Thus the virgin mother Nana was actually the Goddess \nherself: she who was called Inanna by the Sumerians, Mari-Anna by the \nCanaanites, Anna Perenna by the Sabines, and Nanna, mother of the \ndying god Balder, in northern Europe. 6 \n\nChristians claimed the same dates for the conception and birth of \ntheir savior. The usual quarrels ensued. The Christians resorted to \ntheir favorite argument, that the devil had established pagan Mysteries \nin imitation of Christianity before there was a Christianity. Tertullian \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens Ter- \ntullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Car- \nthage of pagan parents. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n\n\nAttis said, "The devil by the mysteries of his idols, imitates even the main \n\nparts of the divine mysteries." 7 \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Followers of Attis eventually lost their sacrificial day to the Chris- \n\ntians. Justinian ruled that March 25 would be known as the day of \nthe Annunciation, or Lady Day. Naturally, the day of the Annunciation \nwas the day of Jesus\'s conception, so that he, like Attis, could be born \nnine months later at the winter solstice, as were all gods assimilated \nto the sun and called Light of the World. 8 \n\nMarch 25 was also the day when Blessed Virgin Juno miraculous- \nly conceived her savior-son Mars by eating her own magic lily, which \nis why March was named after this god and why medieval France called \nLady Day Notre Dame de Mars. The date was officially Christian- \nized by the tenth Council of Toledo in 656 a.d. as the Festival of the \nMother of God. But its symbol remained a pagan sign of the yoni. 9 \nMars had a Phrygian counterpart, the satyr Marsyas, likewise hung on a \ntree, and likewise a son of Cybele. It was said that he and Attis were \nthe same god. 10 \n\nThe day of Attis\'s death was Black Friday, or the Day of Blood. \nHis image was carried to the temple and bound to the tree, escorted \nby "reed-bearers" (cannophori) with the reed scepters representing re- \ngenerated phalli and new fertility. 11 During the ceremonies, initiates \ncastrated themselves in imitation of the castrated god, and presented \ntheir severed genitals to the Goddess along with those of the gelded \nbull sacrificed at the Taurobolium. 12 All these male remnants were \ndeposited in the sacred cave of the Great Mother. 15 \n\nThe god died and was buried. He descended into the underworld. \nOn the third day he rose again from the dead. His worshippers were \ntold: "The god is saved; and for you also will come salvation from your \ntrials." 14 This day was the Carnival or Hilaria, also known as the Day \nof Joy. People danced in the streets and went about in disguise, \nindulging in horseplay and casual love affairs. 15 This was the Sun- \nday; the god arose in glory as the solar deity of a new season. Christians \never afterward kept Easter Sunday with carnival processions derived \nfrom the mysteries of Attis. Like Christ, Attis arose when "the sun \nmakes the day for the first time longer than the night." 16 \n\nNaassenes of the 3rd century a.d. worshipped Attis as a syncretic \nmixture of deities. One of their hymns said, "Of Attis I will sing, of \nRhea\'s son, not sounding his praises with rolling drums, nor on the reed, \nnor with the roar of Ida\'s Curetes, but as the Muse of Phoebus on the \nlyre I will blend the strains. Euhoi, Euhan, he is Pan, he is Bacchus, he \nis the shepherd of the white constellations." 17 \n\nInscriptions of the 4th century gave Attis the title of Menotyrannus, \nfrom Greek tyrannos, "lord," plus Men or Mennu, Osiris as the \nresurrected, ithyphallic moon-bull, "the Lord Who Impregnates His \nMother." 18 \n\n\n\n78 \n\n\n\nPagans sometimes celebrated the Hilaria at the end of their Holy \nWeek, bringing it to April 1 and the carnival of the April Fool, or \nCarnival King, or Prince of Love, all originally synonymous with Attis. \nHe was also identified with Green George of the old Roman Palilia, \nhonored on Easter Monday with sacrificial hanging of the god\'s effigy \non a sacred tree. People of the 18th century still said the 25th of \nMarch used to be New Year\'s Day, while April 1 stood at the "octaves" \nterminating the sacred week. 19 \n\nSome Christians claimed Jesus\'s crucifixion took place on April 1, \nso the Fool of the April Fool\'s Day processions became Christ \ncarrying his cross and enduring the mockery of the mob. But the spring \nHoly Week was not really Christian. Its origin was a universal Indo- \nEuropean tradition of extreme antiquity, probably traceable to the Holi \nfestivals of India which celebrated the rebirth of spring with joyous \norgies. 20 \n\n1.

Oracles were augustae \nin the semi-matriarchal "republican" period. The term was later applied \nto male priests, then to emperors. An "august" man was one filled \nwith the spirit of the Goddess. 1 Augur, the old name for a seer, meant \n"increaser," once referring to the mother-priestess. 2 The first emper- \nor Augustus took his title from the Great Mother of the Gods, \npresumed incarnate in his wife Livia Augusta. Their house stood \nopposite the temple of the Great Mother, whom Augustus honored as \nthe national Goddess. 3 \n\nAmong European pagans the month of August began with one of \nthe Goddess\'s major festivals, Lammas Eve, from Hlaf-mass, "the \nFeast of Bread." The secret worship of Ops, Ceres, Demeter, or Juno \nAugusta continued throughout the Middle Ages in the rites ad- \ndressed to the Lammas corn-mother who ruled the harvest-month. \n"For a seventeenth-century Scot to say \'he (or she) was born in \nAugust\', was to imply high praise and recognition of a well-skilled \nperson\'. August, the month of the Lammas towers, the month when \nthe Irish dancers moved around the female effigy, was the right time for \nbirth. Then the Lammas moon was at work, on behalf of new \nchildren, and the new harvest." 4 \n\nChurchmen repeatedly tried to obliterate the Goddess\'s connec- \ntions with her harvest month.

Every god was a Baal. The title was introduced into Ireland \nvia Phoenician colonies in Spain, and became the Irish Bel or Bial, Lord \nofBeltain. 1 \n\nOld Testament Jews worshipped many baalim as past or present \nconsorts of the Goddess Zion (Hosea 2:2-8). Yahweh shared these other \ngods\' temples for a long time, until his priesthood managed to isolate his \ncult and suppress the others. 2 Some of the baalim revered in Israel \nwere: Sin, the moon god of Sinai; Molech (Melek), the "king" and sun \ngod of Tyre; Horus, the Egyptian Golden Calf whose image was \nmade by Aaron; Baal-Peor, a phallic "Lord of the Cleft" (or yoni); \nNehushtan, the "fiery flying serpent" of lightning, made by Moses (2 \nKings 18:4); Chemosh, the Babylonian sun god Shamash, incarnate in \nSamson (or Shams-on, the sun); Melchizedek, the god of Salem; \nEtana, or Ethan, the Canaanite Eytan who "went up to heaven"; Baal- \nRimmon, the Lord of the Pomegranate impersonated by Solomon; \nBaal-Berith, the Canaanites\' "God of the Covenant"; El, or Elias, the \nsun god Helios to whom Jesus called from the cross; Joseph, Jacob, \nand Israel, who were not men but tribal gods. 2 \n\nSince nearly all gods were sacrificial victims in their earthly \nincarnations, Baal may have been derived from Sanskrit Bala or Bali, \na sacrificial offering. 5 The Semitic melek, "king," came from Phoeni- \ncian molk, a votive offering, because early kings were not only gods \nbut also victims. 4 (See Kingship.) \n\nBaal was often used as the title of a mortal king, especially one \nwhose reign might be terminated by a ritual sacrifice. In the time of \nEsarhaddon of Assyria, the king of Tyre was named Baal, or "God." In \nthe 10th century B.C., kings of Byblos bore names like Yehimilk \n(God-king), Abibaal (Father-god), and Baalshamen (Heavenly Father). 5 \n\nBaal became a favorite Christian name for a devil, because biblical \nwriters denounced all the baalim indiscriminately as devils (2 Chroni- \ncles 1 1:15; 1 Corinthians 10:20; Revelation 9:20). Still, the northern \nEuropean cognate Bal, Bel, Bael, or Balder retained the affection of \ncommoners. 6 Baal was still the patron of the Beltain feast in 18th- \ncentury Scotland. To make the crops thrive, Scandinavians burned \nhis effigy at midsummer in "Balder\'s Balefires" throughout Denmark, \nNorway, and Sweden. 7 \n\n1. Joyce, 279. 2. Reinach, 201; Frazer,G.B., 341. 3.

Commandments on \n\nthe tablets were based on the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, received \n\nby the Babylonian king from the god Shamash. 1 These, in turn, were \n\nbased on the tablets of law given the first god by his Great Mother, \n\nTiamat. 2 \n\nThough both tablets and title were claimed by the Judeo-Christian \nGod, the name of Baal-Berith was attached to a devil, often invoked \nby medieval authors on magic, who were apparently unaware that they \ncalled upon the God of the Covenant. Weyer placed Baal-Berith in a \nposition suiting his ancient function, however. In the royal hierarchy of \nhell he was Minister of Treaties. 3 Though churchmen had small use \nfor the heretic Weyer, yet they used this precedent to assign the de- \nmonic pact to Baal-Berith. In 1335a witch named Catherine Delort \nwas burned for signing a pact with "the demon Berit." 4 \n\n1. Hooke, M.E.M* 142, 147. 2. Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 287. \n3. Waite, B.C.M., 186-87. 4. J.B.

Beelzebub \n\n\n\nBaal-Zebub \n\n"Lord of Flies," a god of Ekron in Philistia, to whose oracle King \nAhaziah of Israel sent messengers in quest of healing magic (2 Kings \n1:2). Like Hermes Psychopomp, his title meant the same as Lord of \nDeath or Conductor of Souls, because flies were common forms taken \nby souls in search of rebirth. Mothers of many mythic heroes \nmiraculously conceived them by swallowing their souls in fly shape. 1 \nEtain, legendary Irish queen married to Ochy Airem, and Cu \nChulainn are examples from popular Celtic myth. \n\nThe Pharisees called Baal-Zebub a "prince of devils," apparently \nbecause it was thought he could cure people possessed by lesser devils \n(Matthew 12:24). One or two passing references to this "prince of \ndevils" in the New Testament sufficed to establish Beelzebub as an \nalternative name for Satan, and flies as diabolic manifestations in \nmedieval Christendom. \n\nSt. Bernard once exorcised a cloud of flies, which instantly \ndropped dead at the sound of his holy words and had to be shoveled \nout of his church in heaps. 2 \n\nFly-devils were still firmly believed in during the late 16th century. \nWhen a young Viennese girl suffered from cramps in 1 583, Jesuit \npriests diagnosed her case as demonic possession.

The ziggurat restored by \nNebuchadnezzar was a "temple of the seven spheres of the world." It \nhelped established universal belief in the seven heavens, corresponding \nto the seven planetary spheres. Christians and Moslems also adopted \nthis view of the cosmos. The Koran says Allah made seven heavens and \nseven underground spheres, the seven hells. 4 \n\nWhen ziggurats were abandoned and became ruinous, their mud- \nbrick construction crumbling, later nomadic peoples assumed the \ngods were angered by the pride of the elder races and broke down their \nheaven-aspiring constructions. The Babel myth is found all over the \nworld, including India and Mexico. It was familiar in the Greek story of \nthe giants who piled up mountains to reach heaven. Hindus said it \nwas not a tower but a great tree that grew up to heaven, angering \nBrahma, who cut off its branches and threw them down. From each \nbranch grew a separate wata tree that gave humanity another separate \nlanguage. 5 \n\nBerossus said the Babylonian heaven-mountain was destroyed by \nwinds, which blew a diversity of tongues among men. The first part \nof this premise was certainly not irrational, since drying and wind- \nerosion were major causes of the destruction of mud-brick structures. \nBerossus\'s story surfaced many centuries later in the Armenian myth of \nthe holy mountain built by giants. It was blown down by winds, while \n"unknown words were at the same time blown about among men." 6 \n\nThe same story was told in the western hemisphere. Choctaw \nIndians said their own ancestors piled up stones to build a mountain \nthat would reach heaven, but it was blown down by winds, whereupon \npeople found themselves speaking different languages. 7 In Central \nAmerica the heaven-reaching pyramid of Cholula was built by giants un- \nder the leadership of Xelhua. The angry gods broke it down with light- \nning and sent different, mutually incomprehensible languages to earth. 8 \n\n1. White 2, 170. 2.Hcx)ke,M.E.M., 138. 3. Eliade, M.E.R., 14. \n4.

Sometimes \nthey were ordinary \ncakes marked with a \nsymbol of the sacrifice, \nlike the Christian \nhost (from Latin hostia, \n"victim"). \n\n\n\nBalder \n\nNorwegian name for the god Bel, or Baal, sacrificed as a son of \nFather Odin. He descended into the womb of Mother Hel, the \nUnderworld. At doomsday, Ragnarok, he would return to earth in \nSecond Coming. He would establish a new earth and a new heaven \nafter the passing of the old destructive gods and their world. \n\nBalder\'s effigy is still burned at Beltain fires in Scotland and \nIreland. Scandinavians knew them as Balder\'s Balefires. His was the \nspirit inhabiting the Beltain cake, an effigy of god-flesh like the Christian \nhost, sometimes man-shaped like the symbolic dough "victims" of \nthe Far East. 1 Such pagan hosts probably gave rise to the living \nGingerbread Man of the fairy tale. 2 \n\nLike Heracles, Siegfried, and other solar heros, Balder stood for \nthe idea of regeneration through cremation. His funeral was the \nViking\'s dissolution in both fire and water; he was sent to sea on a \nburning ship. This was arranged by a Goddess called Hyrrokkin, \n"Fire-shrunk," one of the Elder Deities.

"When the banshee \nloves those she calls, the song is a low, soft chant giving notice, \nindeed, of the proximity of death but with a tenderness of tone that \nreassures the one destined to die and comforts the survivors; rather a \nwelcome than a warning." 4 To others, she came like a bad death, full of \nhorror. \n\n1.

Shah, 225.2. Knight, S.L., 202. \n\n\n\nBaptism \n\nIn 418 a.d., a Catholic church council decided that every human \nchild is born demonic as a result of its sexual conception, thus automati- \ncally damned unless baptized. 1 During a Catholic baptismal \nceremony the priest still addresses the baby, "I exorcise thee, thou \nunclean spirit. . . . Hear thy doom, O Devil accursed, Satan ac- \ncursed!" 2 The exorcism is euphemistically described as "a means to \nremove impediments to grace resulting from the effects of original sin \nand the power of Satan over fallen nature." 3 But it is obvious from the \nfolk belief still widespread, that the church\'s teaching was that every \nnewborn infant before baptism belonged to the devil. 4 St. Augustine\'s \ndoctrine of original sin laid the foundation for this idea, and Tertul- \nlian said every baby is born evil; its soul is "unclean" and "actively \nsinful" before baptism. 5 Medieval theologians held that any infant still \nin the womb is doomed to eternal damnation. 6 The Oedipal jealousies \nof men apparently developed these ideas, since few women would \nhave pictured babies screaming in an eternity of torture in hellfire, \nsimply because no priest had sprinkled them with water before they \nperished. \n\nIndeed, priests refused to baptize a child within forty days of its \nbirth, for both mother and infant were considered impure (hence too \ndangerous for priests to touch) during that period. "An unbaptized \nchild, as well as a woman between childbirth and churching, was \ndesignated as heathen." 7 The real reason for this "heathenism" appears \nin numerous folk beliefs: it was the birth magic of the ancient \nGoddess that claimed both women and their infants in the performance \nof her Mysteries. In the north it is still said that children dying \nunbaptized go to Frau Holda, or Hel, or Perchta, the underground \nMother. 8 In the Hebrides, the Goddess\'s protective ritual is still used \nto preserve children during the perilous pre-baptismal period: a torch is \ndaily carried around the cradle as in old pre-Christian custom. 9 Some \ntraditional ballads deny the Catholic doctrine that women dying in \nchildbed or infants dying unbaptized must go to hell; they claim, \nrather, that such individuals pass into a pagan heaven. Mexican peasants \nstill say they go to "a place of delight in the temple of the sun." 10 \n\nThus, paganism was kinder to infants and their mothers than \nChristianity, so that theologians often felt called upon to explain \nGod\'s apparent cruelty in allowing infants to die unbaptized, so con- \ndemning them before they had a chance for salvation. In the 16th \nand 17th centuries, churchmen insisted that God\'s cruelty was perfectly \njust. Said Martin Del Rio, S.J.: "If, as is not uncommon, God permits \n\n\n\n90 \n\n\n\nchildren to be killed before they have been baptized, it is to prevent their Barabbas \n\ncommitting in later life those sins which would make their damnation Barbara, Saint \n\nmore severe. In this, God is neither cruel nor unjust, since, by the mere ^^^^^^^^^^ \nfact of original sin, the children have already merited death." n \n\nIt was customary to refuse baptism altogether to those thought to \nhave been conceived out of wedlock, or sinfully. American church- \nmen often refused to baptize children born on Sunday, because it was \nthought children were always born on the same day of the week as \ntheir conception, and marital relations on Sunday were forbidden. 12 \n\nModern theologians have trouble explaining why baptism should \nbe necessary. Few educated parents seriously believe their infants are \ndoomed to eternal torture unless splashed with a little water in a church. \nThe biblical "fall" that provided the original rationale has long since \nbeen relegated to the realm of myth. 13 The primitive notion of the \npublic name-giving ritual seems to be all that is left to justify the \nformalities: no more than an excuse for people to dress up and get \ntogether, to celebrate a new life in the clan. Perhaps it should be \nremembered that this function was once the exclusive concern of \nmothers and Goddesses. \n\n1. H. Smith, 238. 2. de Givry, 157. 3. Encyc. Brit, "Exorcism." \n4.

Within the mountain dwelt the \nheathen dead, "bewitched men and women" who spent their time in \ndancing, lovemaking, and other pleasures until the day of doom. 1 In \nother words, St. Barbara was none other than the Fairy Queen. \n\nAs a spurious martyr, Barbara followed the usual pattern: she was a \nbeautiful virgin, tortured by her evil pagan father to make her \nrenounce Christianity. She remained steadfast, so her father killed her. \nThen God struck the father dead with a lightning bolt, unfortunately \na few minutes too late to save Barbara.

He was inserted into the Gospels as an apostle, but hagiogra- \nphers gave him a different origin. He was called a son of "Prince \nPtolomeus," crucified in Armenia, and flayed like the satyr Marsyas (see \nMars). Icons showed him holding a moon-sickle, the sacrificial knife \nof the Middle East. 1 \n\nAn alternative history made Bartholomew a missionary to India, \nwhere he overthrew the idols of the oddly non-Indian deities Astarte \nand Baal-Berith. With many miracles, Bartholomew converted the \nking of that country to Christianity, but the king\'s brother was \nunaccountably permitted to crucify, flay, and behead the saint \nafterward. 2 \n\nSpurious relics of the saint were installed in the Roman healing \nshrine of Asclepius, which was taken over by Christians and remained \nthe Hospital of San Bartolommeo up to the 20th century.* \n\n1.

As the serpent-haired \nGorgon head represented women\'s "wise blood" and guarded men- \nstrual mysteries that men were forbidden to behold, so there was a \npopular medieval belief that a hair taken from the head of a menstru- \nating woman and buried in the earth would turn into a serpent or \nbasilisk. 1 Superstitious folk supposed that all the serpents on the \nGorgon\'s head were basilisks, which derived their evil eyes from her \nown deadly glance. \n\nl.Rawson.A.T., 165-66. \n\n\n\nBassareus \n\nLydian fox god, a totemic form of Orpheus or Dionysus, whose \nMaenads were sometimes called Bassarids because they wore fox \n\n\n\n92 \n\n\n\nskins. 1 As a pagan deity, the fox became the popular trickster-hero of \nmedieval folklore, where he appeared as Reynard or Renaud.

Herodotus said that in Egypt, "All cats that die are \ncarried to certain sacred houses, where being first embalmed, they are \nburied in the city of Bubastis." \' The Greeks identified Bast with \nArtemis or Diana, also called the mother of cats, and claimed the great \nshrine of Bubastis was built in her honor. 2 The cat\'s legendary nine \nlives stemmed from Artemis as the mother of the nine Muses, corre- \nsponding to the Egyptian Ennead of nine primordial deities.

In Rome, each paterfamilias went \nthrough an annual ceremony of exorcising ancestral spirits by throwing \nbeans behind him at midnight, nine times enjoining the manes to \nleave the house. 2 \n\nAnother Roman ceremony on the twelfth day after the midwinter \nsolstice (Epiphany) recalled ancient customs of choosing a sacred \nking. It was called the Festival of Kings Created or Elected by Beans, \nthe beans evidently representing women, the choosing carried out by \ndrawing black or white beans. Later, dice were used, and a ceremonial \nking-for-the-night called Basilicus was chosen by the "Venus" throw. \nThe ceremony persisted in medieval England, where the Twelfth- \nNight plum cake contained one bean, and the man who received the \nbean was declared king of the festival. 3 \n\nSome overlapping esoteric meanings of beans may be found in the \nSanskrit word mudra, "kidney beans," also "woman," and a "magical \ngesture," the benevolent spell cast by a Shakti. 4 The influx of Tantric \nsymbols into medieval Europe probably gave rise to Jack\'s beanstalk, \nresembling the Ladder of Heaven in that it was a soul-bridge: "the myth \n\n\n\n93 \n\n\n\nBeata of the vine that once joined earth and sky," in the paradisal time \n\nBehemoth when men knew the way to heaven or thought they did. 5 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ 1.

Sometimes \nthey were persecuted for heresy and witchcraft. \n\n\n\nBeelzebub \n\nSee Baal-zebub. \n\nBehemoth \n\nBiblical name of the Indian elephant god Ganesha, the "Lord of \nHosts." \' His title was adopted by the Jewish Jehovah, during the period \nwhen he was married to the Virgin Goddess Anath, or Neith, in the \ntemple of Elephantine in Egypt. Jewish mercenaries stationed there wor- \nshipped the elephant-headed, virgin-born Lord of Hosts as their own \nYaho (or, Yahweh). 2 At the time, the Jewish God was a subordinate \nspouse of the Goddess who was hailed as "Queen of Heaven and \nmistress of all the gods." 3 \n\nThe same Virgin Goddess was the mother, as well as the bride, of \nthe elephant bull-god, according to the standard myth of divine incest \ncreated by identification of Father and Son. In India the mother of \nGanesha was Parvati, virgin form of Kali. She made him from her \nown "body-dew" (menstrual blood). A true archetypal son, he guarded \nher "gate" (yoni) against the entrance of All-father Shiva. For this \nOedipal offense he was slain, but resurrected. 4 Upon the same virgin \nmother under her other name of Maya (comparable to Mari, the \nother name of Anath), he begot the next incarnation of the Son of the \nLord of Hosts: Buddha, the Enlightened One. \n\nThe elephant-god was not forgotten by the Jews, but he was \ndissociated from the later concept of Yahweh, and diabolized. He \nbecame the demon Behemoth. In this guise he appeared in medieval \ndemonologies and grimoires, still wearing the elephant head of Shiva- \nGanesha. 5 \n\nYet traces of the earlier divine elephant could be found in Jewish \ntradition. Rabbinical sources said the Passover feast commemorated \nmore than one god. The lamb stood for the Firstborn. The fish \nrepresented Leviathan, the original wise serpent-deity of Levites. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n\n\nThe hard-boiled egg represented Ziz, or Aziz, or Azazel, the god of \natonement sacrifices.

Through \nwearing the bear\'s skin, a warrior acquired the bear\'s fighting spirit \nand the grace of the ursine Goddess who was often a teacher of the \nmartial arts. "Berserk" came to mean one possessed by battle-frenzy, \ncareless of his own safety, unable to feel fear. \n\nTotemic descent from the She-Bear characterized several old \nEuropean clans. The Orsini or Ursini family were "bear\'s children," \ncarrying a bear on their coat of arms. William of Auvergne, bishop of \nParis in the 16th century, solemnly explained the origin of the Orsinis \nby saying a bear\'s semen is very like a man\'s, therefore it was quite \npossible for a bear to beget human children, presumably on a human \n\n\n\n95 \n\n\n\nBible mother. 1 The story reflects contemporary theological opinion that only \n\na male can be a true parent. Nothing was said about a she-bear\'s \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m ovum being like a woman\'s, nor was there a human father who might \nhave begotten children on a bear mother. \n\n1. Summers, W, 243. \n\n\n\nBible \n\nThis word for a holy book came from Byblos, the City of the Great \nMother, the oldest continuously occupied temple in the world. The \nGoddess called Astarte, Baalat, Hathor, etc. patronized learning, \nand her priestesses collected a library of papyrus scrolls. Therefore, \nGreeks called any papyrus byblos, which came to mean any holy \nbook. Hence the "Bible." \' \n\nScholars have found in the Bible\'s numerous layers of additions \nand corrections a substrate of the former Semitic matriarchy, such as \nthe Book of Ruth with its matrilineal and matrilocal marriage customs, \nand the Book of Judges with its feminine government of Israel \n(Judges 4:4). In several books the word translated "God" is really a \nfeminine plural, "Goddesses," especially in reference to the matriar- \nchal functions of lawgiving, avenging crimes, and bestowing the \nimperium of leadership. 2 \n\nSome of the miracles attributed to biblical heroes were copied from \nolder myths of the Goddess. Joshua\'s arrest of the sun was formerly \ncredited to priestesses of Isis, Hecate, and the Thessalian Great Mother, \nwho were said to stop heavenly bodies in their courses, and lengthen \nnight or day at will. 3 Moses\'s flowering rod, river of blood, and tablets of \nthe law were all symbols of the ancient Goddess. His miracle of \ndrawing water from a rock was first performed by Mother Rhea after she \ngave birth to Zeus, and by Atalanta with the help of Artemis. 4 His \nmiracle of drying up waters to travel dry-shod was earlier performed by \nIsis, or Hathor, on her way to Byblos. 5 \n\nThe greatest mistake of religious authorities in the western \nworld was their view of the Bible as intrinsically different from other \nancient scriptures, in that it was dictated word for word by God, not \ncollected slowly, rewritten and mis-written, revised and worked over by \nhuman beings for a long time. The notion that the Bible did not \nevolve haphazardly, like most other holy writings of the same period, \npersisted almost up to the present day, even among people who \nshould have known better. \n\nAccording to the prevailing myth of biblical origins, the Old \nTestament was supposed to have been translated from Hebrew to \nGreek by seventy-two translators sent to Ptolemy by Eleazar, a Jewish \nhigh priest, in the 3rd century B.C., hence its name, Septuagint. \nPtolemy locked the scholars in individual cells on the island Pharos, \nwhere each one made his own Greek version in exactly seventy-two \n\n\n\n96 \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndays. Each translation agreed exactly, in every word, with the other \nseventy-one translations. \n\nOf course this never happened. The Bible\'s real history was far less \ntidy. A collection appeared in the first century b.c. and again in the \nfirst century a.d. to be accepted by the Jews of the Diaspora as sacred, \nand passed on to Christians. In both Jewish and Christian hands the \npapyri underwent many changes. In the 4th century a.d., St. Jerome \ncollected some Hebrew manuscripts and edited them to produce the \nLatin Vulgate, a Bible of considerable inaccuracy, differing markedly \nfrom Jerome\'s stem texts. \n\nThe King James Bible relied mostly on a Greek text collected and \nedited by Erasmus in the 16th century, which in turn relied on a \nByzantine collection assembled gradually at Constantinople between \nthe 4th and 8th centuries. A few older texts have been discovered: the \nCodex Sinaiticus, the Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Alexandrinus, and \nthe Chester Beatty papyri. All are fragmentary, all differ from one \nanother and from the King James version. There are no known portions \nof the Bible older than the 4th century a.d. 6 \n\nThe Revised Version of the New Testament published in 1881 \ntried to correct some of the more glaring errors. It erased the spurious \nfinal twelve verses of Mark, which were late interpolations including the \nwords that caused centuries of suffering: "He that believeth not shall \nbe damned." It eliminated the fraudulent translation "Joseph and his \nmother," intended to preserve the dogma of the virgin birth, and \nrestored the original "his father and his mother." It omitted the forged \ninterpolation intended to preserve the dogma of the trinity: "For \nthere are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and \nthe Holy Ghost: and these three are one." These words appeared \nnowhere before the 1 5th century a.d. However, the Catholic church \ninsisted on retaining the forgery. Churchmen\'s argument was: "How, \nif these verses were an interpolation, could the Holy Spirit, who guides \nand directs the Church, have allowed her to regard this lofty affirma- \ntion of the Trinity as authentic, and permitted its insertion in the official \nedition of the sacred books?" In 1897 the Congregation of the Index, \nwith the approval of Pope Leo XIII, forbade any further research into \nthe origins of this text. 7 \n\nTraditionally, the church forbade not only research but even \nreading of the Bible by laymen. Throughout the Middle Ages, \npossession of a Bible written in the vernacular was a crime punished by \nburning at the stake. 8 With the Reformation came Bible-reading in \nsearch of a new basis for faith; but in the process were found many new \ngrounds for skepticism. \n\nRichard Simon\'s 17th-century Critical History of the Old Testa- \nment exhibited the now well-known internal evidence that the books \nof Moses were not written by Moses but were compiled by many hands \nat a much later date. Bishop Bossuet pronounced this work of \nscholarship "a mass of impieties," drove its author out of the Oratory, \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\n97 \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\nMaurice Jones \n\nAuthor of The New \nTestament in the \nTwentieth Century, \n1934. \n\n\n\nand ordered the entire first edition burned. Dr. Alexander Geddes, a \nCatholic scholar, translated the Old Testament in 1792 with a critical \nvolume proving that the Pentateuch could not have been written by \nMoses, nor at any time prior to the reign of David. He was denounced \nas "a would-be corrector of the Holy Ghost." 9 \n\nAs the years passed, it became increasingly clear that the Holy \nGhost needed correcting. Seven clerical scholars published Essays \nand Reviews in 1860, defining the new science of Bible criticism. They \nwere denounced, and two were suspended from office; but they took \ntheir case to court, and won. In 1 869 Kuenen\'s The Religion of Israel \nestablished Bible criticism as a valid field of investigation. He was \nfollowed by many others in Holland, Germany, and France. In 1889 \nthe book of biblical essays called Lux Mundi gave up all pretense of \nthe scriptures\' historicity or divine inspiration, admitting that the Bible is \na confused mass of myth, legend, and garbled history, often contra- \ndicting provable facts. 10 \n\nNaturally, there was constant opposition to the efforts of the \nscholars. Many 19th-century churchmen insisted that the Bible\'s only \nauthor was God. Dean Burgon said, "The Bible is the very utterance of \nthe Eternal; as much God\'s own word as if high heaven were open \nand we heard God speaking to us with human voice. Every book is in- \nspired alike, and is inspired entirely." Dr. Baylee said the Bible is \n"infallibly accurate; all its histories and narrations of every kind are \nwithout any inaccuracy." Dr. Hodge declared that the books of the \nBible are "one and all, in thought and verbal expression, in substance, \nand in form, wholly the work of God, conveying with absolute \naccuracy and divine authority all that God meant to convey without \nhuman additions and admixtures." 11 Apparently none of these gen- \ntlemen were familiar with the earlier contradictory texts; nor had they \nread the Bible closely enough to see the many passages where God \ncontradicted himself. \n\nThe real point was that organized religions had an economic \ninterest in maintaining literal interpretation of biblical myths. Guigne- \nbert says, "The doctrine of the inerrancy of the Bible . . . necessarily \nplaced theology in an attitude of surly and sanguinary hostility toward \nthe exact and experimental sciences, which it will not abandon save \nmost reluctantly and after as much delay as possible. . . . [Mjethods \nhave changed, the illusions still current have decreased, but its spirit is \nscarcely altered." 12 \n\nWhen the theologians began to give in, they complained that \nviewing the Bible as myth would destroy the whole structure that \ntheir livelihood and self-respect depended on. After David Straus\'s \nLebenjesu disposed of the historicity of the Gospel stories, and \nRenan\'s Vie de Jesus showed that the Gospels cannot be taken as literal \ntruth but only as romantic symbolism, the Rev. Maurice Jones \nexclaimed, "If the Christ-Myth theory is true, and if Jesus never lived, \n\n\n\n98 \n\n\n\nthe whole civilized world has for close upon two thousand years lain Bible \n\nunder the spell of a lie." 13 The Archbishop of Canterbury found it \nimpossible to deny the Bible\'s apparent lies, and began to backtrack _. \n\nwith his plaintive question, "May not the Holy Spirit make use of myth \nand legend?" 14 \n\nObviously the Bible was full of myths and legends, but most \northodox theologians had no idea of their meaning. One reason was \nthat they didn\'t study the corresponding myths and legends of other \ncultures ancient paganism, modern mysticism, the non-Christian \nbeliefs of people both civilized and uncivilized throughout the rest of \nthe world. Christian missionaries thought theirs was the only pipeline \nto divinity, the deities of all other people throughout the world were \ndevils, and the myths of the Bible were absolutely true whereas all \nother myths were absolutely false. \n\nNowadays such crude beliefs seem no less superstitious than the \nprimitive animisnvthat the missionaries sought to destroy. Yet an \neven darker blot on the history of Christian missions was their arrogant \nvandalism burning books and artworks, smashing images, forbid- \nding the songs and poems of heathen tradition instead of listening and \nrecording them in order to understand the people, to display a decent \nrespect for what alien races held sacred, as the pagan Romans did in the \ndays of their empire. It may well have been that, had the missionaries \nbeen willing to listen and learn, they would have discovered the \nmythology of the Bible all over again in other offshoots from its \noriginal sources; for all peoples, nearly everywhere in the world, shared \nthe same fables of the creation, the flood, the magic garden with its \ntree of life and its primal couple, the wise serpent, the heaven-piercing \ntower, the divided waters, the chosen people, the virgin mothers, the \nsaviors, and all the rest. It has been said both testaments of the Bible are \nonly recent and relatively corrupt derivations from a world-wide cycle \nof archetypal myths. 15 \n\nLeast of all were righteous Christians prepared to understand \nthat their awe of the Bible rested on a foundation of magical supersti- \ntion: it was, and is, a fetish. Legal oaths were taken in physical contact \nwith a Bible because of a very primitive belief in its destructive mana, \nwhich would automatically punish perjurors. Both Jews and Chris- \ntians used their Bible for divination, just as a witch might use a crystal \nball, an African might use a thunder-stone, or a Roman augur might \nuse the sacred chickens. Bibliomancy (taking omens from the Bible) was \nsometimes deplored, but from the 4th to the 14th centuries was \n"repeatedly practiced by Kings, Bishops, and Saints." 16 St. Augustine \nfrankly recommended taking omens from the Bible "in all cases of \nspiritual difficulty." 17 Even in this "enlightened" age, in both Europe \nand America, the Bible is still used to give omens. 18 \n\nA favorite biblical method for discovering a thief easily lent itself to \nconscious legerdemain. The name of the accused was written on a \n\n\n\n99 \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\nRobert Ingersoll \n\n(1833-1899) American \nlawyer and lecturer, \nAttorney General of the \nstate of Illinois; an \noutspoken popularizer \nof Bible criticism. \n\nJosephine Henry \n\n19th-century Kentucky \nsuffragist and pam- \nphleteer, active in the \nwomen\'s rights \nmovement. \n\nElizabeth Cady \n\nStanton (1815-1902) \nOne of the leaders of \nthe women\'s rights \nmovement in the \nU.S.; an associate of \nSusan B.

The diviner recited Psalm 50:18: "When thou \nsawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker \nwith adulterers." The guilt of the accused was proven if the key was \nfound turned around afterward. 19 \n\nDespite the many discoveries and clarifications made by biblical \nscholars in the last century or so, the average Christian\'s attitude \ntoward the Bible is still hardly more sophisticated than this simple- \nminded magic. Most churchmen see to it that their congregations are \nnot told the true origins of biblical myths. The most primitive or \nunattractive of these are constantly re-interpreted as deep allegories \nor metaphorical fables, intended by their divine author to wait two \nthousand years or more for a correct explanation. Yet the real \nexplanation of the sources of these stories, uncovered by the careful \nresearches of the higher critics, is seldom mentioned. Likewise \nignored are many of the truly awkward passages such as "Thou shalt not \nsuffer a witch to live," or God\'s frequent commands to wage \nmerciless war, which no amount of exegesis can fit into a more tolerant \nethic. 20 \n\nErroneous but traditional views of Bible origins and meanings are \ndoggedly preserved by male chauvinists in particular, since the \ncanonical books were deliberately selected and edited to wipe out all \nfeminine images of divinity and sanction religious suppression of \nwomen. Robert Ingersoll pointed out that "As long as woman regards \nthe Bible as the charter of her rights, she will be the slave of man." Jo- \nsephine Henry grumbled, "The Bible records that God created woman \nby a method different from that employed in bringing into life any \nother creature, then cursed her for seeking knowledge." Elizabeth \nStanton said there is no escape from the Bible\'s "degrading teaching" \nas to the position of women, and advised women to boycott churches. \n"It is not commendable for women to get up fairs and donation \nparties for churches in which the gifted of their sex may neither pray, \npreach, share in the offices and honors, nor have a voice in the \nbusiness affairs, creeds and discipline, and from whose altars come forth \nBiblical interpretations in favor of woman\'s subjection." 21 \n\nOne of the erroneous notions that still keep Christian women \nshackled to their Bible-based "inferior" image is the notion that \nChristianity was founded on the New Testament, when in fact the early \nchurches had no Gospels but rather created and produced their \nown. 22 Not only did churchmen falsely pretend an apostolic origin for \ntheir scriptures; they also weeded out all references to female author- \nity or participation in Christian origins. 23 Only the forbidden Gnostic \nGospels retained hints that Jesus had 12 female disciples correspond- \ning to the 12 male disciples, or that Mary Magdalene was the leader of \nthem all. Even women\'s scholarship was denied. St. Jerome openly \nadmitted that his co-authors of the Vulgate were two learned women; \n\n\n\n100 \n\n\n\nbut later scholars erased the women\'s names and substituted the \nwords "venerable brothers." 24 \n\nl.Encyc.Brit, "Byblos." 2.

Latin aves meant both "birds" \nand "ancestral spirits," or ghosts, or angels. Roman emperors \nachieved godhood in the form of an eagle which was released above an \nemperor\'s funeral pyre to carry his soul to heaven. 1 Similarly, an \nEgyptian pharaoh\'s spirit rode aloft, on, or in, the solar hawk of Horus \nreleased at his funeral. Like Phoenix, he passed through the Fire and \nwas reborn with wings. Based on such prototypes, the souls of Christian \nsaints ascended to heaven in the form of white doves released at the \ncanonization ceremony. 2 \n\nBecoming a bird in a visionary or trance state was a widespread \nsymbol of initiatory death and rebirth. Shamans and prophets in the \nSouth Pacific, Indonesia, Central Asia, and Siberia claimed to transform \nthemselves into birds. Buddhist yogis said ecstatic flight was the first \nmagical power to be developed by the practice of yoga. "Becoming a \nbird oneself or being accompanied by a bird indicates the capacity, \nwhile still alive, to undertake the ecstatic journey to the sky and \nbeyond." 3 Celtic "fays" or "fairies" could change themselves into \nbirds, which is why they were depicted with wings like angels, and why \nwitches "flew" to the Sabbat. 4 \n\nThe Chinese said women knew the secret of flying before men \ndid. The emperor Shun first learned it from two princesses. "Down \nto a certain date the source of magical power lay in women ... an \nindication of an ancient Chinese matriarchy." In northern Europe \nalso, the Goddess Freya owned all the magic feather garments that \nenabled magicians to fly through the air like birds. 5 The elaborate \nfeather garments of Mayan and Aztec priesthoods probably had the \nsame original function, to facilitate their soul-flights. \n\nBecause birds traveled freely between the earthly and heavenly \nrealms, they were everywhere regarded as angelic messengers, givers \nof omens, possessors of occult secrets, as well as soul-carriers. Carrion \ncrows and vultures took souls to heaven. Storks brought them back to \nearth for rebirth. Wise owls told the secrets of the night; lustful doves \nand nightingales told the secrets of love. Angelic eagles foretold the \nfuture. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n\n\nBirds \n\n\n\nPhilo Judaeus (ca. 30 \nB.c-40 a.d.) Alexandrian \nJewish philosopher, \nstrongly influenced by \nHellenistic Platonism, \nPythagoreanism, and \nStoicism; author of \nbiblical commentaries, \ntracts, and histories. \n\n\n\nMyths repeatedly credit seers with power to understand the lan- \nguage of birds, usually because sacred serpents licked their ears to \n"open" them, as in the case of the Trojan prophetess Cassandra. 6 \nSiegfried likewise obtained the power to understand birds, via the \nmagic blood of the Great Serpent or dragon. A bird call, a magic \nformula, and singing were expressed by the same word in Germanic \nlanguages. 7 \n\nThe magpie was especially revered as an oracle. It was a picus \n(pecker) sacred to the Goddess Mag, or Magog, eponymous ances- \ntress of Scythian Magnetes, the Amazonian centaurs credited with \nprophetic powers. 8 In Rome, the magpie or woodpecker was a \ntotemic form of the god Mars, said to contain his soul between his \nincarnations as Maris or Faunus. \n\nIn Egypt the hawk represented the soul of Horus and of the \npharaoh who embodied him. Hawks came to stand for that portion of \nevery soul called the ba, which could come and go at will after death, \nflying freely in and out of the tomb. Narrow shafts were left open in pit \ngraves for the passage of the ba. Similar shafts in pyramids, sometimes \nmisconstrued as ventilation shafts, were originally intended to let the \nbird-soul of the deceased fly in and out. 9 \n\nThe bird-soul born out of the cremated body entered Egyptian \nmythology as the Phoenix, sometimes a man, sometimes a firebird. \nThe name was Greek, meaning "the Phoenician," a reference to \nsacrificed sacred kings of Astarte at Byblos, where they were frequent- \nly burned. 10 The cult moved to North Africa with Phoenician colonists, \nand was carried on at Carthage where sacred kings perished in flames \nto a very late date. 11 Their bird-souls, reborn from the flames and flying \nto heaven, gave rise to the myth of the Egyptian Phoenix who \nperiodically cremated himself and rose again from his ashes. His \nworshippers, identified with the god through his sacraments, partook \nof the same power of heavenly flight. A common expression for death \nwas "flying away." \n\nPhilo wrote of the sages\' soul-flights: "They accompany in thought \nthe Moon and Sun in their circuitings, the choirs of other planets and \nfixed stars, attached below to the ground by their bodies, but giving \nwings to their souls, so that, walking on the ether, they contemplate the \npowers they find there." Still known today as the yogic trance or out-of- \nbody experience, the soul-flight was often described in medieval \nbooks on Hermetic magic: "Nothing can obstruct, neither the Sun\'s fire \nnor the Ether nor the heaven\'s revolution nor the bodies of other \nstars; but, cutting across all space, the soul will ascend in its flight up to \nthe furthest heavenly body." 12 Bird lore has always clearly expressed \nman\'s envy of the power of flight and his longing to know what the \nworld looks like from high in the sky. \n\n1.

The system is still followed in some parts of the world. \nAmong the Hunza, pregnant or nursing women do not sleep with their \nhusbands. The Semai of Malaya think it correct to forbid sex during \nthe long nursing period, as this allows parents to space their children and \ngive adequate care to each one. 1 Even in an aggressive male- \ndominated society like the Yanomamo, men say they are afraid to have \nsexual intercourse with a nursing mother. \n\nSometimes modern people insult the animals by calling a human \nrapist an "animal." Animals don\'t rape. Sexual intercourse takes place \nonly when the female is receptive. When she is preoccupied with caring \nfor her young always her first priority the female shows no sexual \ninterest in the male. Should he be so ill-advised as to make sexual \ndisplays to her, she drives him away with bared teeth. \n\nThere is among animals no question of the use of force on the part \nof the male; the conjunction of the sexes is dependent upon the \nwillingness of the female. . . . And the female sexual instincts are subject \nto frequent and prolonged natural suspensions which do not always \ncorrespond with the operation of those instincts in the male. Among all \nherbivores the females, as soon as they are pregnant, retire from the \ncompany of the males to seek either complete seclusion and solitude, or to \ncollect in herds from which the males are excluded. Female elephants \ndrive away all males from the herds of cows and calves not only during the \nlong pregnancy of nearly two years, but throughout the period of \nlactation. The behavior is typical of animal females. Had the primitive \nhuman female admitted the male during menstruation, pregnancy, and \nlactation she would have departed from all biological precedents; her \nbehavior would have constituted an abnormality. 2 \n\nMany early records show that human females did not depart \nfrom biological precedent. Hippocrates and Galen supported the an- \ncient taboo on sex during pregnancy and lactation. There was a \ncurious remnant of the taboo even in a popular marriage manual of the \nearly 20th century, part of the vast body of sexual misinformation that \nour grandparents struggled with. The author declared that marital \nrelations during pregnancy would make the child epileptic. 3 \n\nIn most primitive societies it was unthinkable that male sexual \ndesires should take precedence over the needs of mothers and their \nchildren. 4 Patriarchy everywhere sought to change this, through reli- \ngious sanction. Women were to serve men\'s sexual urges even when \npreoccupied with motherhood. This was the meaning of God\'s an- \nnouncement to Eve: "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy \nconception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire \nshall be subject to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee" \n\n103 \n\n\n\nBirth Control (Genesis 3:16). In this context, "sorrow" meant labor pangs, as well as \n\nthe harried life of a mother with children too close together, and the \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m illnesses and injuries caused by spreading a mother\'s care too thin. \n\nThe Christian canon omitted the First Book of Adam and Eve, \nwhich contradicted the canonical scripture by stating that Eve stuck \nto the old system of birth control after all. She gave birth to Cain \nand his twin sister Luluwa, another incarnation of the lilu or "lily" \nwho was also Eve\'s predecessor Lilith. Then "when the days of \nnursing the children were ended" but not until then "Eve again \nconceived." She produced Abel and his twin sister. After Abel was \nkilled at the age of 15 years, Eve produced Seth to replace him. \n"After the birth of these, Eve ceased from childbearing." 5 Thus the \nentire human race descended from these four: Cain, Seth, and their \nsisters. According to this version of the story, Eve was not particu- \nlarly troubled by God\'s curse. \n\nHowever, later Judeo-Christian culture insisted on men\'s con- \ntrol of women\'s bodies. Wives were not to initiate sexual relations, but \nthey were never to deny their husbands. The Catholic church laid \ndown the law that no wife could accuse her husband of rape even if he \nforced her with accompanying brutality. Sexual "release" was his \nconjugal right (but not hers). \n\nThe church interpreted the fable of Genesis as God\'s mandate to \ncompel women to bear as many children as possible, even at the cost \nof the children\'s or the mothers\' physical health and welfare. 6 Men \nrefused to deal with the problem of over-production, and women \nwere forbidden to do so, by the church\'s tradition. In pagan times, \nwomen used some fairly effective birth-control devices, ranging from \nvaginal sponges to abortifacient drugs. Many churchmen believed the \nwitches inherited secret knowledge of such things, which contributed \nto the vigor of witch- and midwife-persecutions. \n\nFather Dominic Pruemmer recently wrote in American Freedom \nand Catholic Power: "Birth control is nothing else than mutual \nmasturbation or unnatural lust." 7 It is not usual to view the "lust" \nof marital partners for each other as unnatural. Nor did the church ever \nobject to sex as masturbation when it was for a husband\'s benefit \nonly that is, not mutually satisfying. In fact church-sanctioned litera- \nture of the 1 7th century said the only purpose of marital sex must be \nconception, and if a woman receives too much pleasure she cannot \nconceive. 8 \n\nThe church further taught women that their children belonged \nmore to God than to themselves, thus eroding the instinctive mater- \nnal possessiveness that fosters the best of child care. Not illogically, \nmothers often left their unwanted children for God to care for. In the \n1 8th century, the hospital of St. Vincent de Paul in Paris reported \nas many as 5000 infants annually deposited on God\'s doorstep. 9 Infant \ncorpses were rather commonly found among the rubbish of western \ncities. Foundling hospitals were so busy that they set revolving boxes in \n\n\n\n104 \n\n\n\ntheir walls, so infants could be passed through. Yet foundling hospi- Birth Control \n\ntals seldom saved the children they were given. In practice, they solved \n\nthe problem of excess births by killing babies by the thousands, under ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe sanction of male-dominated officialdom. 10 \n\nLondon\'s first foundling hospital admitted 1 5,000 infants in the \nfour years between 1756 and 1760. Of these, fewer than a third \nsurvived to adolescence. On the continent, the death rate for children in \nfoundling institutions ran between 80 and 90 percent during the first \nyear of life. Parish officers entrusted the care of newborns to women \nnicknamed "killing nurses," because they were expected to do the \nstate\'s dirty work, and see to it that the unwanted children did not long \nsurvive. 11 \n\nIn effect, the patriarchal society having outlawed birth control and \nabortion could find nothing better to do with the overflow than \ndestroy it after all. Apparently this was all right, as long as the decision to \ngive life or withhold it was not being made by the mothers them- \nselves. Vetter found this kind of morality puzzling: \n\nIs there any evidence that religion has provided a superior brand of \nwisdom for the guidance of secular affairs, or in the burning social \nissues of the day? With the population of the earth growing by geometric \nleaps from unchecked fertility but with epidemics and diseases well \nunder control, what religious leaders spoke up for the necessity of planned \nparenthood? Not one! But many did hound Margaret Sanger to prison \nfor her constructive work in that direction. IZ \n\nAn Englishwoman gave the following picture of conventional \nmorality in regard to reproduction, indicating that religious leaders care \nfor their own mythology and ceremonial well ahead of the future \nwelfare of the race: \n\nIn a village that I know well a woman, legally married, bore five idiot \nchildren one after the other; her husband was a confirmed drinker and \na mental degenerate. One of the children fortunately died. The text that \nwas chosen for his funeral card was "Of such is the kingdom of \nheaven. "About the same time in the same village a girl gave birth to an il- \nlegitimate child. She was a beautiful girl; the father, who did not live in \nthe village, was strong and young; probably the child would have been \nhealthy. But the girl was sent from her situation and, later, was driven \nfrom her home by her father. At the last she sought refuge in a disused \nquarry, and was there for two days without food. When we found her, \nher child had been born and was dead. Afterwards the girl went mad. n \n\nMargaret Sanger gave her life to the effort to prevent such \ntragedies, both within and without marriage. She believed that "excess \n\npeople, not acts of God, created poverty, famine, and war All \n\nsociety would gain . . . if birth control were allowed to shut off the spigot \nthat floods the world with weaklings. When sick and unfit mothers \nwere not forced to breed, there would be an end to unwanted children \nwho grow up to fill our prisons and asylums." 14 \n\nBut churches still doggedly opposed the right of women to \n\n\n\n105 \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male determine when, where, and how much they shall breed, largely \n\nbecause of the deep-seated male desire to control the life-giving miracle \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ m in which men play only a negligible part biologically. It can hardly be \ndenied that male-dominated religions were everywhere devoted to this \nend from their earliest inception. As a result, overpopulation threatens \nthe world with virtually unthinkable ecological and sociological dis- \nasters. 15 Even now, in the face of such disasters, religious leaders tend \nto the view that the faithful should multiply forever. \n\nl.Dentan,98. 2.

Brahmanas are \nprose commentaries on \nVedic scriptures, dated \nfrom 800 to 500 B.C. \n\n\n\nPadma Purana \n\n"Lotus Purana." Pura- \nnas are ancient \nSanskrit scriptures in \nverse, treating of cos- \nmologies, sacred \nhistories, and the na- \nture of the divine. \n\n\n\nRig Veda Foremost \nof the four Aryan scrip- \ntures written in Vedic \n(an older form of San- \nskrit), ca. 1500-1200 \nB.C., containing sacred \nmythology, hymns, \nand verses; literary \nfoundations of the \nVedic religion. \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male \n\nSince birth-giving was the only true mark of divinity in primitive \nbelief, the first gods to claim any sort of supremacy had to claim also the \nability to give birth. In fact, usurpation of the feminine power of \nbirth-giving seems to have been the distinguishing mark of the earliest \ngods. \n\nLacking vaginas, many gods gave birth from their mouths. Priests \nof Ra claimed their god gave birth to the first couple from his mouth. \nThe Satapatha Brahmana said the god Prajapati learned to give birth to \ncreatures from his mouth; but before he could manage it, he had to \nmake sacrifices to an older, higher power: the Goddess Svaha, Lady of \nSacrifices. According to the Padma Purana, a god named Sukra \n(Seed) was born from Shiva\'s penis, after living in Shiva\'s belly for a \nhundred years. However, this was not a proper maternal-type birth. \nSukra existed beforehand, and Shiva had to make himself pregnant by \nswallowing him. 1 \n\nThe Rig Veda spoke of a male creator who gave birth to the \nMother of Creation, then impregnated her, so she brought forth the \nrest of the universe. Brahmans tried to claim the Mother of All Gods \nwas born from Brahma\'s body, even though she was the mother of \nBrahma too. 2 Brahma was known as Lotus-Born, meaning he sprang \nfrom the primal Yoni, the Goddess Padma ("Lotus"). His first \nLotus Throne was located in her lap. The Rig Veda also called her Vac, \nthe Great Womb, the Queen, the First, the Greatest of All Deities. \nShe said: "I begot the All-Father on high. I dwell in the waters, the \ndeep, and thence extend through all creatures, and touch the heavens \nwith my crown. Like unto the wind I blow, encompassing all creatures; \nabove the heavens and above the earth." 3 \n\nHellenic Greeks pretended their new Father Zeus gave birth to the \nmuch older Goddess Athene from his head. But before he could \ngive birth to Athene, he had to swallow her real mother, Metis \n(Wisdom), who was pregnant with her at the time. 4 The Hellenes \nalso claimed Zeus gave birth to Dionysus from his thigh; but again, the \n\n\n\n106 \n\n\n\nreal mother was the Moon-goddess Selene, whom Zeus killed during Birth-Giving, Male \n\nher pregnancy. As Conductor of Souls, Hermes took the six-month \n\nfetus from Selene\'s womb and sewed him up in Zeus\'s thigh to \n\ncontinue his gestation. ^^^^^^^^ 11 \n\nA Greek carving showed the god Apollo sitting on a pile of eggs, \ntrying to copy the life-giving magic of his mother Leto, or Leda, or \nLatona, who gave birth to the World Egg and hatched it. 5 This World \nEgg was an old Oriental idea. The Satapatha Brahmana said it \ncontained "the continents, the oceans, the mountains, the planets and \nthe divisions of the universe, the gods, the demons, and humanity." 6 \nThus, birth laying the egg was the image of cosmic creation, and \ncreator-gods needed to copy it. In Egypt, the mother of the World \nEgg was Hathor in the guise of the Nile Goose, later mythologized as \nthe Goose who laid the Golden Egg. (See Goose.) \n\nAtum, the local god of Heliopolis, the biblical "City of On," \nclaimed to give birth to a primal couple from his penis by masturbat- \ning. Pyramid Texts of 2000 B.C. said "Atum created in Heliopolis by an \nact of masturbation. He took his phallus in his fist, to excite desire \nthereby. And the twins were born, Shu and Tefnut." 7 However, priests \nof Khepera insisted that their god produced Shu and Tefnut by \nmasturbation and self-fertilization through his mouth. Yet the oldest \ntraditions said Shu and Tefnut ("Dryness" and "Moisture") were \nborn of the primal Mother, Iusaset. Like the biblical God who copied \nher many centuries later, she not only created the first couple, but \nalso brought forth light as her first act of creation. 8 \n\nBefore begetting was understood, archaic myth-makers tried all \nsorts of ideas for making a male body produce offspring. A Chinese \nancestor-god, Kun, suffered a crude Caesarian section. He was slain and \ncut open so Yu, founder of the Hsia dynasty, could emerge from his \nstomach. 9 Norsemen said a first male-and-female couple were born \nfrom the sweaty armpit of the giant Ymir, who imitated Mother \nEarth in that his flesh became the soil, his blood the sea, his bones the \nmountains. 10 Ymir\'s skull became the dome of the heavens, support- \ned at four corners by four dwarves, Austri, Vestri, Nordri, and Sudri \n(East, West, North, and South), northern copies of the Sons of \nHorus. \' \' Similar cardinal-direction gods became identified with the four \nangels of the Apocalypse and four evangelists, whose totems were \nthe same. 12 Totem Symbol or \n\nThe god Loki gave birth to Odin\'s horse, after making himself embodiment of an \n\npregnant by eating a woman\'s heart. 15 The usual mythic symbol of a rationahSrif 31 \' ^ \n\nwoman\'s heart, from Egypt to northern Europe, was an apple. Thus it frequently in animal \n\nmight be assumed that in some prototypical versions of the Eden f orm; a divine or \n\nstory, Adam ate the apple before, not after, he gave birth to Eve. semi-divine mascot \n\nAdam\'s birth-giving was a syncretic product of numerous local supposed to have \n\nnotions of the male mother. A Hittite god, Kumarbi, managed to esce " e r man \n\n_ r , animal ancestor, \n\nbecome pregnant by eating his rival s penis. His offspring retused to \n\ncome out through his mouth or ears, and having no vagina he was \n\n\n\n107 \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male unable to deliver them. Finally the sea god Ea took them out through \n\nhis side, as Adam\'s God did later. The idea for Adam\'s magic birth- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ giving rib came from a Sumerian childbirth-goddess, Nin-ti, "Lady of the \nRib." Since ti meant both "rib" and "life," she was also a Lady of \nLife. She made infants\' bones in utero from their mothers\' ribs, which is \nwhy biblical writers thought ribs possessed the magic of maternity. 14 \n\nAn odd male-birth myth came from Persia\'s intensely patriarchal \nZoroastrian cult, suggesting a combination of homosexuality and \nbestiality. The primal being, the Sole-Created Bull, was castrated and \nslain. Its semen went to the moon to be purified; then from this \npurified seed two new bulls were formed. From these, "all animals \ndescended." The hidden feminine element in this phallic fantasy was \nthe moon, of course; but the two bulls must have procreated homosex- \nually. This idea was not unknown even in Christian Europe. \n"Authorities" like Paracelsus taught that a monster may be born of a \nman as a result of oral or anal intercourse with another man. 15 No \nmatter how impossible it seemed, men apparently wished to preserve at \nany price the notion that a male could give birth. \n\nChristianity demoted the Goddess to mortal status in both Eve and \nMary, whom mystics regarded as two incarnations of the same \nperson. In both incarnations she was a Mother of her Father. Gnostic \nGospels said Adam came into being from the virgin Earth, who was \nnone other than Eve. 16 The story of her birth from Adam was a late, \ndistorted version of the myth. \n\nUnless the male spirit is able as in mathematics to construct a purely \nabstract world, it must make use of the nature symbols originating in \nthe unconscious. But this brings it into contradiction with the natural \ncharacter of the symbols, which it distorts and perverts. Unnatural \nsymbols and hostility to the nature symbol e.g. Eve taken out of \nAdam are characteristic of the patriarchal spirit. But even this attempt \nat revaluation usually fails, as an analysis of this symbolism might show, \nbecause the matriarchal character of the nature symbol asserts itself \nagain and again. \' 7 \n\nThroughout the world, men\'s initiatory dramas enacted birth- \ngiving to represent even the attainment of man\'s estate. Apparently men \ncould think of no better way to adopt new members into their \nfraternities than to make the novices symbolically dead and reborn, \noften from a male mother. In New Guinea, initiates into the men\'s \ngroup crawled out from between the legs of men costumed as the birth \nspirit. 18 Australian men opened their veins to bathe a young initiate \ninto their blood, magically imitating the blood of the womb. 19 \n\nBaptismal rebirth from male blood was an idea shared by all \nmystery cults of the early Christian era. In the Mithraic Mysteries, an \ninitiate was showered with the blood of the sacrificial bull and pro- \nnounced "reborn for eternity." 20 Afterward he was fed on milk, like \nan infant. 21 From primitive times to the present, men\'s groups devised \ntheatrical imitations of birth, often claiming the rites were stolen from \n\n\n\n108 \n\n\n\nwomen or that women were murdered for them and have sought to Bitch \n\nprotect these masquerades with all the taboos their priesthoods could \n\ninvent. 22 In Malekula, men even applied the name of mara to the place ^^^^__ ^_ \nwhere male initiations were held; it meant the women\'s obstetrical ^^^^^^ \n\nenclosure or birth-temple. 23 \n\nIn its determined exclusion of women, early Christianity evolved \nsome "birth rites" of a somewhat homosexual cast. Some writers \nclaimed Christian men could "impregnate" each other, in the spiritual \nsense, by kissing: "For it is by a kiss that the perfect conceive and give \nbirth." 24 But it was hard for men to see themselves as perfect, when \nthey conspicuously lacked the ability to bring forth and nurture new \nmembers of their race. Thus their endless quest for superiority nearly \nalways required some travesty of motherhood. \n\nSymbolic motherhood represented authority in the medieval \nRussian Orthodox wedding ceremony. The bridegroom threw the \nlap of his gown over his bride, signifying adoption by the ancient rite of \nmock birth. The wearer of the gown was "mother"; the one emerg- \ning from under it was "child." The Christian idea was to show that a \nhusband exercised over his wife the authority of a mother over her \nchild.

The Bitch-goddess of antiquity was \nknown in all Indo-European cultures, beginning with the Great Bitch \nSarama who led the Vedic dogs of death. The Old English word for \na hunting dog, bawd, also became a naughty word because it applied to \nthe divine Huntress\'s promiscuous priestesses as well as her dogs. 1 \n\nHarlots and "bitches" were identified in the ancient Roman cult of \nthe Goddess Lupa, the Wolf Bitch, whose priestesses the lupae gave \ntheir name to prostitutes in general. 2 Earthly representatives of the Wolf \nBitch ruled the Roman town of Ira Flavia in Spain, as a queen or \nseries of queens named Lupa. 3 \n\nIn Christian terms, "son of a bitch" was considered insulting not \nbecause it meant a dog, but because it meant a devil that is, a \nspiritual son of the pagan Goddess. \n\n1.

According to Tacitus, the Celts "deemed it \nindeed a duty to cover their altars with the blood of captives." 2 The \nRomans did the same in essence, though their altars were "blessed" with \nthe blood of sacrificial animals. \n\nCatholics now bless altars by sprinkling them with salt, an ancient \ncustom of the Jews, based on the primitive idea that blood and salt \nwere magical equivalents because they tasted alike. Egyptian altars were \ndedicated with salt. In Egypt, dedi was the magic salt that made Nile \nwater become "as human blood." 3 (See Menstrual Blood; Salt.) \n\nBlessing a person by drawing a cross on his head and breast \noriginated with the Mithraic rite of the Taurobolium, when the cross \n(an emblem of Mithra) was marked thus on participants with the bull\'s \nblood, so they became official witnesses of the ceremony of rebirth. \n\n\n\n110 \n\n\n\nTo be blessed meant to be saved, through the magic of blood, as the \nChristian Gospels also admitted: "Almost all things are by the law \npurged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission" \n(Hebrews 9:22). \n\nl.M.

Vishnu \nsaid the blood of his boar incarnation had the creative power that only \nthe Mother\'s blood formerly had: "Gods and creatures arise out of \nthe sacrifice, for the sacrifice is their appointed food. Everything will \nalways arise from the sacrifice; this whole universe is made of the \nsacrifice." Vishnu dared to copulate with the Earth Goddess while she \nwas menstruating, and begot three boar-sons who were also sacrificed \nby "gods saying Om," the Word of creation. 1 \n\nVishnu the Boar represented an early attempt to re-assign to a \nmale the holy creative blood of life, the Goddess\'s menstruum. As the \nphallic god who gave his life for humanity, he was worshipped in \nconjunction with the Goddess by Germanic Aryans who, Tacitus \nsaid, "worship the mother of the gods, and wear as a religious symbol \nthe device of a wild boar." 2 \n\nThis Germanic boar-god became the doomsday-averting Savior \nand Lord of Death, in both human and porcine form, "born in the \ndays of old . . . of the race of gods." He was identified with Heimdall, \nborn of the Earth-and-Sea mother, fathered by boar blood. "He was \nmade strong with the force of the earth, with the cold sea and the blood \nof the sacrificial boar." 3 That is, like most gods, in dying he begot \nhimself again. \n\nThe boar-god was sacrificed especially at Yul (Yule), with an apple \nin his mouth, symbolizing his regenerated heart-soul, according to \nthe Scandinavian belief that apples were resurrection charms. 4 Hence \nthe traditional Yule pig roasted with an apple in its mouth. There was \na mystical meaning behind the pork-eating ritual. "Valhalla\'s boar" was \ncooked in a cauldron, the regenerative womb-symbol, and the skalds \nsaid of it, "It\'s prime of pork, but few men know on what Valhalla\'s \nchampions feed." 5 If one may hazard a guess, Valhalla\'s champions \nused to feed on human flesh, for which the boar was substituted. \nSwedish priests in boar masks were regarded as incarnations of Frey, \nand husbands of Freya, indicating an identification with the sacrificial \ngod who once wedded the Mother and died as both a boar and a \nman. 6 \n\nThe Jews\' taboo on pig\'s flesh was nothing so hygienic or rational \nas fear of trichinosis, as some modern apologists have tried to suggest, \nshowing gross misunderstanding of the biblical mentality. Reinach said, \n"In the whole of the Bible there is not a single instance of an epi- \ndemic or a malady attributed to the eating of unclean meats. ... To the \nBiblical writers, as to contemporary savages, illness is supernatural; it \nis an effect of the wrath of spirits. The pious Jew abstains from pork \nbecause his remote ancestors, five or six thousand years before our \nera, had the wild boar as their totem." 7 \n\nLike their neighbors, the Jews worshipped sacrificial boar-gods: \n\n\n\n112 \n\n\n\nSyrian Adonis, for one. Boars were offered to Astarte in Syria, and to Bogey \n\nher counterpart Demeter in Greece. Demeter\'s Eleusinian Mysteries \n\nmythologized the boar sacrifice as "pigs falling into a crevice in the ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nearth" at the moment when Pluto, Lord of Death, seized his virgin \n\nbride Kore. 8 The custom of driving sacrificial pigs into pits, as in the \n\nrites of Demeter and Astarte, appeared in Christian Gospels as the \n\nmiracle-tale of the Gadarene swine, whose sacrificial death impelled \n\nby "demons" was re-assigned to the intervention of Jesus (Mark \n\n5:11-13). \n\nMyths of dying gods like Tammuz, Attis, and Adonis featured the \nboar, or boarskin-clad priest, who sacrificed the god in swine form. \nSuch gods were "gored in the groin" by the boar, an allegory of ritual \ncastration. 9 As lovers of the Goddess, they were chosen from mem- \nbers of her priesthood. The sacrificer of Adonis was another of the \nGoddess\'s lovers, Ares, wearer of the boarskin. The sacrificer and \ncastrater of Attis was his divine alter ego, a boar sent by Zeus, or by the \nking of Phrygia these presumed simultaneously incarnate in the \nsame body. 10 Like Christ, Attis was the dying Son later resurrected as \nthe Father who decreed his death in the first place. Similarly, Vishnu \nthe Boar decreed death for his boar-sons. 11 Some myths said Attis died \nin the same way as Adonis, being gored by a boar. Others said Attis \nhimself was the boar, a totemic sign of his kingship. 12 \n\nMalekula presents an original primitive view of the sacrificial \nanimal as savior or surrogate for men. Mother Death guards the gates \nof the after-world. A man must pass these gates by distracting her \nattention with his sacrificial pig. While she devours the pig, he slips \nby her. 13 After sacrificing and eating on earth the savior-pig who \nbecomes part of himself, the man says, "It is no longer I who live, but \nmy sacrifice who lives in me." H Christians similarly ate their god in \ncommunion, and were taught to recite at the gate of heaven, "No \n\nmore I, but Christ." \nThe old cults of the boar were not altogether forgotten. Medieval \nfairy tales abound in magic boars, often figuring as sacrificial animals. \nThe first French book printed on the subject of witchcraft, de Spina\'s \nFortress of the Faith, declared that French witches assembled at a \ncertain sacred rock to worship the devil in the shape of a boar. 15 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty, 196-97. 2.

Like other Manicheans, they held that \nthe God who created this world of matter was a demon. 1 \n\nThe Bogomils were highly puritanical but less sexist than the \nRoman church. They admitted women to religious offices on an \nequal basis with men. The Catholic writer Cosmas condemned as \n"deviltry" their custom of appointing women to hear confessions and \ngive absolution to men. 2 Up to the late 14th century, Bogomilism was \n"the most powerful sectarian movement in the history of the Bal- \nkans," but Catholic crusades drove many members of the sect into the \narms of Islam, and the movement was crushed.

Spinka, p. 66. \n\n\n\nBones \n\nMany religions tabooed breaking the bones of a sacrificial animal, on \nthe theory that the gods needed a complete skeleton to resurrect it \nanew. 1 On one occasion, the god Thor killed and resurrected two \ngoats, but the thighbone of one had been damaged, so the new goat was \nlame. 2 \n\nThe same belief is evident in the Bible. Concerning the paschal \nlamb, God ordered: "Neither shall ye break a bone thereof" (Exodus \n12:46); "They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break \nany bone of it" (Numbers 9:12); "He keepeth all his bones; not one of \nthem is broken" (Psalms 34:20). To fulfill all these alleged prophe- \ncies, Jesus\'s bones were left intact to identify him with the Lamb: "That \n\n\n\n114 \n\n\n\nthe scripture should be fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken" \n(John 19:36). \n\nSeveral saints\' legends also made use of regenerative bones. \nSt. Germain resurrected a calf, on whose flesh he had just feasted, by \nlaying the bones on the hide and praying over them. 3 A derivative\' \nmedieval belief was that every body contains an incorruptible seed-bone, \n"out of which, as they say, as a plant out of the seed, our animal \nbodies shall in the resurrection of the dead spring up." 4 \n\nl.Lnrvusse, 307. 2. Silberer, 82. 3. de Voragine, 398. 4. Agrippa, 88. \n\n\n\nBrahma \n\n\n\nBrahma \n\nIndia\'s patriarchal god, whose priests tried to establish wholly male- \ndominated society and eliminate the Mother Goddess who, \nnevertheless, remained the parent of Brahma as she was of the other \ngods. Though some of Brahma\'s scriptures tried to dissociate him from \nthe Mother by calling him "the Birthless," yet the same scriptures \nincongruously referred to him as the Goddess\'s "Firstborn." 1 \n\nThe older dharma (holy law) said the worst of crimes was killing a \nwoman or female child, because it meant killing unborn generations. 2 \nHowever, like most patriarchal systems, Brahmanism lifted the taboo on \nmale aggression against females, and claimed that it was better to kill \nwomen than to insult Brahmans: "To revile and calumniate a worship- \nper of the Supreme Brahman is a sin ten million times worse than \nthat of killing a woman." 3 \n\nLike the medieval Christian church, Brahman priests made rules \nfor rigid control of wives, and made their deity say any other kind of \nmarriage was a sin that made the wife a whore and the children \nillegitimate, disqualified for religious observances. 4 \n\nBrahman marriage reversed the old system of matrilineal inheri- \ntance, insisting that property must pass from father to son. A widow \nwithout male children was entitled to inherit only if she "lives under the \ncontrol of the relations of her husband, and in their absence under \nthe control of her father\'s relations" that is, male relations "then \nonly is she entitled to inherit. The woman who is even likely to go \nastray is not entitled to inherit the husband\'s property." 5 In practice of \ncourse, any or all of these male groups could easily declare the widow \nunfit to inherit and divide the property among themselves. \n\nBrahmanism was essentially paternal ancestor-worship, possibly the \nroot of similar paternal ancestor-worship instituted in Israel by the \nlegendary Abraham, whose name meant "Father Brahm." There was \nthe same obsession with record-keeping. At every Brahman wedding, \nlong lists of paternal ancestors were recited, like the biblical lists of \n"begats." Brahman sons were taught to recite: "My father is my \nhighest Dharma My father is my Heaven. On my father being \n\n\n\n115 \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\n\n\nsatisfied, the whole Universe is satisfied." Brahma also displayed the \npatriarchal god\'s usual insistence on exclusivity: "Those who are averse \nto My doctrine are unbelievers and sinners, as great as those who slay \na Brahman." 6 \n\nIt is clear that Jewish patriarchy owed a debt to Brahman prece- \ndent. From the Far East came the legend of the Golden Age of \nrighteousness, when men were free from sin, had great longevity, and \ngrew to gigantic size. 7 Comparable were the long-lived biblical \npatriarchs of the antediluvian age when there were "giants in the earth" \n(Genesis 6:4). The story of Cain and Abel was Indo-Iranian. Vedic \npoets used to beg their god to accept their sacrifices, and reject those of \nother arya (men). 8 \n\nThe legend of Jonah was prefigured by the Indian tale of Candra- \ngomin, who endangered the ship he sailed on because a rival \nmagician caused a storm and took the form of a sea beast to swallow \nhim. 9 \n\nTalmudic tradition adopted the typical Oriental belief in transmi- \ngration of souls; Adam\'s soul passed by transmigration into David, \nthan into the Messiah. 10 Brahmanic revelation seemed to be part of the \nMessianic promise also. The Katha Upanishad said Brahma is realized \nin one\'s own soul dimly, as if seen in a mirror; but in the heaven of \nBrahma he is realized clearly, "as one distinguishes light from \ndarkness." 11 The New Testament repeats the same message copied al- \nmost word for word: "For now we see through a glass (i.e., mirror) \ndarkly, but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). The Brahman \ndoctrine that a thousand years is one Day of Brahma is repeated in \nPsalms 90:4, and again in the First Book of Adam and Eve, where God \nexplains that "five days and a half for him means 5,500 years for \nmen. 12 \n\nBrahma is no longer popular in his native land. He is described as a \n"theologian\'s god, whose worship never struck vital roots in the \npopular folk soil." He was used mainly to support the caste system. \n"Today Brahma is so relatively unimportant that only one or two \ntemples in all India are reserved for his exclusive worship." 13 \n\n1.

However, some \nscholars believe the \nGlossary was compiled \nlater than his \nlifetime. \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\nTriple Goddess of the great Celtic empire of Brigantia, which \nincluded parts of Spain, France, and the British Isles. Before she was a \nsaint, she was a typical feminine trinity. Brigit ruled; her two sisters \ngoverned the arts of healing and smithcraft. Cormac\'s Glossary called \n\nher "Brigit the female sage Brigit the goddess, whom poets \n\nadored, because her protecting care over them was very great and very \nfamous." 1 \n\n\n\n116 \n\n\n\nDr. MacCulloch said Brigit "originated in a period when the Celts \nworshipped goddesses rather than gods, and when knowledge \nleechcraft, agriculture, inspiration were [sic] women\'s rather than \nmen\'s. She had a female priesthood and men were perhaps excluded \nfrom her cult, as the tabooed shrine at Kildare suggests." 2 Brigit\'s \npriestesses at Kildare kept an ever-burning sacred fire like that of the \ntemple of Vesta in Rome. They called the three personae of Brigit the \n"Three Blessed Ladies of Britain" or the "Three Mothers," and \nalways identified them with the moon. 3 \n\nThe number of Brigit\'s priestesses at Kildare was 19, representing \nthe 19-year cycle of the Celtic "Great Year." Greeks said the sun god \nof the north, whom they called Hyperborean Apollo, visited the north- \nern "temple of the moon goddess" once every 19 years, a mythic \nexpression of the coincidence of solar and lunar calendars. 4 In reality the \nperiod of coincidence was 18.61 years, which meant the smallest \nregular unit to give a"mating" of sun and moon was 56 years, two \ncycles of 19 and one of 18. This astronomical data was well known to \nthe builders of Stonehenge, who marked the span of Great Years with \nposts around their circle. 5 \n\nBrigit was older than Celtic Ireland, having come with Gaelic \nCelts from their original home in Galatia. One of her earliest shrines \nwas Brigeto in Illyricum. 6 Long before the Christian era, the Goddess \nof the Brigantes was said to be the same as Juno Regina, Queen of \nHeaven, and Tanit, the Dea Celestis (Heavenly Goddess). 7 \n\nFinding the cult of Brigit impossible to eradicate, the Catholic \nchurch rather unwisely canonized her as a saint, calling her Bridget \nor Bride. Hagiographers declared she was a nun who founded a convent \nat Kildare. But the convent was noted for its heathenish miracles and \nevidences of fertility magic. Cows never went dry; flowers and sham- \nrocks sprang up in Brigit\'s footprints; eternal spring reigned in her \nbower. Irish writers refused to reduce their Goddess to mere sainthood, \nand insisted that she was Queen of Heaven, which meant identifying \nher with Mary. She was called "Mother of my Sovereign, Mary of the \nGoidels, Queen of the South, Prophetess of Christ, Mother of \nJesus." 8 \n\nAn Irish charm against the evil eye suggested collusion between \nthe pagan and Christian heavenly-mother figures; it was "the Spell \nthe great white Mary sent to Bride the lovely fair." 9 She was also the \nmystic mother-bride of St. Patrick, supposed to have died as one of \nher sacrificial victims, and entered the underworld via her sacred grove \nat Deny Down. An old distich said, "On the hill of Down, buried in \none tomb, were Bridget and Patricius." 10 Since Patrick\'s name meant \n"father," and he was as apocryphal as other Irish saints, he may have \nbeen a new name for Brigit\'s old consort the Dagda or "father." \n\nThree churches of "St. Brigit" occupied her Triple-Goddess \nterritory of Hy Many, formerly Emania or Emain Macha, country of \nthe Moon. Baptismal fees of those churches belonged to the O\'Kelly \ntribes, descended from the Goddess\'s kelles or sacred harlots. Her \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\n\n\nJ. A.

St. Brigit\'s feast day was the first of \n\nFebruary, the first day of spring according to the pagan calendar. It \nwas called Oimelc, Imolg, or Imbulc, the day of union between God \nand Goddess. 11 \n\nThe same day was celebrated in Rome as the Lupercalia, sacred to \nVenus and to women generally. With unconscious irony, the church \ntransformed it into the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, also called \nCandlemas, which kept much of its pagan symbolism and was \nregarded as a major festival of witches. 12 \n\nLike other versions of the Celtic Goddess, Brigit was a teacher of \nthe martial arts, and a patron of warfare or briga. Her soldiers were \nbrigands, or as Christians called them, outlaws. 15 Robin Hood\'s merry \nmen were outlaws of the same kind; so were Kali\'s Thugs and the \n"Assassins" who worshipped the Arabian Moon-goddess. \n\nBrigit was canonized more than once. Besides the Irish Brigit there \nwas a St. Bridget of Sweden, foundress and supreme ruler of a double \nmonastery of both sexes, the Order of Brigantines. (See Convent.) A \nbranch of the ancient "colleges" of Brigit was a Brigantine House of \nSion established in 1420 on the bank of the Thames, where it flourished \nuntil 1589 as a center of education for ladies of noble birth. 14 \n\nI.

Burning sulfur was used \neven in medieval times to fumigate sickrooms and avert the plague. The \nuse of brimstone as an agent of purification accounts for its appear- \nance in the cauldron of Purgatory with its "fire and brimstone" to burn \naway sins. \n\nAlchemists tried to "marry Hermes and Athene" by combining \nmercury with brimstone, which they thought might create gold. \nThey never succeeded. \n\n1.

The \ntitles by which she was addressed in prayers and hymns were later mis- \nunderstood as the names of different deities, which is why the \nGoddess became "goddesses" in the west, or the Thousand-Named \nOne in the east. \n\n1 .

Graves, W.G., 39. \n\n\n\nBroomstick \n\nBroomsticks were long associated with witches because they figured \nin pagan rituals of marriage and birth, the Mysteries of Women. In \nRome the broom was a symbol of Hecate\'s priestess-midwife, who \n\n119 \n\n\n\nBroomstick swept the threshold of a house after each birth to remove evil spirits that \n\nmight harm the child. 1 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ As Hecate was also the Triple Goddess presiding over marriage, \n\nher broomstick signified sexual union. Old wedding customs included \njumping over a broomstick, possibly to represent impregnation. Gypsy \nweddings always included the same ritual, though gypsies now say they \ndon\'t know what it means. 2 Oddly enough, the same broom-jumping \nritual marked the churchless weddings of black slaves in nineteenth- \ncentury America. \n\nMedieval peasant weddings in Europe were also churchless, as a \nrule, coming under the jurisdiction of common law rather than canon \nlaw, and using the rites of the old religions rather than the new. The \nbroom was so closely identified with non-ecclesiastical marriages that \nby Renaissance times, when the church began to take over the nuptial \nrites, unions "by the broom" were declared illegitimate. English \nrustics still say "if a girl strides over a broom-handle, she will be a mother \nbefore she is a wife." A girl who gives birth to a bastard child is said to \nhave "jumped over the besom." ? \n\nAs a horse for witches to ride, the broomstick apparently signified \nTantric-type sexual unions which were primary attractions of the \nfemale-oriented witch cults. Plants genet, the broom plant, was sacred \nto witches. This may explain why the ruling family of Anjou in the \n12th century was named Plantagenet. Henry II, first Plantagenet king of \nEngland, inherited his throne by matrilineal succession through his \nmother Matilda, or Maud names commonly associated with witch- \ncraft the countess of Anjou. Genet also meant a horse or steed, the \n"royal horse" of paganism. This meaning is preserved in the word \njennet, a small horse or the female donkey, and in the names fre- \nquently taken by witches: Jenet, Janet, Jeannette, Jean, or Joan. \n\nSuch names suggested a witch-child born of a sacred marriage with \na phallic god represented by the broom. A Janet or Jenny was a \nDaughter of the Horse, and old gods like Volos, Volsi, Waelsi, or Odin \nwere called "Horse\'s Penis." 4 Riding the broomstick seems to have \ndenoted the kind of sexual position viewed as a perversion by the \nchurch, woman above, man below acting as her "horse." This sexual \nimplication is confirmed by the old witch-rhyme, "Ride a cock-horse to \nBanbury Cross (i.e., crossroads), to see a fine lady on a white horse." \nThe fine lady was Godiva, "the Goddess." Her white cock-horse \nsignifed her consort. 5 \n\nChildren rode the cock-horse as a broomstick with a horse\'s head, \ncopied from Sufi mystics who entered Spain in the early Middle \nAges. Besides their organization in groups of thirteen, like covens, and \ntheir worship of the Rabba or "Lord," later transformed into the \nwitches\' god Robin, Sufi sages rode horse-headed canes called zamal- \nzain, "gala limping horse." The dervish\'s stick-horse stood for the \nPegasus-like fairy steed that carried him to heaven and back. 6 Such \ncustoms became prevalent among the Basques, who were frequently \naccused en masse of witchcraft. \n\n120 \n\n\n\nAt times a witch\'s broomstick seems to have been nothing more \nthan a dildo, anointed with the famous "flying ointment" and used \nlor genital stimulation. 7 French witches "flew" this way: "With an \nlintment which the Devil had delivered to them they anointed a \nIvooden rod which was but small, and their palms and their whole hands \nlikewise; and so, putting this small rod between their legs, straightway \nIhey flew there where they wished to be . . . and the Devil guided \nIhem." 8 Certainly churchmen were prone to describe any kind \nIf masturbation as guided by the devil women\'s masturbation most \nlarticularly so, for nothing was more abhorrent to the patriarchal \nInind than the thought that women could experience sexual pleasure \nwathout men. \n\nWitches\' ointments often incorporated such drugs as aconite, \nleadily absorbable in an oil-based liniment through skin or mucus \nInembrane, producing symptoms like giddiness, confusion, lethargy, \nlingling sensations followed by numbness, and quite possibly the \nIllusion of flying. Thus Oldham wrote: \n\nSo witches some enchanted wand bestride, \nAnd think they through the airy regions ride. 9 \n\nBecause of their ancient association with pagan midwives and \njheir Christian counterparts the witches, broomsticks took on an accre- \nion of similar superstitions. Witches\' familiar spirits were said to be \ninable to cross running water; hence, it became "bad luck" to move a \nroom across running water. It was also "bad luck" to burn a broom, \nince it was certainly bad luck for the witch. 10 \n\n1. Dumezil, 616. 2. Trigg, 86-87. 3. Spence, 148. 4. Turville-Petre, 201. \n5. Hazlitt, 25. 6.

English "brother" stemmed from Sanskrit \nhratr, "support." In pre-Vedic India it was the duty of a brother, not a \nusband, to help support a woman and her children. Husbands came \nnd went, but the matrilineal clan remained stable. As an old proverb of \nirab women said: "A husband can be found, a son can be born, but a \nrother cannot be replaced." \' \n\nA preference for brothers over husbands may be found in many \nre-patriarchal cultures. Pagan Slavic women considered "by my \nrother" their most binding oath. In pre-Christian Norway, rune stones \nn women\'s graves were raised by their brothers, not their husbands. 2 \nindent systems of clan loyalty were similar to that of the Nairs, of \nhorn it was said that no man knew his father, but "every man looks \nn his sister\'s children as his heirs. A man\'s mother manages his \n\n\n\nBrother \n\n\n\n121 \n\n\n\nBuana \n\n\n\nfamily; and after her death his eldest sister assumes the direction." \nNames and property were bequeathed in the female line. 3 \n\nThe uterine-sibling bond was so much stronger than the marriage \nbond in ancient societies that the ultimate endearment of lovers or \nspouses was to call each other "brother" and "sister." 4 King Solomon \ncalled his bride "my sister, my spouse" (Song of Solomon 4:10) with \n"sister" in the place of honor. An Egyptian wife affectionately addresse \nher husband as "brother, husband, friend," in that order. 5 \n\nWeddings sometimes meant making bride and groom pseudo- \nsiblings in some magical way. Polynesian couples were not \nconsidered truly married until their two mothers mingled their blood, \nsignifying that the married pair were born of a double, or merged, \nwomb. 6 Often, the bride and groom mingled their own blood; this was \nthe common rite of gypsy weddings. 7 \n\nBrother-sister incest was customary in ancient ruling families, \nwhen it was felt that a king and queen should be offspring of the same \nmother, so the true line of succession would not be weakened. Egyptiai \npharaohs married their sisters as a matter of course because their \nthrones were inherited through the female line. 8 One pharaoh with onl \none son and one daughter suggested to his wife that the children \nmight marry outside the family. The queen angrily rejected the idea: \n"Dost thou wrangle with me? Even if I have no children after those \ntwo children, is it not the law to marry them one to the other?" 9 \n\nBrother-sister incest was everywhere the practice of the elder gods \nand goddesses, many of whom were twins who copulated even in \ntheir mother\'s womb. Examples are Isis and Osiris, Artemis and Apollo \nFauna and Faunus, Diana and Dianus, Zeus and Hera, Yama and \nYami, Freya and Frey. According to Norse skalds, brother-sister incest \nwas the accepted custom of the Vanir or elder deities. 10 \n\nMythological evidence tends to destroy the modern conception oi \nStone Age man protecting "his" cave with "his" mate and "their" \nchildren. If the home was a cave or anything else, it was probably \nselected, furnished, and owned by the female. If there was a male \nprotecting it, he was more likely to have been a sibling than a mate. In \nfact there were no monogamous families but only family groups, \ncentering on the women and children with impregnating males a loose \nchangeable periphery. \n\n1. Briffault 1, 405, 498, 505. 2.

The Amogha school of Buddhism practiced a severe \nmorality, a life of poverty and chastity in retirement from secular \nconcerns, and the expectation of a Savior coming to earth in the near \nfuture. 1 Buddhist sages provided prototypes of Christian miracles. \nThey were said to walk on water, to speak in tongues, and to ascend to \nheaven in the flesh. 2 Jains regarded the true Buddhist "hero" (vira) as \n"not he who is of great physical strength and prowess, the great eater \nand drinker, or man of powerful sexual energy, but he who has \ncontrolled his senses, is a truth-seeker, ever engaged in worship, and \nwho has sacrificed lust and all other passions." 3 \n\nBuddha is more properly the Buddha, since Buddha was not a \nname but a title, the "Enlightened or Blessed One," comparable to \nChristos, "the Anointed One." Buddha had many other names because \nhe had already lived through many incarnations on earth. Even the \nBuddha supposed to have appeared in the 5 th century B.C. had several \nnames: Gautama, Sakyamuni, Siddhartha the last, again, not a \nname but a title, "Rich in Yogic Power." Buddha was miraculously \nbegotten by the Lord of Hosts and born of the Virgin Maya, the \nsame Great Goddess worshipped throughout Asia and having the \nalternative Near-Eastern names of Maia, Marah, Mari, or Maria. 4 \n\nMany Buddhas who had already come and gone were bodhisattvas \nor saints, sometimes simply known as Buddhas. Any sage might \nbecome a bodhisattva through devotion to the holy life. But one true \nBuddha remained to come again to earth. He was Maitreya, the \nMaster, or the Future Buddha, similar to the being known as Kalki, the \nlast avatar of the god Vishnu who would appear with the approach of \ndoomsday. The final coming of the Savior would signal the end of the \npresent world. He would judge the righteous, and annihilate the \nwicked, and make everything ready for the ultimate creation of a new \nheaven and a new earth. 5 \n\nThese were basic ideas of Christianity as well as Buddhism: simple, \neasy to understand, dramatic, and appropriately aligned with arche- \ntypal hopes and fears. The more subtle teachings of Buddhism, like \nthose of Christianity, apparently developed out of group thinking of \nsubsequent sectaries, especially the more ascetic sort. Yet again, as in \nChristianity the ascetics were unable to blot out the rich, colorful \nsensuality of "pagan" Hinduism. Although they claimed Buddha said \nthe true sage must never see or speak to a woman, must avoid \nfeminine creatures like the plague, yet within a few centuries the \nworship of the Goddess reasserted itself and all the bodhisattvas were \nprovided with Shaktis who would welcome them to eternal sexual bliss \n\n123 \n\n\n\nBuddhism in heaven. "Tantric" Buddhism re-assimilated the feminine principle. \n\nUntil the advent of Islam, the original Buddhist asceticism was largely \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ forgotten except for a few eremitic groups. A well-known aphorism \nsaid: Buddhatvam yosidyonisamsritam, "Buddhahood resides in the \nvulva (yoni)." 6 \n\nBuddhist legends reveal the constant tension between ascetic and \nsensual elements. It was said Buddha wanted his brother Nanda to \nbecome a monk, but Nanda was too much in love with his beautiful \nmistress. So Buddha played a trick on him. He took Nanda to heaven \nand showed him the celestial nymphs, who were so desirable that Nanda \ninstantly forgot the mortal woman he had loved. Buddha then told \nhim these nymphs could be won only by a life of rigorous self-denial \nand meditation. Nanda agreed to join the monkish order. The ascetic \nlife soon purged him of all desires, and he became as celibate as Buddha \nhad wished but only because of his overwhelming lust for a tran- \nscendent sexual experience! 7 \n\nLike their western counterparts in later centuries, Buddhist monks \nself-consciously threatened the Goddess with destruction, even \nthough her virgin form had given birth to their Savior. A Buddhist \nhymn said, "This time I shall devour thee utterly, Mother Kali; for I \nwas born under an evil star and one so born becomes, they say, the \neater of his mother." 8 \n\nStories of the Buddha and his many incarnations circulated inces- \nsantly throughout the ancient world, especially since Buddhist monks \ntraveled to Egypt, Greece, and Asia Minor four centuries before Christ, \nto spread their doctrines. 9 Ascetics like the Essenes were certainly \ninfluenced by them. Christians continued to hear tales of Buddhist \norigin, and to relate them rather naively to their own beliefs. Buddha \nhimself entered the Christian canon as a saint St. Josaphat, a corrup- \ntion of Bodhisat when John of Damascus wrote down his life story \nin the 8th century a.d. 10 Buddha the Christian saint was supplied with \na companion called Barlaam, who converted the Indian prince to a \nChristian asceticism despite his royal father\'s efforts to thwart this \npurpose. 11 \n\nMany scholars have pointed out that the basic tenets of Christian- \nity were basic tenets of Buddhism first; but it is also true that the \nceremonies and trappings of both religions were more similar than \neither has wanted to acknowledge. \n\nBuddhism has much in common with Roman Catholic Christianity, \nhaving its purgatory, its Goddess of Mercy, and its elaborate machinery \nfor delivering the dead from pain and misery through the good offices of \nthe priests. Among other similarities may be mentioned celibacy, \nfasting, use of candles and flowers on the altar, incense, holy water, \nrosaries, priestly garments, worship of relics, canonization of saints, use \nof a dead language for the liturgy and ceremonials generally. The trinity of \nBuddhas, past, present, and future, is compared by some to the Father, \nSon, and Holy Ghost. The immaculate mother of Shakyamuni, whose \nname Maya is strikingly similar to that of Mary, the mother of Jesus, is \n\n124 \n\n\n\nBugger \n\n\n\nalso to be noticed, while Buddha\'s temptation on Vulture Peak by Mara \n\nthe Evil One, may also be contrasted with the similar temptation of \n\nOur Lord. . . . The worship of ancestors is in some measure akin to the \n\nsaying of masses for the dead, and at one time the Jesuits considered it a ^^^^^^"" \n\nharmless observance and tolerated it in their converts.

Bulgarian Paulicians were \nanathematized for disobeying the Roman pope, setting up their own \nchurches independent of Rome, and admitting women to clerical \noffice on an equal basis with men. 1 \n\nBosnian Patarenes were also called buggers, since they modeled \ntheir national church on that of Bulgaria. About 1200 a.d. the papacy \nlaunched "a cruel war against the Bosnian Patarenes, which lasted two \nand a half centuries, and finally culminated in the acceptance, on \ntheir part, of the Mohammedan faith and in becoming Turks, rather \nthan submit to the Roman See." 2 \n\nReligious wars led the Balkans into social chaos. Heretics were \nhunted down like animals, and tortured. Lands belonging to the \nheretic magnates (nobles) were seized and handed over to their Catholic \nenemies. The heretics for their part continued to regard themselves \nas the only true Christian nations. Under the anti-Roman Code of \nStephen, Catholic priests who tried to convert Balkan Christians back \nto "the Latin faith" were declared criminals. 3 Quarrels and conflicts \npersisted up to the present century. \n\n1. Knight, D.W.P., 176. 2. Spinka, 147. 3. Spinka, 167-68. \n\n\n\nBull \n\nThe biblical title translated "God" is El, originally the title of the \nPhoenician bull-god called Father of Men. As the "supreme god of the \nSemitic pantheon, El was worshipped throughout Syria alongside the \nlocal gods, or Ba\'als, one of his titles, indeed, being \'the Bull.\' " \' Like \nZeus the Bull, consort of Hera-Europa-Io the white Moon-Cow, El \nmarried Asherah, the Semitic sacred Cow. He was identified with Elias \nor Helios, the sun. He was still the Semitic Father of Men in the time \nof Jesus, who cried to him from the cross, calling him Father (Mark \n15:34). \n\nNearly every god of the ancient world was incarnate sooner or later \nin a bull. The Cretan moon-king called Minos inhabited a succession of \nMinotaurs (moon-bulls), who were sacrificed as the king\'s surrogates. \n\n\n\n125 \n\n\n\nBull Yama, the Hindu Lord of Death, wore a bull\'s head and became the \n\nunderworld judge, like Minos. 2 Shiva was incarnate in the white bull \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Nandi. 3 The real reason King Nebuchadnezzar "ate grass" probably \nwas that his soul temporarily entered into the body of the divine \nsacrificial bull (Daniel 4:33). Court prophets of the kings of Israel put \non bull masks to represent the king while casting spells for his victory \nover his enemies (1 Kings 22:1 1). 4 \n\nBull worship was a large part of Mithraism. The bull\'s blood was \ncredited with power to produce all creatures on earth without the aid of \nthe cow, though her power was implicit in that the bull\'s blood was \ntaken up and magically treated by the Moon. The bull was consecrated \nto Anahita, a Persian name of the Moon-goddess whom the Greeks \ncalled Artemis Tauropolos, "Bull-Slayer," of whom the bull-slaying \nsavior Mithra was a late, masculinized form. 5 Like most patriarchal \nsymbols, those of the Mithraic cult were copied from myths of the \nAsian Goddess. A statue of Kali in the Ellora caves shows her in the \npose typical of Mithra, holding up the nose of the sacrificial bull and \npreparing to slaughter it. 6 \n\nThe bull was killed for a baptism of blood at the Roman Taurobo- \nlium in honor of Attis, Cybele, or Mithra. "A trench was dug over \nwhich was erected a platform of planks with perforations and gaps. \nUpon the platform the sacrificial bull was slaughtered, whose blood \ndripped through upon the initiate in the trench ... he turned round and \nheld up his neck that the blood might trickle upon his lips, ears, eyes, \nand nostrils; he moistened his tongue with the blood, which he \nthan drank as a sacramental act. Greeted by the spectators, he came \nforth from this bloody baptism believing that he was purified from his \nsins and \'born again for eternity.\' " 7 The participant in the Taurobo- \nlium acted out literally what Christians called washing in the blood of \nthe lamb. \n\nEgypt\'s savior Osiris was worshipped in bull form as Apis-Osiris, \nthe Moon-bull of Egypt, annually slain in atonement for the sins of the \nrealm. 8 In the ceremony of his rebirth, he appeared as the Golden Calf, \nHorus, born of Isis whose image was a golden cow. The same Golden \nCalf was adored by the Israelites under Aaron (Exodus 32:4). \n\nThe Orphic god Dionysus also took the form of a bull; one of his \nearlier incarnations was the Cretan bull-god Zagreus, "the Goodly \nBull," a son and reincarnation of Zeus, and another version of the \nMinotaur. The god was a bull on earth, and a serpent in his subterra- \nnean, regenerating phase. The Orphic formula ran: "The bull is the \nfather of the serpent, and the serpent is the father of the bull." 9 \nDionysus was reincarnated over and over, and there were some who \nidentified him with the Persian Messiah. In the Book of Enoch, \nthe Messiah is represented as a white bull. 10 \n\nAthenian legends of the Moerae or Fates compared all men to \nthe sacrificial bull sentenced to death at the hands of Fate sooner or \nlater. Medieval superstition called the Fate-goddess Mora, a nocturnal \nspirit who roams the world seizing men and crushing them until they \n\n126 \n\n\n\n"roar like bulls." She was also Christianized as St. Maura, on whose Buto \n\nsacred day women were forbidden to sew, lest they "cut the thread of Byelobog \n\nlife" after the manner of the Moerae. 11 ^^^^-^_^^_^ \n\nIn medieval England, Twelfth Night games featured remnants of \nbull worship. A large cake with a hole in the center was thrown over the \nbull\'s horn, to form a lingam-yoni. The bull was then tickled, "to make \nhim toss his head." If he threw the cake behind him, it belonged to the \nmistress; if in front, it belonged to the bailiff. 12 This ceremony probably \nderived from an ancient custom of divination. Like all sacrificial victims \nalready dedicated to the supernatural realm, the bull was believed to \nhave prophetic powers. \n\n1. Larousse, 74. 2. Campbell, ML, 409. 3. Campbell, Or.M, 90. \n4.

Italian \nnobleman, philosopher \nand scholar, declared \na heretic for his \nattempts to unite \nChristian theology with \nCabalistic doctrine. \n\n\n\nCabala \n\nMedieval Jewish mystical system obviously influenced by Tantrism \nand Sufism, like the Christian courtly-love movement of the same \nperiod. The Cabala\'s basic premise was that all the world\'s ills \nstemmed from God\'s loss of contact with his female counterpart, the \nShekina, a Hebraic version of Shakti. God is fragmented, and only \nthe Shekina has power to "put God back together." \' Universal harmo- \nny must be restored by making God and his Goddess once more \n"one." 2 \n\nSexual union of mortals was thought to create its like on the plane \nof the divine. Therefore sexual intercourse was a sacramental act \nhelpful to God and the Shekina. "The efflorescence of such beliefs into \norgiastic rites suggests itself too readily not to be attempted, and in- \ndeed, in the further development of Kabbalistic doctrine, such attempts \nwere made." 5 Generally, however, the cabalist confined his erotic \nexperiments to his legal wife. The first step in his ascent of the \nSephiroth or Tree of Knowledge was the female sexual power, \nShekina-Malkuth, Queen and Bride, represented by the moon and the \nspouse. 4 Further steps made use of elaborate systems of numerology, \nmagic, and scriptural allegory, yielding successive revelations of the \ndivine nature. \n\nThe major cabalistic work was the Sefer ha-Zohar, "Book of \nSplendor," composed in the late 1 3th century by Moses de Leon of \nGuadalajara, who claimed its real author was the legendary 2nd-century \nmystic Simeon ben Yohai. He pretended to have the ancient original \nof the book in his possession, but it was never produced. Scholars have \nconcluded that it never existed, and de Leon wrote the Sefer ha- \nZohar himself. 5 \n\nDespite its Jewish orientation, the Cabala exerted a strong appeal \nfor contemporary Christian mystics. It has been much in the favor of \noccultists ever since. Pico della Mirandola even professed to find in the \nCabala what the Jews themselves denied: the incarnation of full \ngodhood in Jesus. He wrote: "No science offers greater assurance of \nChrist\'s divinity than magic and the Cabala." 6 See Hexagram; \nShekina. \n\nl.Lederer, 186. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Cabala." 3. Lederer, 188. 4.

Her consort was the Young God, variously known as \nDionysus, Ganymede, or Cabirius. In Thebes the Great Goddess \n\n\n\n130 \n\n\n\nwas called Demeter Cabiria, sometimes a trinity of "three Cabirian Caduceus \n\nnymphs." Her sexual union with the god was represented by the Caillech \n\nsame symbol as in India and Egypt: water poured from a male vessel ^^^^^^^^^-i \n\ninto a female one. 1 (See Jar-bearer.) Because of its ancient erotic \nconnotations, Cabiria became a common witch-name in medieval \ntimes. \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 324-25. \n\n\n\nCaduceus \n\nSome Gnostic Christians worshipped the serpent hung on a cross, \nrod, or Tree of Life, calling it Christ the Savior, also a title of Hermes \nthe Wise Serpent represented by his own holy caduceus, the scepter \nof two serpents. This was one of the oldest and most revered holy \nsymbols. "The usual mythological association of the serpent is not, as \nin the Bible, with corruption, but with physical and spiritual health, as in \nthe Greek caduceus." To Sumerians it was an emblem of life, \nappearing on art works like the Libation Cup of Gudea, ca. 2000 b.c. In \npre-Hellenic Greece the caduceus was displayed on healing temples \nlike those of Asclepius, Hygeia, and Panacea, which is why it is still an \ninternational symbol of the medical profession. The caduceus is \nfound also in Aztec sacred art, enthroned like a serpent-deity on an \naltar. North American Indians knew it too. A Navaho medicine man \nsaid his people\'s sacred cave once featured "a stone carving of two \nsnakes intertwined, the heads facing east and west." \' \n\nHindu symbolism equated the caduceus with the central spirit of \nthe human body, the spinal column, with two mystic serpents twined \naround it like the genetic double helix: ida-nadiio the left, pingala-nadi \nto the right. 2 \n\nMoses\'s brazen serpent on a pole, the mere sight of which cured \nthe Israelites, was probably a prophylactic caduceus (Numbers 21:9). \nIt was named Nehushtan, and worshipped in the tabernacle up to the \nreign of Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4). See Hermes. \n\n1. Campbell, M. I., 282-84, 286-88, 294-95. 2. Bardo Thodol, 215. \n\n\n\nCaillech \n\nOld Celtic name for Kali-the-Crone, the Great Goddess in her \nDestroyer aspect. Like Kali, the Caillech was a black Mother who \nfounded many races of people and outlived many husbands. She was \nalso a creatress. She made the world, building mountain ranges of stones \nthat dropped from her apron. 1 \n\nScotland was once called Caledonia: the land given by Kali, or \n\n\n\n131 \n\n\n\nCain Cale, or the Caillech. "Scotland" came from Scotia, the same \n\nGoddess, known to Romans as a "dark Aphrodite"; to Celts as Scatha or \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m Scyth; and to Scandinavians as Skadi. 2 \n\nLike the Hindus\' destroying Kalika, the Caillech was known as a \nspirit of disease. One manifestation of her was a famous idol of carved \nand painted wood, kept by an old family in County Cork, and described \nas the Goddess of Smallpox. As diseased persons in India sacrificed to \nthe appropriate incarnation of the Kalika, so in Ireland those afflicted by \nsmallpox sacrificed sheep to this image. 3 It can hardly be doubted that \nKalika and Caillech were the same word. \n\nAccording to various interpretations, caillech meant either an old \nwoman, or a hag, or a nun, or a \'Veiled one." 4 This last apparently \nreferred to the Goddess\'s most mysterious manifestation as the future, \nFate, and Death ever veiled from the sight of men, since no man \ncould know the manner of his own death. \n\nIn medieval legend the Caillech became the Black Queen who \nruled a western paradise in the Indies, where men were used in \nAmazonian fashion for breeding purposes only, then slain. Spaniards \ncalled her Califia, whose territory was rich in gold, silver, and gems. \nSpanish explorers later gave her name to their newly discovered paradise \non the Pacific shore of North America, which is how the state of \nCalifornia came to be named after Kali. \n\nIn the present century, Irish and Scottish descendants of the Celtic \n"creatress" still use the word caillech as a synonym for "old \nwoman." 5 \n\nl.Rees,41. 2.

The Bible says Cain\'s murder \nof his brother Abel was caused by jealousy, after God accepted Abel\'s \nblood sacrifice but rejected Cain\'s offering of vegetable firstfruits. \nFearing to depart from this precedent, the Jews offered blood \nsacrifices to Yahweh up to the early Christian era. \n\nThe Bible story was a Hebraic repetition of the Persian myth of \nAhriman and Ahura Mazda, who offered sacrifices to an elder deity, \nVayu. Ahriman was declared a traitor and devil when his offering was \nrefused. 1 Indo-Iranian priests used to pray the gods to accept their \nown sacrifices, and refuse those of other arya (men). 2 Ahriman was the \nancestor of those other arya, since his original Hindu name was \nAryaman, father of men. \n\nThe myth of Cain was based on primitive sacrificial magic, as \nshown by certain internal inconsistencies. God placed a curse on \n\n\n\n132 \n\n\n\nCain, at the same time protecting him with a mark of immunity. Hooke \nexplains part of the ritual fertility sacrifice: \n\nThe sacrificer is defiled by his act. ...It is this which explains why the \nslayer enjoys ritual protection . . . the most likely explanation of the \nmark is that it represents a tattoo mark or other indication that the fugitive \nbelonged to a sacred class. We have evidence from Hebrew sources \nthat the prophets bore such marks. . . . Tammuz, who bears the title of \n"the Shepherd, " dies, or is ritually slain, during the period of summer \ndrought . . . and his official slayer was obliged to flee in order to remove \nthe ceremonial guilt of the slaying from the community. 3 \n\nSuch comparisons are needed to solve the dilemma of those \ntheologians who, through the centuries, have been helpless to explain \nGod\'s apparent blunder in protecting Cain from nonexistent ene- \nmies, when there were as yet no people in the world but Cain and his \nparents. Actually, the sacred caste of Cainite smiths worshipped the \nGoddess and dedicated sacrifices of the Good Shepherd to her as the \nEarth, who "opened her mouth" for Abel\'s blood (Genesis 4:1 1). \nCain\'s myth reflects the patriarchs\' hostility toward this caste. 4 Eventual- \nly, they drove all the smiths out of their country, and had to send their \ntools to the Philistines for repair because "there was no smith found \nthroughout all the land of Israel" (1 Samuel 13:19). Before the ban \non smithcraft, however, they had the famous Tubal-cain, "instructor of \nevery artificer in brass and iron" (Genesis 4:22). The fraternity of \nsmiths was of Midianite origin, and may have inflicted a certain leg \ninjury upon initiates, which could have been the mark of Cain. The \nHebrew word for Passover, Pesach, meant "to dance with a limp." 5 \nThe festival of Pesach was associated with the Midianites or Kenites \n(Cainites, "children of Cain"), who were famed as miners and smiths, \nand worshipped the Great Mother in the copper mines of Sinai. \n\nAccording to the Sinai tablets, Semitic metalworkers called their \ndeity Elath-Yahu, a combination of Yahweh and El-Lat or Allatu, Lady \nof the Underworld; but she was also identified with celestial Hathor. 6 \nThe Cainites migrated from northern Syria, where their smith god \nformerly occupied the volcanic mountain Jebel-Al-Aqra, a seat of Baal \nin the Ras Shamra texts. 7 The Mosaic Yahweh was a volcano-god \nlike this Midianite Baal, or like limping Hephaestus and Latin Vulcanus, \ngods represented by "a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by \nnight" (Exodus 13:21-22). \n\nExodus 2:16 says Moses was adopted by the Midianite smiths \nthrough his marriage to their priestess, one of the usual sacred \nnumber of seven sisters. Prominent in the clan were such artisans as \nBezaleel, maker of the ark of the covenant, who was filled "with the \nspirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all \nmanner of workmanship; and to devise curious works, to work in \ngold, and in silver, and in brass" (Exodus 35:31-32). The word here \n\n\n\nCain \n\n\n\n133 \n\n\n\nCallisto translated "God"apparently meant the spirit of Elath-Yahu. But \n\nCandlemas Moses quarreled with his Midianite wife, apparently over his attempt to \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ institute the Egyptian custom of circumcision (Exodus 4:25) and \nthey were divorced (Exodus 18:2). Subsequently, smithcraft dis- \nappeared from Israel after a long-remembered feud that imputed the \ncrime of fratricide to Moses\'s followers, though their priestly tradition \nwas to lay it on Cain. The account in Exodus 32 shows that the \nvictims were not shepherds, but Cainites: \n\nMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord\'s side? \nlet him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves \ntogether unto him. And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of \nIsrael, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate \nto gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every \nman his companion, and every man his neighbor. And the children of \nLevi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that \nday about three thousand men. (Exodus 32:26-28) \n\nIn later ages, Cain became a demi-devil, in the view of religious \n\nauthorities who failed to notice that the true brother-slayers were Moses\'s \n\nfollowers. Or, if they did notice, they regarded the killing of three \n\nthousand as less important than the killing of one. In folklore, Cain \n\nremained attached to the diabolized matriarchal tradition: he was the \n\nman in the moon. 8 A German tale said the man in the moon refused to \n\nkeep God\'s sabbath, the Sun-day. Therefore he was sent to the moon, \n\nand a saint informed him: "As you value not Sunday on earth, yours \n\nshall be a perpetual Moon-day in heaven." 9 \n\nl.Larousx, 323. 2. Dume/il.425. 3.

Calliste was an old name for Artemis\'s sacred \nisland Thera (She-Beast). Hellenic writers said the Attic rites of \nArtemis involved young girls dressed as the She-bear, which gave rise to \nthe myth of Callisto, a nymph who lost her virginity to Zeus and gave \nbirth to the bear-child. They were placed in heaven as Ursa Major and \nUrsa Minor. 1 Of course the nymph was the virgin aspect of the \nGoddess herself. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1, 86; W.G, 185. \n\nCandlemas \n\nBecause it fell forty days after Christmas, Candlemas became the \nFestival of the Purification of the Virgin according to the Judeo- \nChristian rule that women must be "purified" forty days after \n\n\n\n134 \n\n\n\nchildbirth, an event which the patriarchs claimed rendered a mother Cannibalism \n\nritually unclean. The Bible specifies forty days of impurity following \n\nthe birth of a son, and eighty days following the birth of a daughter, ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsince females were supposed to be twice as unclean as males \n\n(Leviticus 12:2-5). The Christian God also considered new mothers \n\nunclean, and would not allow a woman to enter a church until the \n\nproper time had elapsed after her delivery. Her ritual purification was \n\nknown as "churching." \n\nThe Council of Trullus once tried to abolish the festival of \nCandlemas, on the ground that in giving birth to Christ, the Virgin \n"suffered no pollution, and therefore needed no purification." \n\nBut Candlemas was not originally a Christian festival. To Roman \npagans, it was the day honoring Juno Februata as the virgin mother \nof Mars. Like the Lupercalia two weeks later, the day commemorated \nthe Goddess who engendered the "fever" (febris) of love. 1 Christian \nauthorities said the pagan people went about Rome with "candles \nburning in worship of this woman Februa." Pope Sergius renamed \nthe holy day "to undo this foul use and custom, and turn it onto God\'s \nworship and our Lady\'s ... so that now this feast is solemnly hal- \nlowed through all Christendom." 2 Still, Candlemas was properly \nconsidered sacred to women and to the Goddess of Love. 5 Among \nCeltic pagans it was the Feast of Imbolg, which stood opposite the great \nfestival of Lammas in the old sacred year. \n\nOmens were taken on Candlemas Day for the new growing \nseason, especially its weather. Therefore animals were said to come \nout of hibernation to provide helpful predictions for the end of winter; \nwhich is why it is now Groundhog Day. An old rhyme said, "If \nCandlemas Day be fair and bright, Winter will have another flight; If \nCandlemas Day be shower and rain, Winter is gone and will not \ncome again." 4 \n\nl.deVoragine, 151. 2.

Hazlitt, 87. \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\nThe most consistently observed taboo in civilized society is the taboo \nagainst eating human flesh, though there is no comparable taboo against \nkilling, which is done regularly, sometimes in enormous volume, as in \nthe case of war. \n\nUpon finding human sacrifice but not cannibalism among the \nPolynesians, Captain Cook called it a shocking waste of the human \nrace, and wrote: "It were much to be wished, that this deluded people \nmay learn to entertain the same horror of murdering their fellow- \ncreatures ... as they now have of feeding, corporeally, on human flesh \nthemselves." 1 Of course the good captain failed to notice that the \nsame delusion dwelt among his own countrymen. Eventually the \n\n\n\n135 \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\n\n\nMethodius 9th-cen- \ntury Greek missionary \nto the Slavs, canon- \nized soon after his death \nby the Greek church, \nand a thousand years \nlater by the Roman. \n\n\n\nChristians taught the Polynesians not to murder their fellow-creatures \nany more, by the simple expedient of murdering large numbers of \nPolynesians until they gave up. \n\nWestern morality has always allowed and encouraged mass killing, \nprovided the dead never became meals for the living. It has been \nnoted that the decline of human sacrifice and cannibalism in antiquity \nwas not accompanied by a decline in human slaughter generally. On \nthe contrary, the scale of warfare steadily increased with the growth of \ncivilization, up to the point where the highly technical civilizations of \ntoday stand ready to exterminate an entire world. Moreover the highest \ncasualty lists have been accumulated in precisely the same nations \nthat call themselves Christian. 2 \n\nChurches, declaring themselves officially opposed to killing, have \nalways managed to justify it nonetheless, when it seemed expedient. \nEven more curious a contradiction may be found on the matter of \ncannibalism, which Christian authorities regarded with the utmost \nhorror. Witches were accused of this crime more than any other, since it \nseemed dreadful enough to deserve the merciless punishment its \nalleged practitioners received. Yet at the very core of Christian faith lay \nthe sacrament upon which salvation, redemption, eternal life and all \nthe rest depended completely: a sacrament of cannibalism, not "sym- \nbolic" but according to its theological rationale, absolutely real. \n\nGod-eating was a universal custom descended from the earliest \nbeginnings of civilization, when it was usually a genuine cannibal \nfeast. As the incarnate god, "the victim is not only slain, but the \nworshippers partake of the body and blood of the victim, so that his \nlife passes into their life, and knits them to the deity in living \ncommunion." 3 \n\nThe object was to become flesh of the god\'s flesh by eating him, so \nas to share in the resurrection of the divine flesh. There is no use \npretending that this "Christian" ceremony did not originate in ceremo- \nnies of real cannibalism as primitive sympathetic magic. All the \nmystery-religions of the early Christian era centered on a pseudo- \ncannibalistic sacrament believed to identify the worshipper with the \nworshipped. "That there was a firm belief in the earlier stages of \nreligion, of such participation in the god by eating him in a sacramen- \ntal meal cannot be questioned. In the Thracian-Dionysiac Mysteries, \ne.g., the celebrants by such a meal obtain a share in the divine life of \nthe god, and so are called by his name." 4 \n\nThe same idea underlay Christian sacraments as well as those of \nthe other Mysteries. Cyril of Jerusalem talked of "partaking of the \nbody and blood of Christ, that you may become con-corporate and con- \nsanguineous with Him; for thus we become Christophori, his body \nand his blood entering into our members." Methodius taught that \n"every believer must through participation in Christ be born a \nChrist. ... He was made man that we might be made God." The same \nsacrament in other religions, however, was a diabolic rite: "Evil spirits \n\n\n\n136 \n\n\n\ngain power by means of the food consecrated to them, and are \nintroduced by your own hands into your own bodies; there they hide \nthemselves for a long time and unite with the soul." 5 \n\nTrue cannibalism was still overtly associated with Tibetan sacrifices \nup to the 7th century a.d., after which the sacred mystery play \nprovided symbolic substitutes. A victim made of dough was torn apart, \nhis "entrails" distributed and devoured. Sometimes, real flesh from \nthe corpse of an executed criminal was inserted into the dough image. \nAt the atonement festival, a bull-masked priest called the Holy King \nof Religion stabbed the sacrificial figure, cut off its limbs, opened the \nbreast and extracted artificial lungs, heart, and intestines. The re- \nmains were scattered by animal-masked dancers, as the remains of Osiris \nand other savior-gods of antiquity were scattered over the earth. 6 \n\nSuch dancers recall the Sabeans (Shebans) of Ezekiel 24, called \n"women that shed blood," who dressed in golden crowns and brace- \nlets to make mourning for the dead, and "ate the bread of men." Similar \nfunerary dancers were the Egyptian muu or "mothers," who wore \nvulture feathers to impersonate the Goddess Mut, or Nekhbet, eater of \nthe dead. \n\nRecently in parts of France it was a custom to make a dough man \nof the last sheaves of the harvest to represent the human sacrifice. He \nwas broken in pieces by the make (an old title of a clan mother) and \ngiven to the people to eat. Similarly in Mexico, after human sacrifices \nwere discontinued, a flint-tipped dart was hurled into the breast of a \ndough man. This was known as "killing the god so that his body \nmight be eaten." In a ceremony called torqualo, "God is eaten," the \nimage was divided into small pieces and distributed among the \npeople. 7 \n\nThis was an obvious survival of Aztec religious ideas. The victim \nimpersonating the god received worship, healed the sick, and blessed \nthe people, always attended by his keeper-apostles. Then he was killed \nand butchered in special houses called calpulli, which distributed him. \nNursing mothers would smear their nipples with a victim\'s holy blood so \neven their infants could partake of it. \n\nThe Greek omophagia was originally a cannibal orgy that even \ndispensed with cooking. Victims were torn apart with the teeth and \nbare hands of the participants and eaten raw. Greek classical writers \npreferred to forget the omophagia. They looked down on barbarian \ntribes for sexual promiscuity and cannibalizing their family members. 10 \n\nWhat was the relationship between eating sacred kings and saviors \nand eating family members? The answers have been given by canni- \nbals themselves: women eat the flesh of dead men and bring them back \nto life as new children. Primitive people reasoned that, in order to be \nborn again, one must get inside a woman\'s body. The simplest way to \naccomplish this was to be eaten by her. This was the original root of \nthe world-wide doctrine of reincarnation: literally, re-clothing in flesh. \n\nBefore discovery of the mechanism of conception, a dying man \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\n\n\nThe original "barbe- \ncue" was a cannibal \nfeast. The word \ncame from barbricot, \nthe grill of green \nboughs on which Carib \nIndians used to roast \nhuman flesh. 8 \nAncient writings often \nspeak of the canni- \nbalistic habits of elder \nraces. The Norse el- \nder gods or giants were \njotunn, from an \nIndo-European root \nword meaning "eat- \ners." They were \nbelieved to eat men, \nlike jack\'s giant who \ndrank the blood of \nEnglishmen and made \nbread of their bones. 9 \n\n\n\nH7 \n\n\n\nCannibalism looked forward to rebirth from one of the tribal mothers who would \n\nconvert his flesh and blood into a new baby. Thus the Massagetae \n_____ __________ considered being eaten by clan mothers the only honorable death. A \n\nman could become flesh of their flesh, and live again. 11 Resurrection \nwas brought about by the mysterious magic of women who, like the \nearth, gave life over and over. \n\nAustralian native women have been known to eat their infants who \ndie, then to paint the bones red and hang them about their bodies: \ncrude magic aimed at returning the child to the matrix and re-coating its \nbones with life-giving maternal blood. Women of the Bibinga tribe \nstated quite plainly that they ate the dead to give them reincarnation. 12 \nIn New Guinea, a newborn child would receive the soul-name of a \nman who was killed and his flesh given to the mother to eat. 13 \n\nIn 1852, Dr. Hubsch wrote of the African tribe called Niam- \nNiam: "As soon as one of the tribe dies, his relations, instead of \nburying him, cut him up and regale themselves upon his remains; \nconsequently there are no cemeteries in this land." H Baganda \ntribesmen said their women sometimes became so hungry that they bit \noff their babies\' ears probably a euphemistic way of saying they ate \nthe whole baby, confident of their ability to give it another birth. 15 \n\nThe notion that pregnancy is the result of eating is still widespread \namong savages. Words for consuming and conceiving are often the \nsame. There was an ancient Babylonian proverb: "Who grows pregnant \nwithout having conceived? Who grows fat without having eaten?" 16 \nAccording to Horace, the real primal scene was not the sexual drama \npostulated by Freud, but "A child, by a fell witch devoured, dragged \nfrom her entrails, and to life restored." 17 The Bible\'s term for birth is \n"coming forth from the bowels" (Genesis 1 5:4), for, like children, the \nancients were not altogether certain of the distinction between repro- \nductive and digestive systems. The Sanhedrin said a woman may \nconceive by drinking or bathing in water used to wash a corpse, an \nobvious survival of the primitive idea of a dead soul entering a new \nmother. 18 \n\nThe Chinese in the Shang period thought birth and rebirth were \nthe same thing. The pictogram kuei, meaning both "soul" and \n"rebirth," was a fetus. 19 \n\nThe Yanomamo say they used to practice cannibalism, because \ntheir mother goddess Mamokoriyoma allowed them to eat dead \nparents and children. But they ceased to worship her, and declared \ncannibalism a sin. Cremation of the dead was instituted. Yet they still \neat the ashes of the dead, mixed with food. Sharing the ashes of \nimportant ancestors is a sacred ceremony thought to strengthen \nkinship bonds. 20 \n\nIn southeastern Africa, when a woman marries into another \nkinship group, she must eat kernels of grain raised on the skull of a \ndead ancestor. When she gives birth, elders watch for signs of similarity \nbetween the deceased and the new baby. Kernels of grain were \nsimilarly grown on the mummy of Osiris and the body of Adonis, who \n\n138 \n\n\n\nwas born in Bethlehem, the "House of Bread." The grain was eaten \nin solemn communion by the god\'s worshippers, who took it to mean \nthey were like him, and would be reborn like him. Hawaiians had a \ngod like Osiris, who was dismembered and buried in many earth- \nwombs. Foodstuffs grew from the parts of his body. 21 \n\nNearly all religions incorporate hidden hints of cannibalism. Apart \nfrom the sacrament of god-devouring that Christianity shared with \npaganism, the primitive church was accused of real cannibalism. Ro- \nmans claimed the Christians sacrificed and ate children, and dipped \ntheir host in children\'s blood. Orthodox authorities didn\'t deny these \ncharges, but insisted only the Gnostic sects were to blame. Justin \nMartyr said the Marcionites practiced incest and cannibalism. Eusebius \nof Caesarea said the Carpocratians did it. Epiphanius said the \nMontanists and Ophites did it. Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, and \nthe 5th-century Presbyter Salvian all blamed heretic Christians for \nholding anthropophagus rites that brought disgrace on the church. 22 \n\nDespite powerful taboos, cannibalism was not unknown in medi- \neval Europe. In periods of famine or plague, when many starved to \ndeath in the streets of European towns, bodies sometimes simply \ndisappeared. In 1435 the Sawney Beane family of Galloway was \naccused of having lived on a diet of human flesh for generations; but \nthey were tortured to death by the court at Edinburgh, which may \nrender their confessions suspect. 23 In 1661, four Scottish "witches" \nwere tortured into confessing that they ate an unbaptized child dug up \nfrom the Forfar churchyard. 24 This seems improbable, since the \nunbaptized were not buried in churchyards.

See Furies; Kingship. \n\n\n\nCaste \n\n\n\nCaste \n\nInventors of the caste system were Indo-European patrilineal tribes \nwhose early migrations destroyed many centers of Neolithic matriarchy; \nyet they had to attribute their social hierarchy to the authority of \nMother Earth, the Goddess of final authority. Their eastern offshoots, \ncalling themselves Aryans, conquered northwestern India and \nbrought a Dark Age to a formerly flourishing civilization, about the \nmiddle of the 2nd millenium B.C. Like the priests of western Europe \nin a later Dark Age, the Aryan priests devised the caste system to \nrelegate native peoples to a lower status, and to preserve this order \nwith a claim of divine ordinance. \n\nThis doctrine taught that all those born into low rank were living \nout a necessary punishment for sin in a previous existence, even \nthough they may not remember it. Their duty was to accept their lot \nwithout complaint, work hard, and obey their superiors, so as to win a \npromotion in the next life. It was perhaps the most effective method of \npreserving a hierarchy that human ingenuity has ever produced. 1 \n\nUnder the rule of the warlike Aryan Aesir, who conquered \nScandinavia\'s earlier matriarchal tribes, "the castes and professions \nare regarded as reflections in the human sphere of the laws of the \nnatural order." 2 The father of Teutonic castes was Rig-Heimdall, \n"King of the Sea-Home." Their mother was the Triple Goddess Earth \nin all three of her forms. \n\nRig-Heimdall lay with Edda the Great-Grandmother, oldest of \nGoddesses, and begot a son named Thrall, "Slave." Then he lay with \nAmma, the Grandmother, and begot a son named Karl, "Freeman." \nThey he lay with Modir, the Mother, and begot a son named Jarl, \n"Earl, prince." These three were ancestors of the castes. \n\nThe same Rig-Heimdall was named Ram, the phallus. He was \nsacrificed as a Horned God. Like Scyld, Arthur, and other pagan \nheroes he was born of the ninth wave of the sea. His Magic Song said \nhe was born of nine maidens, daughters of the Elder Race, another \nmultiplication of the same Triple Goddess, everywhere the Mother- \nBride. The Nine made him strong with the sea\'s cold strength and \nwith sacrificial blood. 3 \n\nRig-Heimdall resembled the Vedic fire god Agni, Son of the \nWaters, who returned to the waters at his death. Some say Agni is \nperiodically reincarnated in the Dalai Lama, another "Son of the Sea." \nThe Rig Veda said of Agni, "He with clear flames unfed with wood, \nshines in the waters." 4 This was not marine luminescence, but an \nallegory of the ancient idea that blood was sea water infused with fire, \nthe element of living heat (see Elements). As the god in dying fertilized \nMother Earth with blood, so fire dying in water turned the cold brine \n\n\n\n141 \n\n\n\nCastration into warm red blood of life. This was the primitive theory behind the \n\n"mating of fire and water" in both Norse and Vedic myth. \n\nhp^ B^BH Apart from the castes in both eastern and western Aryan societies \n\nwere the outcastes: India\'s Untouchables, or pariahs. Their duties \nwere "carrying water and chopping firewood." Their virtue consisted of \naccepting these chores and attending to them faithfully. 5 It is no coincid- \nence, but a tradition of genuine Indo-European origin, that the Bible \nspeaks of outcasts who could not be touched, but were allowed to live \nas "hewers of wood and drawers of water" (Joshua 9:21). Yahweh\'s \nscribes pretended the idea came from their ancestors, but obviously \nit was borrowed from Far-Eastern concepts of the caste system. \n\n1. de Camp, A.E., 294. 2.

Campbell, Or.M., 459. \n\n\n\nCastration \n\nAll mythologies suggest that, before men understood their reproduc- \ntive role, they tried to "make women" of themselves in the hope of \nachieving womanlike fertility. Methods included couvade or imitation \nchildbirth; mock death and rebirth through artificial male mothers; \nceremonial use of red substances to imitate menstrual blood; and \ntransvestism. Another method was ceremonial castration. Its primitive \nobject was to turn a male body into a female one, replacing dangling \ngenitals with a bleeding hole. (See Birth-giving, Male.) \n\nMany gods became pseudo-mothers by this means. Egypt\'s solar \ngod Ra castrated himself to bring forth a race called the Ammiu out \nof his blood. 1 The phallus of the Hindu "Great God," Mahadeva, was \nremoved and chopped to pieces by priestesses of the Goddess. The \npieces entered the earth and gave birth to a new race of men, the \nLingajas (Men of the lingam, or phallus). 2 In a Chukchi variant, the \nGreat God Raven acquired feminine secrets of magic for men by \npounding his own penis to a pudding and feeding it to the Goddess \nMiti (Mother). 3 In Mexico, the savior Quetzalcoatl made new humans \nto repopulate the earth after the Flood by cutting his penis and giving \nblood to the Lady of the Serpent Skirt the Goddess with many shorn \nphalli dangling about her waist, a figure also known in the Middle \nEast, e.g. as Anath. 4 \n\nSeveral forms of the Heavenly Father became creators by a rite of \ncastration. The god Bel cut his "head" (of the penis) and mixed his \nblood with clay to make men and animals, copying the magic of Mother \nNinhursag. 5 Shamin, the Phoenicians\' Father Heaven, was castrated \nby his son El and made the world\'s rivers from his blood, imitating the \nGoddess\'s menstrual magic. Arabs called this god Shams-on, the sun. \nThe Bible called him Samson, whose blindness and hair-cutting were \nboth mythic metaphors of castration. \n\nShearing the sun god\'s "hair" (rays) meant emasculating him. His \nsevered penis represented the son/supplanter; and a penis was often \ncalled "the little blind one," or "the one-eyed god." Greeks\' personifica- \n\n\n\n142 \n\n\n\ntion of the phallus, Priapus, was the son of Aphrodite and her \ncastrated consort Adonis. Their Roman counterparts Vesta and Vulcan \nproduced a phallic god Caeculus, "the little blind one." 6 \n\nUranus, "Father Heaven," was castrated by his son Cronus. \nUranus\'s severed genitals entered the sea-womb and fertilized it to \nproduce a new incarnation of the Virgin Aphrodite Urania, "Celestial \nAphrodite." It was she who ruled the earlier cults of castrated gods, \nsuch as Anchises and Adonis. She was the same as the Canaanites\' Lady \nof the Serpent Skirt: her priests castrated gods in her honor. \n\nSo did the priests of Aphrodite\'s Nordic counterpart, Freya-Skadi. \nThe Nordic Father Heaven was Odin, whose twelfth holy name was \nJalkr, "Eunuch." 7 As a castrated god, Odin was the son-phallus of an \nolder Eunuch personifying both father and son; for Odin was also the \nOne-Eyed God, or Volsi, a "stallion penis." 8 (See Horse.) Like the \nstallion of the Vedic horse sacrifice, he was castrated. A late myth tried \nto account for Odin\'s crude phallic title by saying he could not drink \nof the cosmic feminine fountain of wisdom until he had given up one of \nhis eyes. 9 Here one might recall the alternating seasonal castrations \nof Set and Horus in Egypt, their severed phalli mythologically described \n\n\n\nCastration \n\n\n\nas "eyes.\' 10 \n\n\n\nBiblical writers called the penis a "sinew that shrank," lying "upon \nthe hollow of the thigh." This was the sinew that Jacob lost in his \nduel with "a man who was a god." Jacob, "the Supplanter," was \nanother name for Seth, or Set, who was likewise symbolized by the \nLadder of Souls and likewise engaged in a contest with his rival, ending \nin his castration. 11 When Set was castrated, his blood was spread over \nthe fields in the annual ceremony of sowing so as to fertilize the crops. 12 \n\nThe Book of Genesis confuses the two aspects of the god-king, \nwho as Jacob won his battle with the incumbent king and supplanted \nhim, then as Israel lost his battle with the next supplanter, and was \ncastrated. Is-Ra-El may have been a corruption of Isis-Ra-El, the god \nenthroned as the consort of his goddess, awaiting the next challenger. 13 \nThe syllable El meant his deification. \n\nThe garbled story of Jacob and the god-man was inserted chiefly to \nsupport the Jews\' taboo on eating a penis (Genesis 32:32), formerly a \nhabit of sacred kings upon their accession to the throne. The genitals of \nthe defeated antagonist were eaten by the victor, to pass the phallic \nspirit from one "god" to the next. A king\'s virtu, "manliness," or heill, \n"holiness," dwelt in his genitals because that was his point of contact \nwith the Goddess-queen. Innumerable myths of father-castrating, moth- \ner-marrying god-kings arose, not so much from inner Oedipal \njealousies as from actual customs of royal succession in antiquity. See \nKingship; Oedipus. \n\nThe Greek King Aegeus died at the very moment when his "son," \nTheseus, arrived from Crete to claim his throne. The key to this \nmyth is that Aegeus was "rendered sterile" by a curse, the same ritual \ncurse laid on all kings of outworn usefulness, followed very shortly \nby castration and death. 14 \n\n\n\n143 \n\n\n\nCastration In the sacred dramas of Canaan, the reed scepter of the dying god \n\nMot was broken, to signify his castration. 15 His name, meaning "steril- \n^^ mmmm ^^^^^ ity" or "death," was a title of the fertility god Aleyin (Baal) as he \n\nentered his declining phase, when his rival assumed the sacred throne, \nand he became Lord of Death. 16 The custom of eating the defeated \nking\'s genitals appears in a number of Middle-Eastern myths, e.g., that \nof the Hittite god Kumarbi, one of a line of father-castrating kings of \nheaven. 17 Kumarbi\'s assumption of the fertility-spirit was expressed \nby the story that he "became pregnant." \n\nMythic fathers and sons demonstrated remarkable hostility toward \neach other\'s genitals. Scholars tend to regard this as an expression of \nOedipal aggressions, originating in the jealousy of elder males toward \nyounger, more virile ones. Though men eventually gave up the \nhopeless idea of making one of their number pregnant by redesigning \nhis body in a feminine style, customs of castration and crypto- \ncastration persisted because they offered an outlet for this male jealousy. \n\nAmong savages, men\'s puberty ceremonies generally provided an \nexcuse for elder men\'s attacks on the bodies of youths. Modified \ncastrations may be inflicted in the form of circumcision, subincision, and \nother genital wounds; also a variety of torments such as scarifying \nflesh, knocking out teeth, beatings, torture, and homosexual rape. 18 \n"The dramatized anger of both the father and the circumciser and the \nmyths of the original initiation in which all the boys were killed, \ncertainly show the Oedipal aggression of the elder generation as the \nbasic drive behind initiation." 19 \n\nThe more patriarchal the society, the more brutal its attacks on \nmale youth, as a general rule. Notable for brutality was the Moslems\' Es- \nselkh or scarification ceremony, a complete flaying of skin from a \nboy\'s scrotum, penis, and groin. After enduring this, the victim was \nfurther tormented by application of salt and hot sand, and buried up \nto the waist in a dunghill, making subsequent infection almost inevita- \nble. Burton commented, "This ordeal was sometimes fatal." 20 \nLegman pointed out that both Islam and Judaism "share in the surgical \nintimidation of the son by the father, just at the threshold of puberty, \neither in the psychological castration of circumcision at puberty (Mo- \nhammedanism), or this same operation effected at the earlier age of \neight days (Judaism), or in a reminiscence of this operation." 21 \n\nSubincision provides an example of transition from a female- \nimitative rationale to a male sado-masochistic ritual. As practiced by \nthe Arunta, it began with a long sliver of bone inserted into the urethra. \nThe youth\'s penis was then sawed open with a sharp flint, down to \nthe level of the bone. Blood flowing from the wound was directed onto \na sacred fire, like the menstrual blood of girls at menarche. The \noperation was termed "man\'s menstruation." 22 The wound was called a \n"vagina." 23 \n\nThe obvious purpose of this unpleasantness was to transform a \nmale into a pseudo-female. The mutilated youth was even obliged to \nurinate by squatting, like a woman. Sometimes, men renewed the \n\n\n\n144 \n\n\n\ndamage several times over, repeating the litany: "We are not separat- Castration \n\ned from the mother; for we two are one."\' 24 Natives said the custom \n\nwas begun by an ancestral spirit, Mulkari or Mu-Kari, perhaps a _^^__^^^ \n\ncorrupt form of Mother Kali (Ma-Kali), who was known as Kari in ^""^^^^ \n\nMalaysia. 25 \n\nFar from supporting the Freudian doctrine of penis envy, primitive \ncustoms seem to suggest vulva envy as the original motive behind \nritual castrations. It might be found even in civilized society. Bettelheim \nremarked on the desire of some young men to be circumcised, or \notherwise subjected to bloodletting, when their girl friends were starting \nto menstruate. 26 Circumcision was surely a modified form of earlier, \nfemale-imitative castrations. \n\nThe institution of circumcision was attributed to the same gods, \nsuch as El, who castrated their fathers. Its object was to feminize. In \nIndia, boys were dressed as girls, nose ring and all, on the eve of the cir- \ncumcision ceremony. In ancient Egypt also, boys on their way to \ncircumcision wore girls\' clothing, and were followed by a woman \nsprinkling salt, a common Egyptian symbol of life-giving menstrual \nblood. 27 \n\nCircumcision took place at the age of thirteen, the number of \nmonths in a year according to ancient menstrual calendars, and the \ntraditional age of menarche. After copying circumcision from the \nEgyptians, Jews transferred it to the period of infancy, leaving the \npubertal ceremony, now called bar mitzvah, awkwardly placed at a point \nin a boy\'s life when nothing really happens, in contrast to the sudden \nonset of menarche in a girl. \n\nInfant circumcision was attributed to Moses, who insisted on it \nagainst the will of his Midianite wife Zipporah, who apparently \nobjected to mutilation of her infant. After performing the operation, she \nflung the foreskin at Moses\'s feet, calling him a bloody husband \n(Exodus 4:25). \n\nOther biblical passages show that foreskins were considered appro- \npriate offerings to Yahweh. David bought his wife Michal from \nYahweh\'s representative the king, with 200 Philistine foreskins (1 \nSamuel 18:27). Other Heavenly Fathers made similar demands for \ngenital gifts. Male animals sacrificed to Rome\'s Heavenly Father Jupiter \nwere gelded. 28 The bull representing the castrated savior Attis was \nalso castrated. 29 His blood conferred spiritual rebirth on those who \nbathed in it, like the blood of the Christian "Lamb," as if it were the \nsecret blood of the womb, the real source of life according to the oldest \nbeliefs. 30 \n\nCastration as a means of acquiring feminine powers was still evi- \ndent among priesthoods of the Great Mother, along with other \nfemale-imitative devices such as transvestism. Self-emasculated priests in \nfemale clothing served the Indian Goddess under her name of \nHudigamma. 31 Similar eunuch priests tended Middle-Eastern temples \nlike those of the Dea Syria at Hierapolis, Artemis-Diana in Anatolia, \nand the Magna Mater in Phrygia and Rome. 32 The famous seer of \n\n\n\n145 \n\n\n\nCastration Thebes, Teiresias, got his powers of second sight and prophecy by \n\nbecoming a woman, possibly by castration, and living as a temple harlot \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m for seven years. \n\nPerhaps the best-known self-emasculators in the ancient world \nwere priests of Attis and Cybele, the Great Mother. As Attis was \ncastrated and poured out his lifeblood to fructify her, so his priests in \nimitation of his sacrifice cut off their genitals and gave them to the \nGoddess\'s image. 53 Sometimes, the men\'s severed members were \nthrown into houses, as a special blessing. In return, householders gave \nthe new eunuchs feminine garments to wear. Sometimes, the severed \ngenitalia were carried in baskets or cistae to the Mother\'s innermost \nshrine, where they were anointed, even gilded, and solemnly buried in \nthe Bridal Chamber. 34 The phallus of the god himself was carried \ninto the sacred cavern in the form of a large pine log, which was also, \nlike the phallic cross of Middle-Eastern saviors, the instrument on \nwhich he died. 35 His priests, having copied his self-sacrifice, were \ndistinguished by the androgynous title bestowed on the earliest forms \nof Shiva; they were "lords who were half woman." 36 \n\nTertullian admitted that the "divine mysteries" of Christianity \nwere virtually the same as the "devilish mysteries" of pagan saviors \nlike Attis. 37 Popularity of Attis\'s cult in Rome led to Christian adoption \nof some of the older god\'s ways. One of the best-kept secrets of early \nChristianity was its preaching of castration for the special inner circle of \ninitiates, who won extra grace with this demonstration of chastity. \nThey taught, following the Wisdom of Solomon, "Blessed is the \neunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity." 38 Jesus \nhimself advocated castration: "There be eunuchs, which have made \nthemselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\'s sake. He that is able \nto receive it, let him receive it" (Matthew 19:12). \n\nSeveral early fathers of the church did receive it. Origen was highly \npraised for having castrated himself. 39 Justin\'s Apologia said proudly \nthat Roman surgeons were besieged by faithful Christian men request- \ning the operation. Tertullian declared, "The kingdom of heaven is \nthrown open to eunuchs." 40 Justin advised that Christian boys be \nemasculated before puberty, so their virtue was permanently protect- \ned. 41 Three Christians who tried to burn Diocletian\'s palace were \ndescribed as eunuchs. 42 \n\nThroughout the middle ages, cathedral choirs included castrati, \nemasculated before puberty to preserve their virtue and their soprano \nvoices, which were considered more pleasing to God than the "impure" \nfemale soprano. Women were not allowed to sing in church choirs, \nanyway. \n\nCastration was advocated also for monks who could not fend off \nthe demons of sexual desire. It was forcibly imposed on the monk \nAbelard, whose love affair with his pupil Heloise caused a scandal in the \nchurch. But there were others who seem to have accepted surgical \nchastity on a voluntary basis. Such men assumed the title of Hesychasti, \n"permanently chaste ones," or "those who are at peace." The title \n\n\n\n146 \n\n\n\nwas associated particularly with the monks of Mount Athos, so carefully \nascetic that even to the present day no female creature is allowed on \nthe holy mountain hens, cows, sows, nanny goats, and women all \nequally forbidden. 43 \n\nIt is likely that Mount Athos was named after Attis, and may have \nbeen a shrine served by his eunuch priests in pre-Christian times, \nsituated close to his Phrygian home. There was a Magna Mater figure \nconnected with Mount Athos up to the early 14th century. The \nmonks were labeled heretics for being too deeply involved with the \nteachings of a certain so-called nun named Irene "Peace," the \nthird persona of Triple Aphrodite embodied in her priestess-Horae. \nIrene, as Crone, would have been the priestess of castrations hinted \nin the myths of such lovers of the Goddess as Anchises and Adonis. 44 \nWhen the church purged Mount Athos of the influence of Irene, the \nabbot Lazarus was expelled. With a companion named Barefooted \nCyril, Lazarus wandered through Bulgaria preaching the redeeming \nvirtues of nakedness and self-emasculation. 45 \n\nIt seems the cult of Attis and Cybele continued to influence \nChristianity in the Balkans for many centuries. Balkan monastic \ncommunities were organized in groups of fifty, like older "colleges" of \nthe Great Mother\'s castrated priests. In Thrace, the Great Mother \nhad the name of Cottyto, mother of the hundred-handed giant Cottus, \nan allegorical figure representing her fifty spiritual sons with two \nhands each. 46 Her worship persisted underground, long enough for the \nchurch to define it as witchcraft, and to label Cottyto a demon. In \n1619 a booklet published in Paris suggested the same Balkan tradition of \nthe priest who dedicated himself to God in a manner that was then \nconsidered heretical: "the devil cut off his privy parts." 47 \n\nRitual castration was again revived by 1 8th-century Russian secta- \nries calling themselves Skoptsi, "castrated ones." 48 They also called \nthemselves People of God, insisting that removal of their genitals \nbrought them profound spiritual powers. Russia\'s "mad monk" \nRasputin was a member of this sect. 49 Since Rasputin was famed for his \naffairs with women, few of his contemporaries would Jiave believed \nhim a eunuch; but they had forgotten what eastern harem-keepers knew \nwell enough: that eunuchs are quite capable of providing women \nwith sexual pleasure. Rasputin\'s hold over his female devotees was in \nany case a curious combination of spiritual and sensual obsession. \n\nl.Budge,G.E.2,89,100. 2. G.R.Scott, 192-93. 3.Hays,412. 4.

Like everything else associated with \nwitchcraft, this idea dated back to ancient Goddess-worship. \n\nThe Teutonic Mother Freya rode in a chariot drawn by cats. 1 \nArtemis-Diana often appeared in cat form, and was identified with \nthe Egyptian cat-goddess Bast. The willow sacred to Hecate became a \npussy-willow that bore "catkins" in the spring. 2 \n\nCat worship began in Egypt, where the first domesticated cats \ndescended from a wild ancestor, felis hbyca? Plutarch said the cat was \ncarved on Isis\'s holy sistrum and represented the moon, "[i]ts activity in \nthe night, and the peculiar circumstances which attend its fecundity \nmaking it a proper emblem of that body. For it is reported of this \ncreature, that it at first brings forth one, then two, afterwards three, \nand so goes on adding one to each former birth till it comes to seven; so \nthat she brings forth twenty-eight in all, corresponding as it were to the \nseveral degrees of light, which appear during the moon\'s revolutions." 4 \n\nThe Egyptian word for cat was Mau, both an imitation of the cat\'s \ncry, and a mother-syllable. Cats were so sacred in Egypt that any man \nwho killed one was condemned to death. Diodorus, a first-century B.C. \nGreek historian, told of a foolish Roman who killed a cat in Egypt and \nwas slain in his own house by an infuriated mob. 5 \n\nBast, the Cat-mother of the city of Bubastis, was the benevolent \naspect of Hathor, the Lioness. Festivals of Bast were joyful with music, \ndancing, jokes, and sexual rites. 6 Her dark side was Hathor as the \nleonine Sphinx, Sekhmet (Greek Sakhmis), tearer and devourer of \nmen. 7 "By my life, when I slay men my heart rejoices," she said. Her \nfeast day commemorated a massacre once perpetrated by Sekhmet the \nGreat Cat. The Egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days noted for \nthis one, with inadvertent humor: "Hostile, hostile, hostile is the 12th \nTybi. Avoid seeing a mouse on this day." 8 \n\nMedieval belief in the cat\'s nine lives probably stemmed from the \nEgyptian Ennead, via the mythic figure of the Ninefold Goddess. It was \noften said any witch could assume a cat\'s shape nine times in her life. 9 \nShe could also assume the shape of a hare. 10 Frazer observed: "Cats are \nprecisely the animals into which, with the possible exception of hares, \nwitches were most usually supposed to transform themselves." n \n\nBrought to England, cats were confused with hares as the Moon- \ngoddess\'s totems. The root language of Sanskrit called the moon cacin, \n"that marked with the Hare," but some said the lunar animal might be a \ncat. 12 Queen Boadicea\'s banners bore the device of the moon-hare, \nwhich was also dedicated to the Saxon Goddess Eostre (Easter) at her \nrites of spring: hence the Easter Bunny. Irish peasants still observe the \nmatriarchal taboo on hare meat, saying to eat a hare is to eat one\'s \ngrandmother. 13 Both hares and cats had obviously yonic nicknames: \ncunny, pussy. A rabbit warren is still called a cunnary. 14 \n\n\n\n148 \n\n\n\nTo the Scots, the Goddess of Witches was Mither o\' the Mawkins. Catherine, Saint \n\n"Mawkin" or "malkm" was either a hare or a cat. 15 When the cat \n\nbecame the primary lunar animal, the traditional witch\'s familiar was ^_ ___ \n\nGreymalkin or Grimalkin, a "gray cat." Gray malkins were also the ^^^^^ \n\n"pussies" or "catkins" on the pussy willow, sacred to witches and \nheralding the pagan games of May. \n\nInquisitor Nicholas Remy said all cats were demons. In 1387, \nLombard witches were said to worship the devil as a cat. 16 Christians \nsometimes exposed cats to torture and fire along with witches. At certain \nfestivals, such as Midsummer, Easter, and Shrove Tuesday, it was \ncustomary to burn cats in wicker cages. "The cat, which represented the \ndevil, could never suffer enough." 17 According to Jewish belief, cats \nwere not made by God. The first pair of male and female cats were \n"snorted forth" from the nostrils of a lion on board Noah\'s ark. 18 \n\n1. Turville-Petre, 107; Branston, 133. 2. Graves, CM. 1,115. \n\n3. Encyc.

In the hearts of many people she was second only to the \nvirgin Mary. 1 Yet even Catholic scholars admit her legend is \n"preposterous." 2 \n\nThe key to the secret of St. Catherine is her so-called Catherine \nWheel, the wheel of fire on which she was said to have been \nmartyred. At Sinai, the original center of Catherine\'s cult, the Asiatic \nGoddess was once portrayed as the Dancer on the Fiery Wheel at \nthe hub of the universe. A Greek convent of priestess-nuns at Sinai in \nthe 8th century a.d. called themselves kathari, "pure ones," a word \nakin to the Kathakali temple-dancers of India, who performed the \nDance of Time in honor of Kali, Goddess of the karmic wheel. 5 \n\nThe symbol of the wheel figured prominently in beliefs of medi- \neval Gnostics who called themselves Cathari, and revered St. \nCatherine almost as a female counterpart of God. Perhaps for this \nreason, in the 1 5 th and 16th centuries, after the Cathari were \nexterminated, Catholic prelates made efforts to have St. Catherine \neliminated from the canon. 4 \n\nHer Christian myth made her the standard young beauty dedicated \nto virginity, and so wise she could demolish the arguments of fifty \nphilosophers at once. She refused the hand of the emperor in marriage, \nwhereupon he following the hagiographers\' usual curious pat- \ntern essayed to win her love by having her imprisoned and tortured. \nHer captors tried to break her on the fiery wheel, but the wheel was \n\n\n\n149 \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nshattered by a sudden bolt of lightning and she was saved. In the end, \nshe had to be beheaded. Milk flowed from her veins instead of blood. \nAngels carried her body from Alexandria to Sinai, where her relics were \n"discovered" 500 years later. 5 Her divine bones constantly exuded a \nhealing unguent, which was bottled and sold at great profit to the \nconvent. 6 \n\n1.

The Authorized \nVersion inaccurately \ntranslates sappur as \n"sapphire." 8 \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\nThe symbol commonly opposed to the cross, as the witches\' object \nof worship; in pagan tradition, the Great Mother\'s cosmic womb. As the \n"pot of blood in the hand of Kali," the cauldron signified cyclic \nrecurrence, as opposed to the patriarchal view of linear time. \n\nShakespeare followed the traditional pattern in associating the \ncauldron with three witches, since, from its earliest appearances in \nBronze Age and Iron Age cultures, the cauldron stood for the Triple \nGoddess of fate, or wyrd in Old English: the three Weird Sisters. 1 \n\nThe Egyptian hieroglyphic sign of the threefold Creatress, mother \nof the sun, the universe, and all the gods, was a design of three \ncauldrons. 2 The Norse god Odin stole his divine power from three \ncauldrons of Wise Blood in the cave-womb of the earth, where he \nentered in the shape of a phallic serpent and beguiled the earth-giantess \nby making love to her. 3 Then he drank the magic blood from the \ncauldrons and became a shape-shifter, turning himself into a bird to \ncarry the precious blood back to other gods. This myth was based on \nthat of the Aryan sky-god Indra, who also drank the Goddess\'s ambrosia \nfrom three cauldrons, the three wombs of Kali\'s trinity. 4 Indra stole \nthe elixir by allowing himself to be swallowed by a vast serpent \nrepresenting female sexuality (Kundalini). He too turned into a bird \nto carry the elixir to other gods. \n\nIn nearly all mythologies there is a miraculous vessel. Sometimes it \ndispenses youth and life, at other times it possesses the power of \nhealing, and occasionally, as with the mead cauldron of the Nordic Ymir, \ninspiring strength and wisdom are to be found in it. Often . . . it effects \ntransformations. s \n\nThe cauldron that effected transformations was the same as the \nwomb that churned out rebirths, changing shapes each time. In Babylon \nit was under the control of the Fate-goddess Siris, mother of stars. Her \ncauldron was the blue heaven, where she stirred the mead of \nregeneration. "Siris, the wise woman, the mother, who had done what \nwas necessary. Her cauldron is of shining lapis lazuli. Her tub is of \npure silver and gold. In mead stands jubilation, in mead sits rejoicing." 6 \n\nLapis lazuli was the blue heaven stone prized for its power to cause \nrebirth. The Papyrus of Nekhtu-Amen said an amulet of lapis lazuli \n\n\n\n150 \n\n\n\nstood for the heart (ab), source of mother-blood; therefore the amulet \nwas inserted into a mummy to generate a new heart for the \ndeceased. 7 \n\nChaldean cosmology saw the sky as a nesting of seven vessels, the \nplanetary spheres, like inverted bowls or cauldrons. Beneath the earth \nlay the mirror image of this celestial realm, seven more spheres some- \ntimes described as cauldrons. A Hittite myth called them the vessels \nof Mother Death, dark twin sister of the heavenly Mother Siris: "The \ndoorkeeper has opened the seven doors, has unlocked the seven bolts. \nDown in the dark earth there stand seven cauldrons, their lids oiabaru \nmetal, their handles of iron. Whatever goes in there comes not out \nagain." 9 \n\nEgyptians sometimes saw the seven-circled nether womb as a \nregenerative cauldron called the Lake of Fire. 10 The corresponding \ncelestial vessels were "above heaven." n But the divine cauldron also \nappeared right on earth, within the sacred precincts of the temple. \n\nKing Aeson was resurrected after being boiled in the cauldron of \nMedea, "Mead of Wisdom," eponymous mother goddess of the \nMedes. King Minos too was boiled in the Goddess\'s cauldron and \ndeified in Tartarus, where he became a judge and a Lord of Death. \nUnder the name of Demeter, the Goddess restored Pelops to life in her \ncauldron. 15 According to his inscription at Mount Hermon, the \nRoman emperor Elagabalus was likewise "deified in the cauldron." 16 \n\nSt. John the Evangelist was oddly assimilated to the pagan myth of \nthe regenerative cauldron. He was boiled in it and came forth livelier \nthan before. His symbols were a bleeding heart and a boiling cauldron. 17 \nThe syncretism of the "Feast of St. John at the Latin Gate" \neventually became too embarrassing, and the festival was expunged \nfrom the Christian calendar in I960. 18 The apocryphal St. George, \nhowever, continued to enter the cauldron as one of his alleged tortures. \nBy making the sign of the cross, he rendered it lukewarm and \nharmless, an example of a matriarchal symbol made subordinate to a \npatriarchal one. 19 \n\nAmong the Celts of Gaul and Britain, the Cauldron of Regen- \neration was the central religious mystery: reincarnation within the womb \nof the Goddess. The Irish who worshipped the threefold Morrigan \ncalled the second person of her trinity Badb, "Boiling," the producer of \nlife, wisdom, inspiration, and enlightenment. 20 \n\nTo Welsh bards she was the Goddess Branwen, "one of the three \nMatriarchs of the Island," owner of the Cauldron of Regeneration in \nwhich dead men could be resuscitated overnight. 21 As "a powerful fairy \nqueen," the Lady of the Lake of the Basin, she dwelt in a sacred lake \nfrom which her brother Bran the Blessed raised the cauldron later \nknown as the Holy Grail. 22 This pagan god was Christianized as \nBron, alleged brother-in-law of Joseph of Arimathea who was supposed \nto have brought the Grail to Britain. Actually, the Grail was well \nestablished in British paganism long before its legend was assimilated to \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nLarge cauldrons in \nEgyptian temples were \ncalled shi, the \nprototype of the brass \n"sea" in Solomon\'s \ntemple, which was \ncertainly a Cauldron \nof Regeneration. 12 \nBabylonian temples \nhad the same vessel, \ncalled apsu or \n"abyss," for baptism, \nceremonial lavage, \nand rebirth rituals." \nSuch a "sea" was \nalso called "the Deep," \ntehom in Hebrew.\' * \nLike the Christian \nbaptismal font \ndescended from these \nforerunners, the \ncauldron or "sea" was a \nwomb symbol. \nSolomon\'s "sea" \nrepresented his \nGoddess, Ashtoreth \n(Astarte). It was \ndecorated with her \nyonic lilies: "The \nbrim thereof was \nwrought like the \nbrim of a cup, with \nflowers of lilies" \n(1 Kings 7:26). \n\n\n\n151 \n\n\n\nCauldron that of Christ. 23 Branwen, Goddess of the Cauldron, had yet another \n\nincarnation in medieval romance as Brangwain, the wise-woman who \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m gave Tristan and Iseult their fatal love potion. 24 \n\nThe Goddess had earthly incarnations too. Childeric, son of \nMerovech or Merovig, founder of the first dynasty of French kings, \nmarried a druidess named Basina (Cauldron), who foretold the future of \nhis dynasty. 25 \n\nLike the "seas" in ancient temples, the Cauldron of Regeneration \nalso had its counterparts on earth. Each Celtic temple had its sacred \ncauldron. Aubrey\'s A Natural History of Surrey mentioned a pagan \ncauldron still preserved in Frensham Church, "an extraordinary great \nkettle or cauldron" brought by the fairies, according to local legend. 26 \nAn 8th-century Salic Law against priestesses or, as the church \ncalled them, witches prohibited the pagan practice of "bearing the \ncauldron" in procession to "the places where they cook." 27 \n\nThe Welsh bard Taliesin claimed to have received the mead of \nwisdom from his mother, the Goddess Cerridwen, "the Celtic Great \nMother, the Demeter." 28 \n\nShe resolved, according to the arts of the books ofFferyllt (Fairy-wisdom)., \nto boil a Cauldron of Inspiration and Science for her son . . . which \nfrom the beginning of its boiling might not cease to boil for a year and a \nday, until three blessed drops were obtained of the Grace of \nInspiration. 29 \n\nTaliesin\'s poetry contained oblique allusions to the magic caul- \ndron, couched in the semi-opaque terms that concealed mystical secrets \nfrom the uninitiated. His "year and a day" was a reference to the \nlunar calender of the pagans, a year of thirteen 28-day lunar months, \n364 days, with one more day to make 365. The same "year and a \nday" occurred in many fairy tales. (See Menstrual Calendar.) Talie- \nsin\'s Preiddeu Annwn (Harrowings of Hell) spoke of the Nine \nMaidens, priestesses of the perpetual fire that boiled the symbolic world \ncauldron; and of the yonic shrine, Hel\'s gate, to which the king\'s \nsword (or phallus) was lifted: \n\nIn Caer Pedryvan (four times revolving) \n\nThe Word from the cauldron it would be spoken \n\nBy the breath of nine maidens it would be kindled, \n\nThe head of Hades \'s cauldron what is it like? \n\nA rim it has, with pearls round its border; \n\nIt boils not a cowards food: it would not be perjured. \n\nThe sword ofLlwch Lleawc would be lifted to it. \n\nAnd in the hand ofLleminawc was it left. \n\nAnd before the door of Hell\'s gate lamps were burning, \n\nAnd when we accompanied Arthur, a brilliant effort, \n\nSeven alone did we return from Caer Veddwit. i0 \n\nNine sisters were the same as the nine Goddesses of the \nFortunate Isles ruled by Morgan le Fay, and the nine Muses of Greek \nmyth, and the pre-Hellenic ninefold Goddess Nonacris, queen of the \n\n\n\n152 \n\n\n\nStygian birth-gate. 51 She, or they, came from Oriental traditions almost \nas old as civilization. During their Bronze Age Shang period, the \nChinese represented the Great Goddess of birth by nine tripod caul- \ndrons like the mixing-vessels of the Muses. 32 \n\nThe primitive cult of the cauldron obviously discouraged "cow- \nards" because it was cult of martyrdom. Like Christian martyrs, the \ncauldron\'s victims were promised immediate resurrection into a life of \nglory. Strabo spoke of Cimbrian priestesses who sacrificed men, \nmaking them divine heroes, and caught their blood in magic cauldrons \nand read omens in their entrails. 33 \n\nSome myths hint at cannibal cauldrons large enough to boil a \nhuman body, and beliefs that death in the cauldron was not really \ndeath. A gypsy legend spoke of a hero forced by a mystic Lady to milk \ndangerous mares, then bathe in a boiling cauldron of their milk. A \ngod in the form of a royal horse promised to breathe frost on the \ncauldron and render it comfortably lukewarm. 34 The story recalls the \nCorinthians\' "man-eating mares," or horse-masked priestesses, who \ncaused Bellerophon to mount to heaven on the royal horse Pegasus, \nsymbol of apotheosis after death. 35 \n\nHorseback riding is a sign of deification on the famous silver \nsacrificial cauldron recovered from a Gundestrup peat bog. Manufac- \ntured about 100 B.C., the vessel showed a ceremony of sacrifice. Victims \nappear to be identified with the Horned God, Cernunnos, seated in a \nyogi\'s lotus position holding male and female symbols, the serpent and \ntore. 36 On foot, a row of victims approach the sacred cauldron which \nis shield-shaped and double-lobed, resembling a yoni. A priest or \npriestess is shown plunging one victim headfirst into the vessel. 37 \nAbove, the heroes depart glorified, on horseback, riding literally into the \nsunset, which represented heaven. Cernunnos himself was dismem- \nbered and cooked in a cauldron to rise again, which made him the \nobvious god for such rites. 38 \n\nA scene similar to that of the Gundestrup Cauldron occurs on a \nsacred cista from Palestrina-Praeneste. Rome\'s Mother of Time, \nAnna Perenna, appears to the dying god Mars in the guise of his virgin \nbride, Minerva. She stands over her naked lover and pushes his head \ndown into a boiling cauldron, while the dog of the underworld gate \nlooks on, as also on the Gundestrup example. 39 \n\nSome pagan Mysteries employed visions of the Cauldron as \nsymbolic death and rebirth. Before a Siberian shaman could practice, \nhe was required to undergo hallucinatory experiences of being chopped \nto pieces and boiled in a cauldron, sometimes for a period as long as \nthree years. Yakut, Buryat, and other tribes say the shaman must be \nkilled by the spirits of ancestors, cooked in their magic cauldron, then \ngiven new flesh. "Shaman" comes from Tungusic saman, "one who \ndied," a man assimilated to the Lord of Death called Samana in \nSanskrit. Tibetan shamans made the soul-journey to the "Great Hell" \npictured as an iron cauldron, called House of Iron or Iron Mountain. \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nStrabo Greek \ntraveler, geographer, \nand historian of the \nfirst century B.C., a \nfollower of the Stoic \nfaith. \n\n\n\nCimbri Germanic \ntribes from Jutland, \nwhich Romans called \nthe Cimbrian peninsula. \nIn the 2nd century \nB.C., a Cimbrian army \nmarched against \nRome and caused great \nconsternation in the \ncity. \n\n\n\n153 \n\n\n\nCave \n\n\n\nThere the aspirant was dismembered by rakshasas obsolete ancestral \ndeities and boiled, not in punishment for sin but as an initiatory \nprocedure. 40 \n\nSkald-shamans of Scandinavia made the same soul-journey to \nHvergelmir, the Mighty Roaring Cauldron, source of life-giving \nwaters at the foundations of the earth. This was another version of the \ntriple cauldron in the earth-womb, from which Odin received inspira- \ntion and power. Hvergelmir was triple too, accompanied by the fount of \nwisdom and memory called Mimir (an archaic "mother"), and the \nfount of ongoing life called Urdarbrunner, the stream of Mother Earth. \nFounts and cauldrons in the earth were tended by the three Fates \n(Norns), of whom the first was Mother Earth herself. 41 \n\nEven when the Cauldron of Regeneration entered Christian \ntradition as the Holy Grail, supposedly the chalice of Christ\'s last \nsupper, it was referred to as an escuele or "cauldron." 42 Arthur\'s knights \noriginally sought the Grail in the underworld of Annwn, receiving \ntheir divine vision of it in the castle of Elaine, or Elen, the virgin aspect \nof the triple Moon-goddess. It appeared in her hands, heralded by her \nyonic dove. It meant death for her chosen one, Galahad, who reigned as \na sacred king, then died at the altar as he saw his vision of the Grail. 43 \n\nThe Cistercian Estoire del Saint Graal said "two heathen rulers," \nMordrain and Nascien (Death and Rebirth) were blinded by the \nvision of the Grail, but healed by the touch of the lance that pierced \nChrist, both of these objects being kept in the same sanctuary. 44 The \nmotive seems to have been to belittle the female symbol (grail) in favor \nof the male symbol (lance). \n\n1.

Neoplatonist \nphilosopher, scholar, \nand writer; biographer \nof Plotinus; an \nopponent of the \nChristian church, \nwhich eventually \ndestroyed most of his \nbooks. \n\n\n\nCave \n\nPorphyry said before there were temples, all religious rites took place \nin caves. 1 The cave was universally identified with the womb of Mother \nEarth, the logical place for symbolic birth and regeneration. Etruscan \nand Roman temples featured a subterranean mundus, meaning both \n"earth" and "womb." 2 Similarly, the Sanskrit word for a sanctuary, \ngarbha-grha, meant "womb." 3 \n\nHoly places of Hinduism were caves representing the Great \n\n\n\n154 \n\n\n\nX \n\n\n\nMother\'s yoni. Many gompas (holy hermitages) were first established Cave \n\nin caves. Like the^mountain of paradise, home of the gods, the Four \n\nGreat Caves of Sikkim were distinguished according to the four ^^^^^___^_ \n\ncardinal points. North is the cave of the god\'s hill; west, the cave of great \n\nhappiness; south, the cave of occult fairies; east, the secret cave, from \n\nwhich the sun is born. 4 \n\nAmong the oldest forms of the Hindu Goddess was Kurukulla, a" \nmatrikadevi colored red like the womb, and called Mother of Cav- \nerns. 5 As an emanation of Kali she was worshipped in cave-temple \ncomplexes like Ellora, Ajanta, Elephanta. Her western counterpart \nwas Phrygian Cybele, "Cavern-dweller," the Great Mother of the \nGods. A Latin form of her name was Sybil, the prophetic spirit in the \ncavern-dwelling Cumaean sybils, by whose order the Great Mother of \nthe Gods was brought to Rome in 204 b.c. \n\nCybele\'s castrated priests claimed none of their brotherhood ever \ndied. Instead, they went "down into the cavern" to be united with \ntheir Goddess. Cybele\'s cavern-shrines were also called marriage cham- \nbers, like the pastos of Eleusis. The Alexandrian poet Nicander called \nthem "marriage bowers of Rhea Lobrine." 6 They were also the "sacred \nsubterranean places" where those who had emasculated themselves \nin honor of Attis and Cybele used to come to deposit the offering of \ntheir genitals. 7 \n\nRhea was the Cretan name of the same Goddess, during the long \nperiod when fatherhood was unknown or negligible in Cretan soci- \nety. 8 All life was supposed to have arisen from her uterine cave on \nMount Dicte, whence came the e-dicts of her holy law; hence her \ntitle of Dictynna, Lawgiver. She was also called Britomartis the "sweet \nvirgin," the mother without a spouse. 9 From the same uterine cave \nshe gave birth to Zeus, who later claimed to be Father of Gods. \n\nCave-temples of Rhea Dictynna evolved into dicteria, which the \nLaws of Solon designated public brothels. In the era of the promiscu- \nous priestesses, words for cave, temple, and brothel were often \ninterchangeable. 10 To visit the cave and lie with the holy harlot was \nan act of worship. During the early Christian era, most pagan mystery \ncults celebrated their most sacred rites in caves or underground \nchambers. \n\nFollowers of Mithra considered the cave so essential to proper \nworship that, if the site of a temple had no natural cave, an artificial \none was dug. The cave on the Vatican belonged to Mithra until 376 \na.d., when a city prefect suppressed the cult of the rival Savior and \nseized the shrine in the name of Christ, on the very birthday of the \npagan god, December 25. 11 \n\nDespite the church\'s efforts at suppression, the old deities contin- \nued to be worshipped in sacred caves for many centuries. So many \n"grottoes" contained pagan idols that decorative ideas for cathedral \nsculptures were copied from them: hence the grotesques or "grotto- \ncreatures" swarming in Gothic art. As late as the 1 5th century, Pope \n\n\n\n155 \n\n\n\nCave Calixtus II tried to forbid religious ceremonies in sacred caves. 12 As \n\nentrances to the underworld, caves were still associated with the Great \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ Mother\'s yonic gate. A long-revered gate to the womb of the world \nwas a sea-cave on the southern Peloponnese near the shrine of Mar- \nmari Mother Mari, the Sea-goddess whose other names were \nAphrodite Marina, Marah, and Mary. 13 \n\nUp to the 1 8th century, a cave called Tangrogo in Denbighshire \nwas kept by "three fairy sisters" the three Fates whose footprints \nwere often seen around the edge of its magic pool. The cave was said to \ncontain "hidden treasures," a term that often meant paraphernalia of \nthe Old Religion. 14 \n\nSpenser said the hidden treasures of the Faery Queen\'s Bower of \nBliss were the same as those of the virgin Mary\'s secret "enclosed \ngarden": a magic pool of regeneration, a Tree of Life, singing birds, \napples, and roses, including the central Rose of Love. Andreas \nCapellanus said the grotto of the pagan Goddess was a Palace of Love \nin the center of the earth (in medio mundi), with the male and \nfemale symbols of a Tree of Life and a sacred spring. 15 \n\nSacred caves were still used as "marriage bowers" long after \npaganism had been forced underground literally. Bards who adored \nthe heretical Goddess of Love (Minne) mentioned certain Grottoes of \nLove, hewn by heathen giants in the wild mountains, where people \ncould hide when "they wished privacy to make love." Gottfried von \nStrassburg said whenever such a cave was found, it was sealed with a \nbronze door inscribed La fossiure a le gent amant, the Grotto for People \nin Love.

Ceres\'s greatest annual festival, the Cerealia, was celebrated \nin the British Isles almost to the present day.

Their greatest hero, Talie- \nsin, a founder of their craft, was said to have been born of Cerridwen \nand specially treated by her to a few precious drops of magical \ninspiration from her Cauldron. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 168. 2.

In the classic chakra, each man had his wife or shakti to his \nleft, while the Lord of the Chakra with his shakti occupied the center of \nthe circle. 3 European pagan religions maintained the same arrange- \nment, which eventually became the pattern of the circular folk dance. \n\n1.

He was the \nsecond Constantine. He found it useful to be a Christian, since the \nchurch condoned his wars of acquisition as pagan tribal religions \nwould not and took its share of the spoils, eventually rewarding \nCharlemagne with the crown of the Empire. He was also allowed a \nspecial status of matrimony, not granted to other men. He had four \nwives and innumerable concubines, which the church tolerantly de- \nscribed as "marriages of the second rank." \' \n\nCharlemagne\'s reign was a painful history of aggression against the \nmatriarchal religions of his ancestors. In 772 he massacred more than \n4000 Saxons and destroyed their shrine at Heresburg, an omphalos of \nthe earth-mother Hera. He cut down the phallic tree trunk Irminsul, \n"Column of the World," the same axis mundi that Greeks called the \nGreat Herm, Norwegians called Yggdrasil, and Christians called the \ncross. 2 \n\nAfter destroying shrines to demoralize the pagan clans, Charle- \nmagne imposed vassalage on them and converted them to \nChristianity by the simple offer of a choice between Christ and \nimmediate death. All who rejected baptism were to be slain at once. \nIn 33 years of constant war, Charlemagne built the Holy Roman \nEmpire, at the cost of so many lives that historians have not even \ntried to estimate the extent of the slaughter. 3 \n\nCharlemagne\'s policy of conversion by the sword succeeded so \nwell that the church backed Christian rulers in this kind of military \nactivity ever since. As the Song of Roland put it: "The bishops bless the \nwaters and convert the heathen. If any man protests, he is burned or \nput to the sword." 4 \n\nSometimes the blessed waters themselves served to execute the \nunregenerate heathen. It was said that converts made under the rule \nof St. Goar were held under water until they either accepted Christ, or \ndrowned. 5 \n\n1. Murstein, 143. 2. Reinach, 144. 3. H. Smith, 251. \n4.

The British \nParliament passed an odd law in 1 770 that hinted at the same archetypal \nfears, making it illegal for a woman to "betray" any man into \nmatrimony with such artificialities as false hair, iron stays, high-heeled \nshoes, or perfume. If a husband demonstrated that his wife had used \nsuch devices, the marriage would be annulled, and the woman would \n"incur the penalty of the law now enforced against witchcraft." 2 \n\nWomen\'s singing was also highly suspect, as this was the classic \nmethod of casting spells. "Enchant" came from incantare, "to sing \nover" which also meant incantation. 3 \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 49. 2. Murstein, 227. 3.

The dead were buried with coins in the mouth or on the \neyelids to pay Charon\'s ferry. The Chinese also used to put money in \ngraves, for crossing the river of death. In the Balkans, it was said a \nwoman could make her husband "blind as a corpse" to her adultery, \nif she gave him water that had washed the coins from a corpse\'s eyes. 1 \nCharon\'s fee was Christianized as Peter\'s Penny: St. Peter\'s bribe for \nopening the heavenly gates. 2 In Greece, Charon found a new Christian \nidentity as St. Charus, escort and guardian of souls in the "lower \nworld," or common home of the dead. 3 \n\nl.Frazer,FO.T.,35. 2.

Lamusse, 283. \n\n\n\nCherry \n\nLike many slang expressions, the use of "cherry" for "virginity" may \nbe traced to a mythic past. Like other red fruits, such as the apple and \npomegranate, the cherry symbolized the Virgin Goddess: bearing her \nsacred blood color and bearing its seed within, like a womb. \n\nMaya, the virgin mother of Buddha, embraced the cherry tree Sala \nwhile giving birth to her divine child. 1 Some said the tree recognized \nher divinity and bent its branches down to offer its fruit. The story was \ncarried to Europe and spawned the medieval Cherry Tree Carol, in \nwhich Maya became Mary. \n\nGypsies applied the love-magic of the cherry to many magic \ncharms, especially those associated with virginity. When a gypsy girl \ndesired to attract a lover, she drilled holes through fourteen cherry \nstones on the fourteen nights of the waxing moon, and wore them on \n\n\n\n163 \n\n\n\nCherub a cord around her left thigh (the "female" side). 2 The obvious elements \n\nChimalman of this magic were penetration of the cherry, and building up to the \n\n^^ m mm m ^ m ^ m m mm full moon, indicating growth or pregnancy. \n\nFrench traditions of courtly love perhaps made "cherry" (cerise) \nsynonymous with "beloved" (cherie).

Brit, "Everest, Sir George." \n\n\n\nChristina, Saint \n\nAnother apocryphal "virgin martyr," whose legend was constructed \non no basis whatever, except the name, meaning "a female Christian." \nHer story was one of those sadistic wonder-tales in which Christian \nwriters delighted, piling torture upon torture in fantasies that quite lost \nsight of the natural limitations of human flesh. \n\nFor refusing to burn incense to the pagan gods, Christina was \nlocked up in a tower by her father. She was stripped and beaten with \nrods, then torn apart by hooks, and her limbs were broken. Nothing \ndaunted, she took up pieces of her own flesh and threw them in her \nfather\'s face, saying, "Take, tyrant, and eat the flesh thou hast begot- \nten!" So her father then had her sprinkled with oil and roasted on a \nfire-wheel. Then she was thrown into the sea with a stone around her \nneck. Angels saved her, and she returned to her father, who dropped \ndead of frustration. \n\nChristina\'s torments were continued by a judge named Elius, who \nhad her rocked in a red-hot iron cradle. Her next judge, Julian, threw \nher into a burning furnace, where she walked about unbumed for five \ndays. Then, poisonous snakes were hung about her neck. Then, her \nbreasts were cut off, and her tongue cut out. She took a piece of her \ntongue and threw it at Julian, striking him in the eye and blinding \nhim. Finally, Julian killed her by shooting three arrows into her. 1 This \ncan only have been a magic form of destruction, for Christina had by \nthis time amply demonstrated her invulnerability to every ordinary \nmethod of execution. \n\nIt de Voragine, 366-68. \n\n\n\n165 \n\n\n\nChristmas Christmas \n\nFor its first three centuries, the Christian church knew no birthday \nmttmmmmmmKmmm for its savior. During the 4th century there was much argument about \nadoption of a date. Some favored the popular date of the Koreion, \nwhen the divine Virgin gave birth to the new Aeon in Alexandria. 1 Now \ncalled Twelfth Night or Epiphany, this date is still the official nativity \nin Armenian churches, and celebrated with more pomp than Christmas \nby the Greek Orthodox. 2 \n\nRoman churchmen tended to favor the Mithraic winter-solstice \nfestival called Dies Natalis Solis Invictus, Birthday of the Uncon- \nquered Sun. 3 blended with the Greek sun-festival of the Helia by the \nemperor Aurelian, this December 25 nativity also honored such gods \nas Attis, Dionysus, Osiris, Syrian Baal, and other versions of the solar \nSon of Man who bore such titles as Light of the World, Sun of \nRighteousness, and Savior. 4 Most pagan Mysteries celebrated the birth \nof the Divine Child at the winter solstice. Norsemen celebrated the \nbirthday of their Lord, Frey, at the nadir oi the sun in the darkest days of \nwinter, known to them as Yule. The night of birth, Christmas Eve, \nwas called Modranect, Latin matrum noctem, the Night of the Moth- \ner originally a greater festival than Christmas Day. 5 \n\nEarly in the 4th century the Roman church adopted December 25 \nbecause the people were used to calling it a god\'s birthday. But \neastern churches refused to honor it until 375 a.d. 6 The fiction that \nsome record existed in the land of Jesus\'s alleged birth certainly could \nnot be upheld, for the church of Jerusalem continued to ignore the \nofficial date until the 7th century. 7 \n\nTrappings such as Yule logs, gifts, lights, mistletoe, holly, carols, \nfeasts, and processions were altogether pagan. They were drawn from \nworship of the Goddess as mother of the Divine Child. Christmas trees \nevolved from the pinea silva, pine groves attached to temples of the \nGreat Mother. On the night before a holy day, Roman priests called \ndendrophori or "tree-bearers" cut one of the sacred pines, decorated \nit, and carried it into the temple to receive the effigy of Attis. 8 Figures \nand fetishes attached to such trees in later centuries seem to have \nrepresented a whole pantheon of pagan deities on the World Tree. \n\nChristmas celebrations remained so obviously pagan over the years \nthat many churchmen bitterly denounced their "carnal pomp and \njollity." Polydor Virgil said: "Dancing, masques, mummeries, stage- \nplays, and other such Christmas disorders now in use with Christians, \nwere derived from these Roman Saturnalian and Bacchanalian festivals; \nwhich should cause all pious Christians eternally to abominate \nthem." 9 Puritans in 17th-century Massachusetts tried to ban Christmas \naltogether because of its overt heathenism. 10 Inevitably, the attempt \nfailed. \n\nA curious mistake in the Christmas mystery play of the Towneley \ncycle shows a Great Mother image not fully assimilated to that of \nMary. Before their attention was arrested by the annunciatory angel, \n\n\n\n166 \n\n\n\nidly chatting shepherds complained of their cruel overlords, and Christos \n\nprayed "Our Lady" to curse them. 11 Considering that they were not \n\nacquainted with the Mother of Christ, a rather different "Lady" must ^^^^_^_^^ \n\nhave been intended. \n\nAmong many other superstitions connected with Christmas were \nsome that were typical of pagan holy days, such as the belief that \nanimals could speak human words at midnight on Christmas Eve, or \nthat divinatory voices could be heard at crossroads at the same time. 12 \nAlso at midnight on Christmas Eve, water in wells and springs was \nsupposed to turn into blood, or its sacramental equivalent, wine. The \nmiracle was not to be verified, however; for all who witnessed it would \ndie within the year. 13 \n\n1. Campbell, M.I., 34. 2. Miles, 22. 3. Reinach, 282. \n\n4. H.

In the east, the god\'s lingam or the erect penis of his \nstatue was anointed with holy oil (Greek chrism) for easier penetration \nof his bride, the Goddess, impersonated by one of the temple virgins. 1 \nBefore anointing with oil, the god\'s phallus was often reddened to the \ncolor of life with pigment, wine, or blood specifically, the menstru- \nal blood of his bride. 2 Because kingship once depended on the sacred \nmarriage, anointing became the official rite of investiture for surro- \ngate kings as well as real kings. It carried a promise of godhood. \n\nThe words of the psalmist, "Thou anointest my head with oil," \nevolved from the ancient custom of anointing the god-king\'s penis, \nfor which "head" was a common euphemism. At royal weddings the \nking\'s head was crowned with a wreath of flowers, as in the Hindu \nsvayamara ceremony and flowers, in biblical language, symbolized \nmenstrual blood (Leviticus 15:24). Among the pagans, the temple \nvirgin deflowering herself on the god\'s carved phallus would place a \nwreath of flowers on his head at the same time. 3 Eventually the \nanointing of the phallus was displaced to the head because the marriage \nrite was omitted from public sacrifices of the Savior, Redeemer, Son \nof God, etc. Like the New Testament Christ, he was "anointed" only \nfor his burying: the marriage with the earth (John 12:7). Jesus \nbecame a Christos when he was christ-ened for burial by Mary, the \nmagdalene or temple maiden (Matthew 26:12), who also announced \nhis resurrection (Mark 1 5:47). \n\nAmong the Essenes, a Christos was a priest, specifically designated \nSin Bearer or Redeemer: one who atoned for others\' sins. 4 Among \nthe Slavs, Christos or Krstnik meant a sacrificial hero and also an \n\n\n\n167 \n\n\n\nChthonia "accursed one," due to the ancient practice of laying a formal curse \n\nCirce on the Sin Bearer before he was sacrified. 5 See Firstborn; Kingship. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ 1 .

Leland, 145. \n\n\n\nChthonia \n\n"Subterranean," an epithet of Black Demeter, Cybele, and other \nunderground forms of the Goddess; also applied to gods in their nether, \ndark, Lord-of-Death aspect, e.g. Zeus Chthonios, or Chthonian \nApollo. \n\nCinderella \n\nThe fairy tale of the cinder-maid originated as an anti-ecclesiastical \nallegory repeated by real "fairies" that is, pagans. Ella was Hel, or \nHelle, daughter of Mother Earth, the Goddess with her regenerative \nfires reduced to cinders. Her ugly stepmother was the new church. Her \nugly stepsisters were the church\'s darlings, the military aristocracy and \nthe clergy. \n\nAn early German version of the story said Cinderella\'s real mother \nthe Earth, though dead, sent from her grave a fairy tree in answer to \nher daughter\'s prayer. This tree produced golden apples, fine clothes, \nand other gifts. Thus the "fairy godmother" of later versions seems to \nhave been a ghost of the mother, the dispossessed Great Goddess in \nretirement underground. 1 \n\nBeautified with her new riches, Cinderella won the "prince" \n(mankind), ever easily impressed by the display of finery. Their union \nwas symbolized by fitting her foot into a shoe, a common sexual \nallegory. The Eleusinian Mysteries signified sacred marriage by \nworking a phallic object in a woman\'s shoe. 2 The glass slipper perhaps \nstood for the Crystal Cave by which pagan heroes entered the uterine \nunderworld. \n\nLike other secret medieval prophecies of the overthrow of the rich, \npowerful theocracy, the downfall of Cinderella\'s ugly stepmother and \nstepsisters may have been intended as a prophecy. 3 \n\n1.

Circe\'s isle of Aeaea was a funerary shrine. Its \nname meant "Wailing." Circe herself was the death-bird kirkos, falcon. \nFrom the same root came the Latin circus, originally an enclosure for \nfunerary games. 1 \n\n\n\n168 \n\n\n\nm \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the circle, or cirque, Circe was identical with Omphale of Lydia Circumcision \n\nwith her cosmic spinning wheel: a fate-spinner, weaver of the Cleopatra VII \n\ndestinies of men. 2 Homer called her Circe of the Braided Tresses, ^^__ \n\nhinting that, like Oriental goddesses, she manipulated forces of \ncreation and destruction by the knots and braids in her hair. She ruled \nall the stars that determined men\'s fates. Pliny said Circe was a \nGoddess who "commanded all the lights of heaven." 3 \n\n1. Lindsay, O.A., 239. 2. Graves, G.M. 2, 358. 3.

Originally an imitation of menstrua- \ntion, performed at puberty on boys who were dressed up as girls for \nthe occasion. 1 Circumcision came to be regarded as a sacrifice pleasing \nto a male deity, when it was viewed as a substitute for castration. \n\nl.Gifford,42. \n\n\n\nClare, Saint var. Saint Claire \n\nMythical saint constructed from the title of the Celtic Goddess, \nSinclair, "Sacred Light." \' The original form remained, as a popular \nsurname. \n\n1. Hitching, 212. \n\n\n\nCleopatra VII \n\nOne of the last Goddess-queens of Egypt, Cleopatra followed the \nprecedent of Egyptian rulers in general and turned herself into a \ndivinity. At an Alexandrian festival she "assumed the robe of Isis and \nwas addressed as the New Isis." \' \n\nThough she was not a native Egyptian, but one of the Macedo- \nnian family of Ptolemies, Cleopatra exercised the ancient \nprerogatives of Egyptian queens. Julius Caesar became her lover be- \ncause it was the only way he could annex Egypt to the Roman \nprovinces. By time-honored law, no man could exercise political power \nin Egypt unless he loved its queen. \n\nSome of Cleopatra\'s less eminent lovers lasted only one night and \npaid with their lives for a single taste of her love. 2 The custom seems \nto have been adopted by later male rulers of Arabia, to judge by the \ngynocidal sultan of the Arabian Nights. The thinking behind this \ncustom remains mysterious. It may be that men who lay with the queen \n(and therefore with the Goddess herself) were believed to gain \nimmortality thereby, for any man who coupled with a Goddess would \nbecome a God. Sacred marriage, followed by death and deification, \nformed the basic pattern of many ancient Mysteries. \n\n\n\n169 \n\n\n\nClitoris \n\n\n\nWhen her son Caesarion was born, Cleopatra built herself a \nmammisi or "birth temple" for the worship of her own maternity. In \nthe shrine she was pictured in the act of giving birth, assisted by the \nSeven Hathors. 3 Cleopatra\'s mammisi stood until the 19th century \na.d., when it was described by travelers, but it disappeared in the past \ncentury. 4 \n\nShe also gave birth to the sun and moon, in the form of twins \nnamed Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene Alexander-Sun and \nCleopatra-Moon. 5 Perhaps these children represented her own mating \nwith the solar god of Alexandria. \n\n1.

Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the \nancient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nClitoris \n\nFrom Greek kleitoris, "divine, famous, goddess-like." l Greek myth \npersonified the phallus as Priapus and the clitoris as an Amazon queen \nnamed Kleite, ancestral mother of the Kleitae, a tribe of warrior \nwomen who founded a city in Italy. 2 In Corinth, Kleite was a princess \n"whom Artemis made grow tall and strong," an allegory of her \nerection. 3 Or, again, she was a nymph who loved the phallus of the sun \ngod and always followed his motion with her "head" a transparently \nsexual metaphor. 4 In a bowdlerized version of the story she was \ntransformed into a sunflower, turning to follow the motion of the sun \nacross the sky. \n\nPausanias said the Arcadian city of Clitor was sacred to Artemis, or \nto Demeter, and stood at the genital shrine of the earth, the \nheadwaters of the Styx (or Alph). 5 The meaning of this geographical \nmyth is made clear by the primitive belief that the Styx represented \nMother Earth\'s menstrual blood, source and solvent of all things. In \nthis place, too, the orgiastic priestesses of Artemis were "soothed" out \nof their frenzies; therefore the local omphalos must have signified the \nGoddess\'s clitoris instead of her navel. \n\nLater patriarchal society managed to ignore the clitoris. Since the \nChristian church taught that women should not experience sexual \npleasure but should only endure intercourse for the sake of procreation, \ngrowing girls and boys alike were kept ignorant of female sexuality, \ninsofar as possible. 6 Even physicians came to believe that no clitoris \nwould be found on a virtuous woman. \n\nFrom medieval times onward, virtuous women rarely showed \nthemselves naked to any man, even a husband; so it was perhaps not \nsurprising that men should remain ignorant of the female anatomy they \nclumsily fumbled with in the dark. Pious married couples wore the \nchemise cagoule, a voluminous nightgown with a small hole in front, to \nallow impregnation with a minimum of body contact. 7 \n\n\n\n170 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a witch trial in 1 593, the investigating gaoler (a married man) Clitoris \n\napparently discovered a clitoris for the first time, and identified it as a \n\ndevil\'s teat, sure proof of the witch\'s guilt. It was "a little lump of flesh, ^^^^^^^^^ \nin manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an \ninch," which the gaoler, "perceiving at the first sight thereof, meant not \nto disclose, because it was adjoining to so secret a place which was not \ndecent to be seen; yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a \nmatter," he showed it to various bystanders. 8 The bystanders had \nnever seen anything like it either. The witch was convicted. \n\nEuropean society certainly knew all about the penis, and never \nceased to worship it, evert in Christian times (see Phallus Worship). \nYet the clitoris was forgotten: \n\nAlmost from the very beginning of our lives, we are all taught that the \nprimary male sex organ is the penis, and the primary female sex organ \nis the vagina. These organs are supposed to define the sexes, to be the \ndifference between boys and girls .... This is a lie ... . Woman \'s \nsexual pleasure is often left out of these definitions. If people considered \nthat the purpose of the female sex organs is to bring pleasure to \nwomen, then female sex would be defined by, and focused on, a different \norgan. Everyone would be taught from infancy that, as the primary \nmale sex organ is the penis, so the primary female sex organ is the clitoris. 9 \n\nMedical authorities in the 19th century seemed anxious to \nprevent women from discovering their own sexuality. Girls who learned \nto develop orgasmic capacity by masturbation, just as boys learned it, \nwere regarded as medical problems. Often they were "treated" or \n"corrected" by amputation or cautery of the clitoris, or "miniature \nchastity belts, sewing the vaginal lips together to put the clitoris out of \nreach, and even castration by surgical removal of the ovaries. But \nthere are no references in the medical literature to surgical removal of \ntesticles or amputation of the penis to stop masturbation (in boys)." 10 \n\nIn the United States, the last recorded clitoridectomy for curing \nmasturbation was performed in 1948 on a five-year-old girl. 11 \n\nThe Catholic church\'s definition of masturbation as "a grave \nmoral disorder" in 1976 may have incorporated fears of the effect of \nmasturbation on female orgasmic capacity, now well known to evolve \nthrough masturbatory experience the same as that of a male. 12 Less \nthan a century ago, in the Victorian era, priests and doctors realized that \n"the total repression of woman\'s sexuality was crucial to ensure her \nsubjugation." Leading authorities like Dr. Isaac Brown Baker per- \nformed many clitoridectomies to cure women\'s nervousness, hysteria, \ncatalepsy, insanity, female dementia, and other catchwords for symp- \ntoms of sexual frustration. 13 \n\nI.

Clytemnestra claimed a queen\'s traditional right to choose \nher consort, and have each new one slay the old one. Thus she arrangec \nto have her husband Agamemnon slain by her latest lover, Aegisthus, \nwhose name means Strong Goat. 1 \n\nAegisthus had the right mythic prerequisites for a sacred king. He \nwas born of an incestuous union. His mother Pelopia was a Goddess \nof Clytemnestra\'s clan, the Pelopids. In infancy he was abandoned to \nthe wild, was rescued, and, like Zeus himself, was nourished by a she- \ngoat. 2 He was prepared to be a god on earth. \n\nOrestes spoiled it by killing his mother and her lover, calling down \non himself the inexpiable curse of miasma for his matricide. The \nFuries pursued him, but the god Apollo defended him, on the ground \nthat motherhood was not real parenthood. "The mother is no parent \nof that which is called her child, but only nurse of the new-planted seed \nthat grows. The parent is he who mounts." 3 This Apollonian view of \nparenthood was also the Christian view, even subsequent to 1827 a.d. \nwhen Karl von Baer first discovered the human ovum, gigantic in \nsize and complexity as compared to a spermatozoon. \n\n1.

Actually, \nConstantine didn\'t do this in his own lifetime; his bishops did it \nafterward. Constantine was not so much a worshipper of Christ as he \nwas a worshipper of himself. \n\nConstantine considered himself the incarnation of "the supreme \ngod," a combination of Apollo, Mithra, Jupiter, the sun, and Christ. \nHe called himself "the instrument of the Deity." He said, "I banished \nand utterly abolished every form of evil then prevailing, in the hope \nthat the human race, enlightened through me, might be called to a \nproper observance of God\'s holy laws." He designated for his tomb a \nspot in the center of the cruciform Church of the Holy Apostles, saying \nhe would lie forever with six apostles at his left hand and six at his \nright. A contemporary historian said Constantine was "more greedy for \npraise than it is possible to tell." \' \n\nHe supported freedom of worship in his empire for the wrong \nreason: so that no god would be offended enough to take revenge on \nhim personally. He issued edicts of toleration for all religions, so that \n"we should give to Christians and to everyone else the right freely to \nfollow whatever religion they chose, so that, whatever divinity is \nenthroned in heaven may be well-disposed and propitious towards \nme." He tried to restrain Christian fanatics from persecuting pagans, \nJews, and heretics, writing in an encyclical letter to Bishop Eusebius \nof Nicomedia that these others must be "assured of the same degree of \npeace and tranquility" as orthodox Christians. 2 The orthodox Chris- \ntians did not agree, and soon after Constantine\'s death they instituted \nextensive persecutions and crusades extending over the next three \ncenturies. \n\n\n\n173 \n\n\n\nConstantine I Constantine did his best for the church. In one year he obtained \n\ntwelve thousand converts by the simple offer of a new garment and \n^ mm ^^^^^^m twenty gold pieces to each person who embraced the faith. 3 But he did \nas much for other cults too. He didn\'t become a Christian himself \nuntil the final weeks of his life, when he accepted baptism on his \ndeathbed, as insurance for his after-life. \n\nConstantine\'s life was hardly a model of piety. He murdered his \neldest son, his second wife, his father-in-law, his brother-in-law, and \n"many others," a chronicler said. His first wife, Minervina evidently a \npriestess of the Moon-goddess Minerva mysteriously disappeared. \nNo one knows what became of her. His second wife Fausta was his \nstepping-stone to the throne, according to the ancient rule of the \nhieros gamos. Eulogists at the wedding said, "The title of sovereignty \nhas now accrued to thee, O Constantine, through thy father-in- \nlaw." 4 There being no law of primogeniture, the throne still passed \nthrough the female line. \n\nTo eliminate a potential rival, Constantine killed his eldest son \nCrispus, born of the vanished Minervina. Afterward he accused \nFausta of having had a love affair with her now-deceased stepson, along \nwith other adulterous affairs, and killed her; it seems that any lover \nthe empress took was still a threat to the emperor\'s political position. 5 \n\nThe murdered Crispus might have played the role of savior and \nsacred king, for after his death he was virtually canonized as a \n"blessed martyr." Churches in Greece were dedicated to him for over a \nmillenium. "During the period of the Turkish occupation of Greece, \nover a thousand years later, he was still remembered as the Caesar, the \nhero-prince, the Christian Theseus, as it were, founder of the \nmodern Greek nation." 6 Yet Crispus was neither a Caesar nor a \nChristian. \n\nChristian bishops eventually convinced Constantine that their God \nwould forgive his crimes and enthrone him in heaven. When he felt \ndeath approaching, he said to them: "The salvation which I have \nearnestly desired of God these many years I do now expect. It is time \ntherefore that we should be sealed and signed in the badge of immortal- \nity." 7 So he was baptized, and died in the confident expectation of a \nglorious resurrection. \n\nHis literary whitewashing began at once. Despite his two wives and \nnumerous concubines, Christian panegyrists said he was "wedded to \nchastity." 8 Eusebius elevated all the emperor\'s doings into acts of piety, \nand invented the legend that Christ had converted him with a holy \nvision at the Milvian bridge. Later Christian legend claimed Constan- \ntine saw the sign of the cross in the sky, with the words in hoc signo \nvinces (in this sign conquer). However, the holy sign that Constantine \nplaced on his battle flags was not the cross. It was the labarum, a \nmonogram of Mithra and a sign of the sun, already in use by several \npagan emperors before Constantine. 9 \n\nAs an example of Constantine\'s Christian mercy, Cedrenus re- \n\n\n\n174 \n\n\n\ncorded that once when he was ill, he collected a number of children Convent \n\nto kill them and bathe in their blood as a healing charm. However, \n\nmoved by their mothers\' tears, the emperor spared the children\'s lives ^^^^^__^^_ \n\nafter all, and "the saints" restored his health as a reward for this act of \n\nmercy. 10 No one seemed inclined to criticize him for contemplating \n\nthe massacre in the first place. \n\nConstantine\'s luminous example showed that Christian magic \ncould prevent port-mortem punishment for a ruthless life. "Future \ntyrants were encouraged to believe," says Gibbon, "that the innocent \nblood which they might shed in a long reign would instantly be \nwashed away in the waters of regeneration; and the abuse of religion \ndangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue." n \n\nChristianity served all the emperors after him, with the sole \nexception of Julian "the Apostate," much vilified by the church for \nsuspending the persecutions of pagans and trying to restore the culture \nof classical Rome. But Julian died young; some said he was assassinat- \ned by a Christian. 12 The war against paganism proceeded. Beginning \nabout 330 a.d., pagan shrines were looted and stripped of their gold, \nsilver, and bronze treasures, many of which were carried off to decorate \nConstantine\'s greatest monument to himself, the city of Constantino- \nple. 1? As Eusebius gleefully described the process: "The lurking-places \nof the heretics were broken up . . . and the savage beasts which they \nharbored were put to flight." H \n\nConstantine\'s edicts of toleration were rescinded after his death. \nThe new imperial religion attacked its rivals in a show of intolerance \non a grander scale than had ever been seen before. It was a great \nsuccess. "Forty years after the death of Constantine, the church had \nalready acquired a tenth of the whole of the landed property in Rome\'s \nwestern empire, a figure that in western Europe rose to a third during \nthe middle ages. . . . The church since the time of Constantine affords \nproof that it is not spiritual truth that has triumphed with the spread of \nChristianity but human power." 15 \n\nI. J.H.

Augstein, 299. \n\n\n\nConvent \n\nMedieval institution evolved from the pagan "college" of priestesses \nor virgines that is, unmarried women (not necessarily physical virgins) \ndedicated to divine service. \n\nEarly convents were double: a community of male monks united \nwith female priestesses under the rule of an abbess, usually a \nlandowning noblewoman. 1 "Priests and monks together with the nuns \ntook vows of obedience to the abbess in imitation of the obedience of \nJesus to his mother." A 10th-century Saxon chronicle speaks of double \n\n\n\n175 \n\n\n\nConvent convents inhabited by "priests of both sexes," although in a transla- \n\ntion it was revised to read, "priests of both orders." 2 \nm ^^^^^^^^^^ m As Christian laws encroached on women\'s property rights, many \n\nwomen of noble rank took vows to remain single, so as to protect \ntheir wealth from the claims of husbands. Thus originated the so-called \nconvent of noble ladies, an independent mini-queendom. For exam- \nple, the Saxon convent of Gandersheim in the 9th century held \noverlordship directly from the king. The abbess conducted her own \ncourts of law, kept her own seat in the imperial parliament, and \nmaintained her own standing army. 3 Culture and learning were \npursued. This convent trained the poetess Hrotswitha of Gandersheim, \ncalled "a Sappho, deserving to rank with the fabled Veleda and \nAurinia, ancient German poet-priestesses." 4 \n\nIn the 7th century, a papal bull confirmed the rights of freedom \nfrom taxation and from episcopal jurisdiction of the Parthenon of \nBeatae Mariae et Sanctae Columbae et Agathae (Virgin-house of \nBlessed Marys and Holy Doves and Kindly Ones). Abbesses of Las \nHuelgas ruled sixty towns, had the right to license bishops and priests \nwithin their dioceses, to confer benefices on clergy of their own \nchoice, to nominate ecclesiastical judges, to hear criminal cases among \ntheir subjects, and to establish new parishes. Bishops and apostolic \ndelegates were forbidden to visit churches, parishes, clergy, or beneficia- \nries in the abbess\'s territory. The nuns remained exempt from \nepiscopal jurisdiction all the way up to 1874. 5 \n\nAncient goddess-queens were described as "abbesses" in Christian \nhistories, to disguise the real nature of the pagan matriarchate that \nbacked them. Such a one was St. Odilia or Ottilia, called the abbess of \nOdilienberg (Hohenburg), a pilgrimage shrine of Alsace that was her \nown Holy Mountain. 6 Her legend had no documentary basis. 7 She was \nfraudulently canonized, only to attract her votaries to Christianity. \n\nMany abbesses retained their pagan title of High Priestess \nSacerdos Maxima especially in the German convents. At Quedlin- \nburg the abbess was "in control of the whole town, its people, churches, \nhospitals, clergy, canons and canonesses, and all religious orders." \nShe was not only High Priestess, but also Superior Canoness of the \nCathedral, Metropolitana (mayor), and Matricia (matriarch). At St. \nMary\'s Uberwasser in Munster, the abbess\'s title was Prima domna et \nmatre nostra spirituale, "Mistress-Leader and Our Spiritual Mother." \nCistercian monks at Las Huelgas swore obedience to the abbess as "the \nIllustrious Lady ... my Prelate, and my Lady, Superior, Mother and \nlegitimate administrator in spiritual and temporal affairs of the Royal \nMonastery and its Hospital." 8 \n\nSome centuries earlier, the Latin title of Sacerdos Maxima meant a \nhigh priestess of the Great Mother of the Gods. She was assisted by \nlesser priestesses known as ministra, "ministers." The word "sodality" \ncame from Latin sodales, a college of dancing priestesses trained in \nthe Great Mother\'s temple. 9 \n\n\n\n176 \n\n\n\nThat women in convents long retained the sexual freedom of the Convent \n\nancient priestesses is shown by interchangeable use of the words \n\n"convent" and "brothel" in medieval times. Nicholas Clemangis said ^^^^^^-^^ \n\nthe monasteries were not so much sanctuaries of God as they were \n"abodes of Venus." 10 \n\nThe word nun originally meant a nurse, that is, a priestess of a \nhealing shrine, like the "nymphs" in colleges of Hygeia and Panacea \nin pagan Greece. That the convents continued to function as hospitals \nis suggested by medieval romances: wounded, sick, or dying folk were \nusually cared for by "nuns." n The word also meant a virgin mother in \nGermanic paganism. A cognate was Nana, virgin mother of the god \nBalder. \n\nSometimes, pagan queens established convents in order to have \nthemselves canonized, just as Roman emperors were made gods by \nvirtue of their religious leadership. The canon of saints includes several \npagan queens whose only claim to beatitude was wealth, which \nbought the jurisdiction of an abbey and its subject lands. Some of the \nqueen-saints were even distinctly hostile to churchmen, like Queen \nBathild, foundress of a druidic convent at Chelles in the 7th century. \nShe was the real ruler of the western Franks, having placed her son \nChlotar on the throne. Certain bishops who tried to interfere with her \nwere assassinated. In the end she was "unceremoniously" removed \nfrom power by Christian nobles, and apparently murdered as a heretic, \nthough her subjects maintained her cult and called her Saint \nBathild. 12 \n\nIn Bede\'s time, Queen Ethelreda was ordained High Priestess of \nEly, and was succeeded by other supreme abbesses governing the \nmonastery\'s beatarum regimine feminarum (holy order of women) up \nto the Danish invasion in 866. The abbey of Wherwell was founded \nby Queen Elfrida in 986; it was exempt from earthly services, and held \nmany territories and churches. 13 \n\nAnother pagan princess who founded a convent in the 7th century \nand was canonized, was St. Wereburg of the royal house of Mercia, \nruler of the city of Chester. Her establishment was specifically for \n"noble women" refusing to give up their property to husbands. St. \nWereburg was canonized centuries later, on the strength of a legend \nthat her holy bones had extinguished the fires set in the city of \nChester by marauding Danes. 14 \n\nSt. Hild, or Hilda, of the royal house of Northumberland, estab- \nlished one of the most famous double monasteries of Anglo-Saxon \ntimes at Hartlepool, the "Isle of Stags." Her influence extended over all \nEngland. She created bishops and abbots, favoring especially the \npoet-missionaries of Celtic background. Bede said "all who knew her \ncalled her Mother." 15 Since she bore the name of the pagan Great \nMother Hild, or Hel, one might wonder about the real basis of her \nauthority, in a century when a majority of people had not yet heard of \nChristianity. 16 \n\n\n\n177 \n\n\n\nConvent Even when convents became Christianized, abbesses were still \n\nordained like bishops, and in some areas held more secular power than \n\n^^^^ Bi ^^^^ M bishops, though church histories have tried to conceal this, sometimes \nthrough deliberate falsification of the records. For instance, a papal bull \nsaid the abbess of the Cassian foundation in Marseilles was "or- \ndained"; a later editor changed the word to "blessed." At Jouarre, \nQuedlinburg, Conversano, and other places, an abbess held supreme \njurisdiction over both clergy and laity in her territory. According to the \nRule of St. Donatus, abbesses functioning as Matris Spirituale (Spiri- \ntual Mother) regularly heard confessions. French ecclesiastical records \nsay abbesses gave absolution by imposition of their hands on the \nheads of men. 17 \n\nThe church began to encroach on the rights of convents in the \n12th and 13th centuries, devising ways to appropriate the nuns\' \nproperty and make them subject to male clergy. At Fontevrault, \ncanonesses preceded the monks in processions, carried the pastoral \ncross, preached, read the Gospel, and heard confessions. Pope Innocent \nIII deprived them of these privileges. Disagreements arose between \nmale and female clergy. Monks insisted they would no longer genuflect \nevery time they passed the abbess. Nuns reacted by refusing to kneel \nin the confessional before their brothers. Innocent III also commanded \nthe abbess of Jouarre, her clergy, and her layfolk to subject them- \nselves to the authority of the bishop of Meaux. When the abbess asked \nfor time to prove her right to independence, she and all her \ncommunity were excommunicated. Decrees of the Council of Trent \nchanged church laws to say women\'s orders must be taken over and \nsupervised by men\'s orders. 18 \n\nConsiderable bitterness accompanied sexual segregation of the \ndouble convents, judging from the letter of Abbot Conrad of March- \ntal, on barring women from his order: \n\nWe and our whole community of canons, recognizing that the wickedness \nof women is greater than all other wickedness of the world, and there is \nno anger like that of women, and that the poison of asps and dragons is \nmore curable and less dangerous for men than the familiarity of \nwomen, have unanimously decreed for the safety of our souls, no less than \nfor that of our bodies and goods, that we will on no account receive any \nmore sisters to the increase of our perdition, but will avoid them like \npoisonous animals. ,9 \n\nConvents had been centers of higher learning for women in an \nage when women were forbidden access to schools and universities. \nEarlier in the medieval period, girls as well as boys attended ecclesias- \ntical schools in Ireland and learned to read and write; but this practice \nwas later forbidden, the schools being kept only for males. 20 Premon- \nstratensian and Cistercian orders were famed as educators of women, \nuntil the Council of Trent ruled that women\'s orders must be taken \nover by men\'s orders. 21 Then Cistercian nuns were forbidden to \nestablish any more teaching convents. 22 \n\nNuns were further commanded not to teach or discuss theological \n\n178 \n\n\n\nmatters. This was used as a device for outlawing their orders and Convent \n\nconfiscating their property. It served as an excuse for the Council of \n\nVienne to deprive the teaching nuns called Beguines of their lands \n\nand houses, in 1 3 1 2 when monks of the Inquisition demanded them: \n\nWe have been told that certain women commonly called Beguines, \nafflicted by a kind of madness, discuss the Holy Trinity and the divine \nessence, and express opinions on matters of faith and sacraments. \nSince these women promise no obedience to anyone and do not \nrenounce their property or profess an approved Rule . . . fw]e have there- \nfore decided and declared with the approval of the Council that their \nway of life is to be permanently forbidden and altogether excluded from \nthe Church of God. 2 * \n\nThe Beguines were forced to integrate into orders approved by \nthe pope, where they would receive no education. Their properties \nwere taken over by the Inquisition to provide dwellings and prisons \nfor the inquisitors\' use. 24 \n\nFrom the 1 2th century on, there was increasing pressure on \nconvents to adopt rules of close confinement, to keep nuns segregat- \ned from the outside world. The canonesses of St. Mary\'s Uberwasser \nrebelled three times against the imposition of the Benedictine Rule, \nwhich would force them into seclusion. 25 Many convents were threat- \nened with excommunication, dissolution, or even prosecution by the \nInquisition to force them to accept strict seclusion and to cease develop- \ning the sisters\' minds. \n\nEarly in the 17th century, teacher Mary Ward tried to found a \nCatholic order of teaching nuns known as the English Ladies, to \nprovide education for girls. She and her sisters refused to submit to the \ncloister, so Mary was arrested and accused of heresy. Her order was \nsuppressed in 1629. Pope Urban VIII rebuked them: "Certain women, \ntaking the name of Jesuitesses, assembled and living together, built \ncolleges, and appointed superiors and a General, assumed a peculiar \nhabit without the approbation of the Holy See . . . carried out works \nby no means suiting the weakness of their sex, womanly modesty, \nvirginal purity." 26 With typically patriarchal reasoning, the English \nLadies were punished for doing what women were supposed to be \nunable to do. \n\nA few convents managed to hold on to their pre-patriarchal \nindependence. The clergy failed to turn out the canonesses of St. \nWaudru, at Mons. Monks of Fontevrault likewise failed to take over the \nmain church or the nuns\' house, and were obliged to continue to vow \nobedience to the abbesses, up to the French Revolution. 27 \n\n1. Encyc.

Ravensdale & Morgan, 153. \n\n\n\nCow \n\nPerhaps the most common manifestation of the Great Mother as \nPreserver was the white, horned, milk-giving Moon-cow, still sacred in \nIndia as a symbol of Kali. Egypt revered Mother Hathor as the \nheavenly cow whose udder produced the Milky Way, whose body was \n\n\n\n180 \n\n\n\nthe firmament, and who daily gave birth to the sun, Horus-Ra, her \nGolden Calf, the same deity worshipped by Aaron and the Israelites: \n"These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land \nof Egypt" (Exodus 32:4). \n\nThe name of Italy meant "calf-land." ! This country too was the \ngift of the Milk-giver, whom Etruscans called Lat, Arabs called Al- \nLat, Greeks called Latona, Lada, Leto, or Leda. She ruled Latium, and \ngave her milk (Jatte) to the world. \n\nAll Europe was named after the Goddess as a white Moon-cow, \nwhom the Greeks mated to the white bull incarnation of Zeus. Her \nalternative name was Io, "Moon." Under this name she was presented \nin classic mythology as a rival of Hera, but patriarchal writers were \nalways setting different manifestations of the same Goddess at odds with \none another, possibly on the principle of divide and conquer. Hera \nherself was named Io, ancestress of the Ionians. In her temple on the \nsite of Byzantium she appeared as the same lunar cow, the Horned \nOne, wearing the same crescent headdress as the Egyptian Cow- \ngoddess. 2 \n\nThe Cow as creatress was equally prominent in myths of northern \nEurope, where she was named Audumla; she was also Freya, or a \nValkyrie taking the form of a "fierce cow." 6 A semi-patriarchal Norse \nmyth tried to attribute the creation of the world to the giant Ymir, \nwhose body and blood made the universe. But he was not the first of \ncreatures. The Cow preceded him, for he lived on her milk. 7 \n\nEarlier myths showed the universe being "curdled" into shape \nfrom the Cow\'s milk. In India, many still believe literally the creation \nmyth known as Churning of the Sea of Milk. 8 The Japanese version \nsaid the primordial deep went "curdlecurdle" (koworokoworo) when \nstirred by the first deities, to make clumps of land. 9 The ancient Near \nEast thought human bodies too were curdled from the Goddess\'s \nmilk. One of her liturgies was copied into the Bible: "Has thou not \npoured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?" (Job 10:10). \n\nThe root of "cow" was Sanskrit Gau, Egyptian kau or kau-t. \nGoddess-names like Gauri and Kauri also designated the yonic \ncowrie shell. 10 Brahman rebirth ceremonies used either a huge golden \nyoni or an image of the Cow-mother. "When a man has for grave \ncause been expelled from his caste, he may be restored to it after passing \nseveral times under the belly of a cow." u The Egyptian Goddess as \nbirth-giver typically wore a cow\'s head or horns, as she offered her \nbreasts with both hands. 12 As the nursing mother who gave each \nEgyptian his secret soul-name (re/7), she was entitled Renenet, the Lady \nof the Double Granary, a reference to her inexhaustible breasts. 13 \nThe bovine enzyme rennet, used even in antiquity to curdle milk, was \nalso sacred to her. \n\nA favorite Roman emblem of the Goddess was the Cornucopia, \nHorn of Plenty: a cow\'s horn pouring forth all the fruits of the earth. \nThe cow was honored as the wetnurse of humanity, and her image is \n\n\n\nCow \n\n\n\nHerodotus said the \nmilk-giving Mother \nHera-Io-Latona was \nthe same as Egypt\'s \nButo, "an archaic \nqueen of the Lower \nKingdom." 5 The \nholy city of Buto, \nEgypt\'s oldest \noracular shrine, was \nknown to the Greeks \nas Latopolis, "city of \nLat." 4 Of course \nButo, or Lat, was only \nanother name for \nHathor, or Isis, or Mut, \nor Neith; all \nrepresented "the great \ncow which gave birth \nto Ra, the great \ngoddess, the mother \nof all the gods ... the \nCow, the great lady, \nlady of the south, the \ngreat one who gave \nbirth to the sun, who \nmade the germ of \ngods and men, the \nmother of Ra, who \nraised up Tern in \nprimeval time, who \nexisted when nothing \nelse had being, and \nwho created that which \nexists." 5 \n\n\n\n181 \n\n\n\nCowrie still inadvertently invoked to this day as an expletive Holy Cow, or a \n\npejorative Sacred Cow. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ 1.

Skeletons from the \nSolutrean period, ca. 20,000 B.C., have been found "lavishly decorated \nwith cowrie shells." l \n\nEgyptians decorated sarcophagi with cowrie shells as a rebirth \ncharm. Cowries are still prized throughout the east for their supposed \nhealing and regenerative powers. Cowrie necklaces are valued in India \nas amulets against the evil eye. 2 Moslem women believe cowries \nshould be worn on the body during pregnancy. The Japanese keep \ncowries in wardrobe cabinets "for luck"; if no cowries are available, \npornographic pictures of female genitals serve as a substitute. 5 Gypsies \nvalued a cowrie above all other kinds of protective amulets. 4 Chris- \ntianized natives of the Sudan consider a strip of leather stamped with the \nsign of the cross a valuable amulet; but it is not "strong magic" unless \nnine cowrie shells are attached to it. 5 \n\nRomans called the cowrie shell matriculus, "little matrix," symbol \nof an Alma Mater (soul-mother) or teaching priestess, which is why a \nstudent still "matriculates" into instruction. The Roman Alma Mater \ntaught the philosophy of love as well as the love of philosophy. Unlike \nChristians, the pagans believed the capacity for heterosexual love \nrequired careful nurture and training. \n\nSometimes the Romans called a cowrie porcelk, "little sow," \nbecause it stood for the Goddess who was the Great Sow, like \nDemeter, Astarte, Ceres, Freya, Cerridwen, etc. From porcelk came \n"porcelain," so called because of its resemblance to the white glazed \nsurface of the shell. 6 A Greek word for the cowrie was kteis, which also \nmeant a scallop, a comb, and a vulva. 7 \n\nThe extreme antiquity of cowrie symbolism in the Middle East is \nshown by the ancestor-skulls preserved by the people of Jericho in the \n7th millenium b.c. These forerunners of the Jewish teraphim were \nsevered from the body, provided with features of painted plaster, and \nmade to "see" with the eyes of cowrie shells. 8 \n\nSpeaking of the Melanesians\' and Polynesians\' reverence for \ncowries, a missionary, Rev. George Brown, wrote, "There is some \nsacredness about them, but what it is, is not at all clear. The natives will \nnot talk about them at all." 9 It seems likely that the natives he \n\n\n\n182 \n\n\n\nnentioned had already become well aware that there was no use talking Crab \n\nabout sexual symbols to missionaries.

Condi- \ntions before creation suggest the uterine environment: darkness, liquid, \nstirring or churning movement, the "eternal flux" associated with the \nblood of the Mother (Kali\'s Ocean of Blood, for example). Often there \nis a suggestion of one entity inside another. "When there was neither \nthe creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, and \nwhen darkness was enveloped in Darkness, then the Mother, the \nFormless One, Maha-Kali, the Great Power, was one with Maha-Kala, \nthe Absolute." x \n\nThe Bible\'s highly derivative version says "the earth was without \nform, and void: and darkness was upon the face of the Deep" \n(Genesis 1:2). The Deep was the Mother\'s womb, tehom, derived from \nTiamat, the Babylonian name of the primordial Goddess. In Egypt, \nshe was Temu, mother of the abyssal elements: Water, Darkness, \nNight, and Eternity. 2 \n\nMost creation myths speak of a splitting or opening in the dark, \nformless Mother. The beginning of the existing world is signaled by \n\n\n\n183 \n\n\n\nCreation \n\n\n\nJean Astruc 1 8th- \ncentury French \nCatholic physician \nand scholar. \n\n\n\nthe coming of light. Romans made the connection with birth quite \nclear: Juno Lucina was not only a creatress, but also the Mother who \nbrought "light" to the eyes of the newborn. 3 The biblical God who said \n"Let there be light" (Fiat lux) copied the word of the Goddess. \n\nThe prominence given everywhere to that moment of light sug- \ngests archetypal memories of the first impact of light on newborn eyes \nwhich have never seen light before. Like dreams of the individual \nunconscious, myths of the collective unconscious reveal hidden \nmemories of the birth trauma. "Locked up in the depths of our \nunconscious mind is the terrific impact of birth, the violent adventure \nthat uprooted our pre-natal world." 4 It is also locked up in the symbol- \nism of myths, projected onto a cosmic scale. \n\nCreation/birth was inseparable from the figure of the Mother. The \noldest myths made her the divider of waters, maker of heaven and \nearth. When a god came into the picture, he was at first only her \nsubordinate consort, one of the beings she had created: sometimes a \ndisembodied phallus, in the form of a serpent. Late Egyptian gods who \nclaimed to be creators never succeeded in ridding themselves of \nfeminine imagery. For instance, Khepera insisted that he created the \nuniverse alone, "there was no other being who worked with me." Yet \nhe had to say, "I laid a foundation in Maa," meaning the Great Womb, \nthe Goddess Maat. 5 \n\nOften it is said when the god was allowed to create, he became \npuffed up with pride, and began to ignore his Mother and claim sole \nauthorship of the universe. This angered the Goddess. She punished \nhim, bruised his head with her heel, and sent him down to the \nunderworld. 6 (See Eve.) Sumerian creation myths said when the \nGoddess\'s son-spouse began to show signs of hubris she laid the curse \nof exile on him, saying, "Henceforth thou shalt dwell neither in heaven \nnor on earth." 7 This raises all kinds of questions about Middle- \nEastern sacrificial gods who died in expiation of a primal sin, hung on \ntrees or crosses "between heaven and earth." \n\nGnostic creation myths of the early Christian era were still telling \nversions in which the female principle was pre-eminent, which is why \nthey were declared uncanonical. "In his madness," Jehovah claimed to \nbe the only God, because he had forgotten the Mother who brought \nhim into being, according to one source. The Mother of Gods was \nangry that he had impiously sinned against her, and against her other \nchildren, the male and female Immortal Ones. These were the elohim \nof the Book of Genesis. God grouped himself with them, calling the \ngroup "us" (Genesis 3:22). But Bible revisions tended to erase earlier \ndeities, especially female ones. After the centuries of choosing and \nrevising canonical books, nearly every trace of female divinity had been \neliminated from Christian literature. 8 \n\nAs long ago as 1753, Astruc recognized that the Book of Genesis \n\n\n\n184 \n\n\n\ncontains at least two mutually contradictory versions of the creation Creation \nnyth. One version the scholars call E, for it speaks of plural creators, \n\nlohim, male and female deities. Another version is J, for Jehovah _^____^^^_ \n\ntlohim, the God of gods. The two versions disagree in many points: *^^^^^^^^ \n\nE: birds and beasts created before man. \nJ: man created before birds and beasts. \n\nE: birds made of water, along with fishes. \nJ: birds made of earth, along with beasts. \n\nE: man given dominion over the whole earth. \nJ: man placed only in the garden, "to dress it and keep it," like the \nmen created to be farmer-slaves in the Sumerian original. \n\nE: man and woman created together, after the beasts: "male and \nemale created he (they) them, and God (elohim, the deities) blessed \nhem." \n\nJ: man created alone, before beasts and birds; woman made from \nus rib. \n\nE: creation took place in six days. \nJ: creation took place in one day. \n\nE: nothing was said about the Fall, which appeared only in the \nnarrative. \n\nThe Fall was all-important. If it never took place, there was no \nmginal sin, no necessity for redemption, no Savior. Dean Burgon of \n\nhichester said to deny the literal truth of the Genesis story was to \n\'cause the entire scheme of man\'s salvation to collapse." Calvin stood \niquarely behind what he thought the Bible said, and insisted that all \npecies of animals were created at once, in a period of six normal days, \nach with a morning and evening, as stated. Those who disagree with \nlim, he said, "basely insult the Creator," and will meet after death "a \nudge who will annihilate them." 9 \n\nThe clergy\'s notion of investigating the origins of man consisted \n)f studying the Bible to add up the given ages of patriarchs since Adam. \nThis had been done in the 7th century by Isidore of Seville, who \n:ame up with a strange Bible-based view of history: "Joseph lived 105 \n/ears. Greece began to cultivate grain. The Jews were in slavery in \nEgypt 144 years. Atlas discovered astrology. Joshua ruled for 27 years. \nErichthonius yoked horses together. Othniel, 40 years. Cadmus \nntroduced letters into Greece. Deborah, 40 years. Apollo discovered \nhe art of medicine and invented the cithara. Gideon, 40 years. Mercury \nnvented the lyre and gave it to Orpheus." Reasoning on this level \nind never noticing anything odd about the many consecutive reigns of \nK) years Archbishop Usher in 1650 placed the date of creation in \nK)04 b.c. Dr. John Lightfoot, 19th-century Vice-Chancellor of the \n\n\n\n185 \n\n\n\nCreiddylad \n\n\n\nNicolas \n\nMalebranche (1638- \n1715) French \nmetaphysician who \nattempted to \nreconcile Cartesian \nphilosophy with \nCatholic doctrine. \n\n\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, carried the calculations even further: "Man \nwas created by the Trinity on the twenty-third of October, 4004 B.C., a \nnine o\'clock in the morning." 10 \n\nThe absurdity of such reasoning began to be exposed in 1830 \nwhen Sir Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology investigated the earth\'s \nlong-term changes, showing that creation could not have taken place ii \nsix days, nor in six years, nor even six thousand years. Geologists were \nfinding fossils of animals that lived millions of years ago. Bones of \nextinct species were found in caves, mingled with human bones. \nArcheologists found high civilization flourishing in Egypt in 6000 B.C., \nwith evidence of vastly older savage periods. Cuneiform writings \nshowed that the people of Mesopotamia were telling the same story of \ncreation that the Bible told and telling it thousands of years earlier. \n\nChristian scholars tried hard to refute the new findings. Gosse\'s \nOmphalos claimed all fossils, marks of retreating glaciers, lava flows, \nsedimentary rock strata, etc., were created instantaneously by God witl \nan appearance of pre-existence. Chateaubriand said God deliberately \nfooled men with the false appearance of pre-existence in order to test \ntheir faith. Others tried to explain fossils by calling them God\'s \ndeceptions, formed of "lapidific juice" or "seminal air." u \n\nNaturally these crude views had to be abandoned in the end. \nUpholders of the Bible then tried to call the Genesis creation myth \nallegorical, with each "day" corresponding to a large span of prehistori \ntime. This didn\'t work either. The Bible brought plants into being \nbefore the sun, on which plant life depends; made fish and birds befon \n"creeping things" on land which was hardly the case; and produced \n"light" before the only sources of light, sun and moon. \n\nHowever absurd, these myths still maintain a hold on vast numb( \nof people deliberately kept in ignorance by an obsolete fundamentalisr \nEven educated adults sometimes insist that an omniscient god created \nthe world for a purpose of his own. 12 Malebranche came up with an \noriginal notion, which may have helped the public image of his churcl \nbut made his God look rather less than grand. He said God "can love \nonly Himself and therefore act only with the ultimate purpose of \n\nincreasing His glory Thus the sole purpose of the creation was the \n\nincarnation and the formation of the Church." n \n\nI. de Riencourt, 165. 2.

See Gwyn. \n\n\n\n186 \n\n\n\nCrispin, Saint Crispin, Saint \n\nRoman tutelary god of shoemakers, transformed into a saint by a Cronus \n\n"very late and quite worthless" legend. > October 2 5 , the day of the ^^^aiHHi \n\nshoemakers\' feast among the pagans, was adopted as St. Crispin\'s \nDay. 2 He is still the patron of shoemakers, and his symbol is a shoe. \n\n1. Attwater, 94. 2. de Lys, 182. \n\n\n\nCrone \n\nGeneral designation of the third of the Triple Goddess\'s three \naspects, exemplified by such figures as Kali the Destroyer, Cerridwen \nthe death-dealing Sow, Atropos the Cutter, Macha, Hecate, Hel, \nEresh-Kigal, Morgan, Queen of the Ghostworld, Queen of the Under- \nworld, Queen of the Shades, Persephone "the Destroyer," etc. All \nsuch forms represented old age or death, winter, doomsday, the waning \nmoon, and other symbols of the inevitable destruction or dissolution \nthat must precede regeneration. \n\nThe "Crone" may have descended from Rhea Kronia as Mother \nof Time, though the title has been linked with Coronis, the carrion \ncrow, since crows and other black creatures were sacred to the Death- \ngoddess. Her fearsome character often had a "virgin mother" side as \nwell, because her trinity of appearances was cyclic. It was said in the \nEast that true lovers of the Goddess must love her ugly "destroyer" \nimages as well as her beautiful ones. The Crone also represented the \nthird (post-menopausal) phase of women\'s lives, and her shrines were \nserved by priestesses in this stage of life. Because it was believed that \nwomen became very wise when they no longer shed the lunar "wise \nblood" but kept it within, the Crone was usually a Goddess of Wisdom. \nMinerva, Athene, Metis, Sophia, and Medusa provide typical \nexamples. \n\n\n\nCronus \n\nTitan god who castrated his father Uranus (Heaven) and was in turn \ndeposed by his own son Zeus. Knowing the danger his children posed, \nCronus tried to prevent it by swallowing them all an early version \nof the Slaughter of the Innocents but Zeus escaped. Cronus was \nconfused with Chronos, "Time," because Time swallows up every- \nthing it brings forth actually a characteristic of Cronus\'s mother-mate, \nRhea Kronia, the Goddess personifying time and fate. She was really \nMother Earth, who gave birth to Cronus; and Rhea, who married him; \nand Hera, who married his son Zeus; the three of them comparable \nto the Mother, Grandmother, and Great-grandmother Goddesses in \nnorthern Europe. 1 See Caste. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,37-40. \n\n\n\n187 \n\n\n\n\nCross Cross \n\nThe "Latin" or "Passion" cross, now the primary symbol of Chris- \n^^^^^^^^^ tianity, was not shown in Christian art until six centuries after Christ. 1 \nBut long before the Christian era it was a pagan religious symbol \nthroughout Europe and western Asia. 2 Early Christians even repudiatec \nthe cross because it was pagan. A church father of the 3rd century, \n\n+ Minucius Felix, indignantly denied that Christians worshipped the \n\ncross: "You it is, ye Pagans, who are the most likely people to adore \nwooden crosses ... for what else are your ensigns, flags, and standards, \nbut crosses gilt and beautiful. Your victorious trophies not only \nrepresent a simple cross, but a cross with a man on it." ? \n\nFrom very ancient times, an effigy of a man hanging on a cross \n\nLatin Cross was set up in fields to protect the crops. The modern scarecrow is a \n\nsurvival of this sacrificial magic, representing the sacred king whose \nblood was supposed to fertilize the earth. He was never abandoned, \neven though every farmer knew that no scarecrow ever really scared a \ncrow. 4 \n\nThe cross was also a male symbol of the phallic Tree of Life; \ntherefore it often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital \ncircle or oval, to signify the sacred marriage. Male cross and female orb \ncomposed the Egyptian "amulet Nefer," or amulet of blessedness, a \ncharm of sexual harmony. 5 \n\nThe so-called Celtic cross, with the crossing of the arms encircled \nby a ring, was another lingam-yoni sign of sexual union, known to the \n\nHindus as Kiakra. 6 Some old Celtic crosses still in existence show \n\nCeltic Cross obvious phallic elements, even to a realistic meatus at the cross\'s tip. 7 \n\nCrosses signified a god\'s love-death even in pre-Columbian art of the \nwestern hemisphere, which showed the Savior carrying his cross, an \nimage very similar to the Christian one. 8 \n\nNo one knows exactly when the cross became associated with \nChristianity. Early images of Jesus represented him not on a cross, \nbut in the guise of the Osirian or Hermetic "Good Shepherd," carrying \n\n+ a lamb. Later, many different kinds of crosses were used as Christian \n\nsymbols. They included the Greek cross of equal arms, the X-shaped St \nAndrew\'s cross, the swastika, the Gnostic Maltese cross, the solar \ncross or Cross of Wotan, and the ansated cross, a development of the \nEgyptian ankh, also found as the Cross of Venus. 9 \n\nGreeks said this cross was "common to the worship of Christ and \n\nGreek Cross Sarapis." 10 The Goddess Isis is shown on the Isiac Table with the \n\ncross in one hand, a lotus seed-vessel in the other, signifying male and \nfemale genitalia. 11 As her consort, the god Sarapis was incarnate in \nPtolemy. The words "Ptolemy the Savior" were followed by a cross on \nthe Damietta Stone. Pious Christian scholars once tried to pretend \nthat this phrase was really a prophecy of the future Christ. 12 \n\nFor a few centuries the emblem of Christ was a headless T-shaped \nTau cross rather than a Latin cross. This may have been copied from \npagan druids, who made Tau crosses of oak trees stripped of their \n\n\n\n188 \n\n\n\nT \n\n\n\nbranches, with two large limbs fastened at the top to represent a Cross \n\nman\'s arms. This was the Thau, or god. 13 \n\nA Tau cross was the sign of the holy day aptly named the ^^^^^^^^ \n\nInvention of the Cross, purporting to commemorate the discovery of \nthe True Cross by the empress Helena, mother of Constantine, in a \ncrypt under the temple of Aphrodite in Jerusalem. 14 After it was \ngenerally replaced by the Latin cross, the Tau cross was reassigned to \nSt. Philip, supposedly crucified on a Tau cross in Phrygia, where he \nwas trying to exorcise the god Mars in the form of a dragon. 15 This \nmeans the Tau cross was the sign of May Day, which the church \nadopted as St. Philip\'s day; and the druidic Thau was confused with the \nMaypole. \n\nThe Invention of the Cross was first heard of long after the lifetime Tau Cross \nof the empress Helena. The date assigned to her "discovery" was \n328 a.d., though no contemporary chronicler thought fit to mention \nsuch a momentous event. The legend said Helena found three \ncrosses under Aphrodite\'s temple, but couldn\'t decide which belonged \nto Christ, which to the two thieves. She had a corpse brought, and \nlaid on each cross in turn. When laid on the right one, the dead man \nsprang up alive. According to an alternative story, the True Cross \ninstantly restored the health of "a noble lady who was near to death." 16 \n\nChristian authorities also claimed the empress found the Holy \nNails and the INRI scroll, but the latter somehow disappeared and \nwas lost for over a thousand years. In 1492 it was miraculously \nrediscovered in the Church of the Holy Cross in Rome, where it \nseemed to have been all the time. Pope Alexander III published a bull \ninfallibly attesting to its authenticity. 17 \n\nThe Invention of the Cross proved enormously useful in the \nMiddle Ages, to account for the veritable forest of splinters of the \nTrue Cross revered in Europe\'s churches. There was so much miracle- \nworking wood of the True Cross that Calvin said it would make "a \nfull load for a good ship." 18 \n\nThe church claimed the True Cross was made of the same wood \nthat grew as the Tree of Life in the garden of Eden. It was carried out \nby Adam, and preserved by all the patriarchs in turn (even riding the \nFlood in Noah\'s ark), for the sole purpose of crucifying the Savior \nwhen he appeared. Gnostic sources added an Oedipal twist: Jesus\'s cross \nwas put together by his father, Joseph the carpenter. Moreover, the \ncross was planted on the very spot where the Tree of Life once grew. \nThe church said it became "the Tree of the Cross, so that whence \ncame death, thence also life might rise again." These absurdities were \nimplicitly believed through the Middle Ages. 19 \n\nMale genitals are still called "the tree of life" by the Arabs, and a \ncross was one of the oldest diagrammatic images of male genitals. \nAmong Christians there was at least some recognition of the cross\'s \nphallic significance. An ancient crucifix at Sancreed in Cornwall was \na spear set upright in a holy vase (the uterine vessel) with two testicle- \n\n\n\n189 \n\n\n\nCrossroads like scrolls appended to its shaft. 20 The cross entering the labyrinth \n\nwas one of the oldest symbols of the lingam-yoni in the west, dating \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^_ back to early Neolithic times. Spiral "feminine" labyrinths penetrated \n\nby a cross occur in prehistoric rock carvings from Crete, at Tintagel in \n\nCornwall, Wier Island in Finland, and Chartres Cathedral. 21 \n\nConscious or not, the phallic connotations of the cross appear even \n\nin the present century. In the 1950\'s a poem in the magazine Wake \n\nsaid: "Christ, I have walked around your erection, The Cross, that \n\nbegot, upon a sky of prayer, a billion men, devoted in humility." 22 \n\nDuring the so-called Age of Faith, the peasants were perhaps not \n\nso devoted in humility to the cross as churchmen wanted. Certain \n\nbrotherhoods of "accursed huntsmen" or "archer wizards" constantly \n\ndefaced roadside crosses, believing they could acquire magic skill with \n\nthe bow by shooting three arrows in succession at a crucifix. 2 * Thus they \n\nopposed the phallic trident of the ancient Lord of the Hunt to \n\nChrist\'s symbol. (See Trident.) Today, the cross is often an article of \n\njewelry, attesting an amuletic function virtually indistinguishable \n\nfrom its magical prophylactic use in antiquity. \n\n1. H.

Kramer & Sprenger, 1 50. \n\n\n\nCrossroads \n\nIn the Greco-Roman world, crossroads were sacred to the elder \nDiana under the name of Hecate Trevia (Hecate of the Three Ways), \nmother of the Lares compitales, "spirits of the crossroads." Travelers \nmade offerings to the Goddess\'s three-faced images, and regular festivals \ncalled Compitalia were celebrated at her roadside shrines. 1 \n\nFour-way crossroads were sometimes dedicated to Hermes, whose \nithyphallic herms stood beside them until replaced by Christians\' \nroadside crosses. However, the Christian sign of the cross was copied \nfrom Hermes\'s cult and traced his sacred numeral 4 on the worship- \nper\'s head and breast. Hermetic crosses were left at the crossroads of \n10th-century Ireland and simply re-interpreted as Christian symbols, \nthough they plainly displayed the twin serpents of the pagan caduceus, \nanother sign of the older deity. 2 \n\nCross, herm, and caduceus merged in northern symbolism with \nthe gallows tree of Odin/ Wotan, "God of the Hanged," which led to \nthe Christian custom of erecting a gallows at crossroads as well as a \ncrucifix. The god on the gallows once played the same role as Jesus \non the cross: a dying-god image rendered the crossroad numinous. Pre- \nChristian Europeans held waymeets, or moots, at crossroads to \ninvoke their deities\' attention to the proceedings; hence a moot point \n\n\n\n190 \n\n\n\nused to be one to be decided at a meet. The Goddess as Mother \nEarth, dispenser of "natural law" and creatress of birth-and-death \ncycles, was always present where the dying god died as the women \nlong remembered. The English monk Aelfric complained of female \ncustoms dedicating newborn infants to the ancient Mother. Women \nwould "go to the crossways and drag their children over the earth, and \nthereby give both themselves and their children to the Devil." 3 \n\nAs the crossroad ceremonies and their deities became diabolized, \nthe Goddess of the waymeet became the queen of witches, who still \nworked magic there. The Key of Solomon said crossroads were the best \nof all places for magical procedures "during the depth and silence of \nthe night." 4 Ghosts of the hanged, of the heathen, and of ancient \naracles still haunted crossroads. Bernard Ragner said a spirit voice \nwould foretell the future to anyone who went to a crossroad at the last \nhour of Christmas Eve. As late as the 1920\'s, English farmers still \nrelieved witches\' sabbats were held at crossroads. Necromantic supersti- \n:ions were encouraged by the custom of burying criminals and \nsuicides in unhallowed ground at crossroads; clergymen said anyone so \njuried would walk as a ghost. Sometimes, such corpses were pinned \ndown with a stake: "A stake was driven through them when deposited at \n:he cross-roads in order to keep the ghost from wandering abroad." 5 \nPresumably, the ghost could be consulted in situ, just as spirits could be \naised from their graves in the churchyard by any necromancer. \n\nThus Hermes and Hecate, who led the souls of the dead in \nantiquity, became dread spirits of "witchcraft" in the same places that \nhey once benevolently ruled. \n\n\n\nCrow \n\n\n\n1.

Wedeck, 153. \n\n\n\nCrow \n\n\\long with the vulture and raven, the carrion-eating crow was \nborthern Europe\'s common symbol of the Death-goddess. Valkyries, \npometimes described as man-eating women, often took totemic form \nas ravens or crows. 1 \n\nAnglo-Danish myths spoke of a witch named Krake (Crow), \ndaughter of the Valkyrie Brunnhilde. Krake was a shape-shifter: at \n:imes a beautiful virgin, at other times a hag, monster, or crow. She \nnamed the Danish king Ragnar Lodbrok (Leather-Breeches), and \njave birth to the hero Sigurd. 2 Sigurd was the same as Siegfried, whose \nnystic lady-love was the Valkyrie Brunnhilde; thus appeared the \name convoluted incestuous relationships found in the oldest myths of \nacred kingship. Again, the Triple Goddess returned as the three \nirophetic daughters of Ragnar and Krake, Fate-weavers who created \nhe magic banner called Raven (Hraefn). 3 \n\nThere was a mythological Kraken associated with the sea, pictured \nis a serpent or water-monster; but this was only another form of the \n\n\n\nKey of Solomon \n\n(Clavicule de Salomon) \nA popular "Black \nBook" or magic book \nmuch used between the \n11th and Bthcentu- \n\n\n\nBernard Ragner \n\nAuthor of Legends and \nCustoms of Christmas, \n1925 \n\n\n\n191 \n\n\n\nCrusades same Death-goddess. The Three Ravens (Kraken) in old ballads were \n\nbirds of doom perching over the slain hero. Sometimes there were \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ m only two of them, as in the ballad of the Twa Corbies (Two Crows), \nwho proposed to pluck out the bonny blue eyes of the slain knight. 4 \n\nSuch manifestations of the Goddess as a crow might be linked wit \nCoronis, "Crow," a death aspect of the pre-Hellenic earth mother \nRhea. Classical mythographers tended to ignore Coronis, rememberinj \nher only as the virgin mother of the healing god Asclepius; but she \nseems to have been another of the Virgin-Crone combinations: Rhea \nKronia as Mother Time who brings death to all things. 5 \n\n1 .

Graves, GM. 1, 175; 2, 387. \n\n\n\nCrusades \n\n"Holy wars" designed to wrest property away from the heathen or \nheretic enemies of orthodox Christianity. Crusades were usually fough \nby vassals of Christian overlords, including the wealthy clergy. War- \nriors were promised not only the standard soldiers\' spoils, but also \nindulgences, like instant remission of sins and admission to heaven \nguaranteed no matter what crimes the crusader may have committed. \n\nFrom the 8th to 10th centuries, the Holy Roman Empire was \nharassed by Norsemen, who owned many northern trading centers \nand dominated the seas. They also opened negotiations with foreign \npowers in North Africa and the Middle East. In 834, Arabian legates \nvisited Denmark to contract military and trade alliances. 1 The Holy \nRoman Empire saw itself trapped between two anti-Christian forces: \nthe pagan Normans in the northwest, and the Moslem Saracens in the \nsoutheast. Norsemen controlled trade routes through the Danube \nand Black Sea to the Turks, and were acquiring hoards of Arabic silver \ngold, and gems. They also sailed the Atlantic coasts down to Gibral- \ntar, and founded colonies in Libya. The Kingdom of God was nearly \nencircled. \n\nPope Urban II tried to solve the problem by initiating crusades in \nthe east, on the pretext of converting the Saracens\' possessions in the \n"Holy Land" into Christian fiefs. In 1095 he instigated the People\'s \nCrusade as a combination of penitential pilgrimage and a war of \nconquest. It was advertised throughout Europe. All who participated \nwere placed above restrictions of law, and promised forgiveness of \nsins and eternal bliss in heaven without any time spent in purgatory. \n\nA rabble of some 1 50,000 to 300,000 persons, mostly the dregs c \nsociety mixed with military mercenaries, set out across southern \nEurope, killing, torturing, and looting as they went. One division \nslaughtered 10,000 Jews in the Rhineland, then forgot about the \nHoly Land and dispersed. Two other divisions did so much harm in \nHungary that native soldiers rose up against them and destroyed \nthem all. Multitudes died along the way, of sickness, hunger, or injurie \n\n\n\n192 \n\n\n\n\nbrought on by their violence. A remnant survived to plunder the too- Crusades \n\nhospitable Greeks, then to enter Constantinople. There, stronger \n\ncrusaders sold off the weaker ones as slaves, to finance their own ^^^^^_^_^_ \n\nprovisions. Finally, a remaining 7,000 or so crossed the Bosporus and \n\nwere attacked by the Turks, who soon killed them all. 2 \n\nOne might think the fate of Pope Urban\'s crusade would have \ndiscouraged future experiments of this kind. Not so. It seems to have \nbeen an idea whose time had come. \n\nLater crusades were better organized, with more experienced \nsoldiers and fewer penitential pilgrims. Their primary motive was \nloot. For the next 400 years, Christian knights went forth to astonish the \nSaracens with their intellectual naYvete and their military sophistica- \ntion, developed in a feudal society based on warfare. \n\nThe Crusaders in general, in spite of their sacred cause, behaved like \nhighway robbers. The first host which set out in 1095, and was \nannihilated by the Turks at Nicaea, killed, burned and pillaged all they \nencountered. The army commanded by Godfrey de Bouillon massa- \ncred the entire population of Jerusalem (1098). The astuteness of Venice \nturned aside the fourth Crusade upon Constantinople, and the sack of \nthis city is a dark blot on the history of Western Christendom (1204). It \nwas abominably ravaged, and the very church of St. Sophia was the \nscene of bloody and sacrilegious orgies. * \n\nA contemporary chronicler said Jerusalem withstood a month\'s \nsiege. Upon its fall, crusaders rode into the city with their horses wading \n"knee-deep in the blood of disbelievers." Jews were herded into their \nsynagogues and burned alive. On the next day, the knights slaughtered \n"a great multitude of people of every age, old men and women, \nmaidens, children and mothers with infants, by way of a solemn \nsacrifice" to Jesus. 4 At the battle of Acre, Richard Coeur de Lion \nviolated his pledge of truce, and had his hostages slaughtered and flayed. \n"His conduct stands in strong contrast with the dignity and forbear- \nance of Saladin, before whose eyes the outrage was committed, and who \nwould not stoop to retaliate on his dastardly opponent." 5 \n\nOnce the crusading system was established, it was turned on other \nenemies of the church closer to home and became the standard \nmethod for dealing with European heathens and heretics. Between \n1236 and 1283 a crusade of extermination was preached against the \npagan Prussians by Pope Honorius, and carried out by the Teutonic \nKnights. The Christian Brethren of the Sword similarly converted \nLivonia and Courland. Armies of the Christian Dukes of Poland forced \nthe Wends to accept Christian baptism and vassalage. The Lithua- \nnians stubbornly clung to their paganism to the end of the 14th century, \nbut eventually they too were Christianized by the sword. 6 \n\nIt was noticed in the 1 3th century that the semi-barbarous Ste- \ndingers of the lower Weser river maintained their ancient tribal \nsystem, paid no attention to the church, and contributed no tithes. Pope \nGregory IX sent bulls to the bishops of Minden, Lubeck, and \n\n\n\n193 \n\n\n\nCrusades Verden, ordering crusades against these recalcitrant peasants, whom he \n\ndescribed as heretics because they consulted wise-women, made \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ waxen images, and worshipped "demons." Crusaders were promised \nblanket pardon for their sins. However, the Stedingers fought back \nstubbornly, and several campaigns against them failed. At last in 1234 a \nhuge army marched into their land, ravaged every home with fire and \nsword, and wiped them out. Their property was divided between the \nchurch and the barons. 7 \n\nIt has been estimated that Europe was Christianized at a cost of \nabout 8 million to 10 million lives. 8 Even after nominal conversion, \nthere was much residual resistance to the new cult, which was alien and \nunappealing to the people it was imposed on. The clergy claimed \nauthority from an unfamiliar eastern savior and his God, defaming all \nthe pagans\' local, ancestral deities many worshipped since the \nNeolithic age as demons. Moreover, familiar laws and lifestyle were \ndeclared wholly sinful. It\'s hardly surprising that there arose heresy \nafter heresy to confront the conquering church, which became increas- \ningly fanatical in its dictatorial policies, yet in the end failed to \novercome the people\'s need to assert their own religious heterodoxy. 9 \nMany refused to give up their pagan Goddess, or their notion that \nsexuality contained an element of the divine. Many remembered a time, \nnot so long before, when "holy communion" was a taste of divine \nbliss through sensual pleasures: an idea that was especially prevalent in \nthe south of France. \n\nCrusades against the Catharan or Albigensian heretics of southern \nFrance were particularly virulent, since these people were prosperous \nenough to attract plunderers, and bitterly opposed to the Roman \nchurch, which they called the Synagogue of Satan. They condemned \nits worship of holy images as idolatry, denied the power of its sacra- \nments, scoffed at the Trinity, insisted on reading the Bible for \nthemselves, and revived the old Gnostic belief that the Jehovah wor- \nshipped by the Roman church was a demonic demiurge who created \nthe world of matter to entrap souls in wickedness. Pope Alexander III \nanathematized the Catharan communities and sent ecclesiastical \njudges to investigate their offenses in 1 163. Of these judges, the word \n"inquisitor" was used for the first time. 10 \n\nIn 1209 Pope Innocent II preached a great crusade against the \nFrench rebels. This has gone down in history as the Albigensian \ncrusade, one of the bloodiest chapters in Christianity\'s past. 11 Half of \nFrance was exterminated. When the papal legate was asked how \nheretics were to be distinguished from the faithful, he replied, "Kill \nthem all; God will know his own." 12 \n\nSoon the legate was able to report that in Beziers alone, "nearly \ntwenty thousand human beings perished by the sword. And after the \nmassacre the town was plundered and burnt, and the revenge of God \nseemed to rage over it in a wonderful manner." The killing of \nheretics went on continually for twenty years, and it has been estimated \nthat more than a million were slaughtered. 13 \n\n194 \n\n\n\nThis was more than a police action against heresy. It was the Cu Chulainn \ndestruction of a whole civilization that had the misfortune to be more \nadvanced than the rest of Europe. \n\nIn the twelfth century, the south of France had been the most civilized \nland in Europe. There commerce, industry, art, science, had been far \nin advance of the age. The cities had won virtual self-government, were \nproud of their wealth and strength, jealous of their liberties, and self- \nsacrificing in their patriotism. The nobles, for the most part, were \ncultivated men, poets themselves or patrons of poetry, who had learned \nthat their prosperity depended on the prosperity of their subjects, and that \nmunicipal liberties were a safeguard rather than a menace to the wise \nruler. The Crusaders came, and their unfinished work was taken up and \nexecuted to the bitter end by the Inquisition. It left a ruined and \nimpoverished country, with shattered industries and a failing commerce. \nThe native nobles were broken by confiscation and replaced by \nstrangers A people of rare gifts had been tortured, decimated, humili- \nated, despoiled. . . . The precocious civilization which had promised to \nlead Europe in the path of culture was gone, and to Italy was transmitted \nthe honour of the Renaissance. H \n\nCatholic writers made many efforts to justify the destruction. \n\nApologists like Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay used vituperation, calling the \n\nCatharan opinions "this detestable pest ... the poison of superstitious \n\ninfidelity." He said Toulouse was "marvelously and miserably infected \n\nwith this plague . . . almost all the barons of Provence had become \n\nharborers and defenders of heretics." In the 19th century, Abbe \n\nVacandard said, "The Church, after all, was only defending herself. \n\nThe Cathari sought to wound her mortally by attacking her doctrine, \n\nher hierarchy and her apostolicity. She would have been ruined if \n\ntheir perfidious insinuations, which brought violent disturbance into \n\nmen\'s minds, had prevailed in the end." 15 It has ever been the \n\nchurch\'s habit to regard any skepticism concerning its pronouncements \n\nas "violent disturbance"; but of course, all the bloodletting was in \n\nvain. Skepticism did prevail in the end. \n\n1.0xenstierna,76. 2. H. Smith, 252-53. 3. Reinach, 295. 4. H. Smith, 253. \n\n5. Briffault 3, 392. 6. Reinach, 294. 7. Lea unabridged, 656-60. 8. H.

Their idols were \n\nsometimes interpreted as images of St. Sebastian, now officially \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^_ viewed as an over-hasty canonization of a Gaulish heathen savior. 2 \n\nCu Chulainn received his education in battle skills from Skadi, or \nScatha, the same northern death-goddess as the Queen of Skye. His \ndestiny or "weird" was to kill his rival on the "precursor day of spring," \nso the shedding of blood would "allow spring to enter." 3 The same \nidea of bloodshed to facilitate the return of spring is found in Teutonic \nmyths of Skadi. 4 \n\nCu means "dog," a common title of Celtic chieftains (as in \nCunobelin) identified with the underworld Lord of Death. Like \nEgypt\'s Anubis, the dead hero might become the canine gatekeeper \ncharged with admitting souls to paradise, as shown on the Gundes- \ntrup Cauldron. 5 The dog represented reincarnation. So did Cu \nChulainn, who was promised that "his rebirth would be of himself." \nHe was sent to Emania, the realm of the dead in the moon. 6 He may \nhave been the original of the British legend that the man in the moon \nis really a dog, who acts as a messenger of death. 7 \n\nThe virgin mother of Cu Chulainn conceived him by eating his \nsoul in the form of a fly. This Celtic soul-symbol originated in the \nMiddle East, where the Lord of Death was Baal-Zebub (Beelzebub), \nLord of Flies. Like most pagan gods, Cu Chulainn was a shape- \nshifter. He could be an insect, animal, or man at different stages in his \nlife cycle. Such changes from one shape to another were based on the \nancient Indo-European idea of metempsychosis. The Protean hero \neven adapted his shape to Christianity; the medieval Irish insisted that \nhe was an avatar of Christ. 8 \n\nLater Irish writers pretended that Cu Chulainn was not ignomini- \nously trussed up to his pillar as a sacrifice, in the manner of the old \ngods. They thought it important to prove that he fell in battle. There- \nfore they invented the legend that, wounded and knowing himself \ndoomed, Cu Chulainn tied himself to the sacred pillar so he couldn\'t \nfall down before his enemies, who were piercing him with arrows, but \nrather "died with his honor unimpaired." 9 \n\nl.Rees,235. 2.

A 16th-century writer \ntherefore described the cuckold as "cornute," that is, "as soundly \narmed for the head, as either Capricorn, or the stoutest horned sign in \nthe Zodiac." 3 See Horns. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 80. 2. Frazer, G.B., 142. 3. Hazlitt, 160. \n\n\n\nCunt \n\nDerivative of the Oriental Great Goddess as Cunti, or Kunda, the \nYoni of the Uni-verse. 1 From the same root came county, kin, and kind \n(Old English cyn, Gothic kuni). Related forms were Latin cunnus, \nMiddle English cunte, Old Norse and Frisian kunta, Basque cuna. \nOther cognates are "cunabula," a cradle, or earliest abode; "Cun- \nina," a Roman Goddess who protected children in the cradle; \n"cunctipotent," all-powerful (i.e., having cunt-magic); "cunicle," a \nhole or passage; "cuniculate," penetrated by a passage; "cundy," a \ncoverted culvert; also cunning, kenning, and ken: knowledge, learn- \ning, insight, remembrance, wisdom. Cunt is "not slang, dialect or any \nmarginal form, but a true language word, and of the oldest stock." 2 \n\n"Kin" meant not only matrilineal blood relations, but also a cleft or \ncrevice, the Goddess\'s genital opening. A Saharan tribe called Kun- \ntahs traced their descent from this holy place. 3 Indian "kundas" were \ntheir mothers\' natural children, begotten out of wedlock as gifts of the \nGoddess Kunda. 4 Of old the name applied to girls, as in China where \ngirls were once considered children of their mothers only, having no \nnatural connection with fathers. 5 \n\nIn ancient writings, the word for "cunt" was synonymous with \n"woman," though not in the insulting modern sense. An Egyptolo- \ngist was shocked to find the maxims of Ptah-Hotep "used for \'woman\' a \nterm that was more than blunt," though its indelicacy was not in the \neye of the ancient beholder, only in that of the modern scholar. 6 \n\nMedieval clergymen similarly perceived obscenity in female-geni- \ntal shrines of the pagans: holy caves, wells, groves. Any such place \nwas called cunnus diaboli, "devilish cunt." Witches who worshipped \nthere sometimes assumed the name of the place, like the male witch \nJohannes Cuntius mentioned by Thomas More. 7 "Under painful cir- \ncumstances" this witch died at the hands of witch hunters, but it was \nsaid he was resurrected, and came back to earth as a lecherous incubus. 8 \n\nSacred places identified with the world-cunt sometimes embar- \nrassed Victorian scholars who failed to understand their earlier \n\n\n\n197 \n\n\n\nCupid meaning. A.H. Clough became a laughing-stock among Gaelic-speak- \n\nCurse, Mother\'s ing students when he published a poem called Toper-na-Fuosich, \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m literally "bearded well," a Gaelic place-name for a cunt-shrine. The \nsynonym "twat" was ignorantly used by another Victorian poet, \nRobert Browning, in the closing lines of his Pippa Passes: \n\nThen, owls and bats, \n\nCowls and twats, \n\nMonks and nuns, in a cloisters moods, \n\nAdjourn to the oak-stump pantry! \n\nEditors of the Oxford English Dictionary hesitantly asked \n\nBrowning where he learned the word. He said it came from a bawdy \n\nbroadside poem of 1659: "They talked of his having a Cardinal\'s Hat; \n\nThey\'d send him as soon an Old Nun\'s Twat." Browning thought the \n\nword meant a wimple, or other headgear corresponding to "hat." 9 \n\n1. G.R. Scott, 188. 2. Dames, 110-14. 3. Briffault 1, 604. \n\n4. Mahanirvanatantra, 289. 5.

In the same way, Latin \ncaritas was altered from sensual or sexual giving to the modern \n"charity," giving of money. \n\nRenaissance art made emanations of Cupid into amoretti, "little \nloves," shown as winged babies. But ancient talismans of Cupid were \nnot babies; they were winged phalli of bronze, ivory, or wood, which \ngave rise to an Italian slang term for the penis, uccello, "little bird." \' \n\n1. Young, 74. \n\n\n\nCurse, Mother\'s \n\nIn ancient Asiatic belief, a mother\'s curse meant certain death. All \ndeath was brought about by the Goddess\'s word of destruction, as all \nbirth was brought about by her word of creation. By virtue of \nmotherhood, any woman could tap the verbal power of the Goddess. \nThe Markandaya Purana says, "for all curses there is some remedy; \nbut there is nothing anywhere that can dispel the curse of those who \nhave been cursed by a mother." J Similarly, the biblical Hannah \nrejoiced when she became a mother, saying, "My mouth is enlarged \nover mine enemies" (1 Samuel 2:1) because maternity gave her \ncurses an irresistible power. \n\n\n\n198 \n\n\n\nHomer tells the story of Meleager, cursed by his mother for \nmurdering her brothers. Falling on her knees, she knocked the earth \nwith her fists and called upon the underground Goddess. "And the \nFury that walks in the dark and has inexorable thoughts heard her \nfrom Erebus." 2 The Fury told Meleager\'s mother to burn his soul in \nthe form of a wand, so he was stricken with a fever, and soon died. 3 \n\nWitchcraft of this sort was not even necessary the curse alone \ncould kill. The Greek word for the effect of a mother\'s curse was \nmiasma, a kind of spiritual pollution bringing slow but sure destruction. \nMiasma could pursue members of a clan for many generations. The \ntragic family history of Orestes might be traced to a curse laid by the \nGoddess Artemis herself on his ancestor Atreus, who dared to \nwithhold the golden fleece of a sacrificial lamb she had sent, using it to \nconfirm his right to rule. 4 \n\nGods launched curses too, and some of them were spectacular, like \nthose with which Yahweh threatened all who disobeyed him: a \ncombination of pestilence, fever, consumption, inflammation, blasting, \nmildew, extreme burning, emerods (hemorrhoids), the scab, the itch, \nthe botch of Egypt, madness, blindness, slavery, great plagues of long \ncontinuance, and barrenness of the land (Deuteronomy 28). How- \never, the gods\' curses seemed not to arouse as much terror as those of \nGoddess or Mother. \n\nThe terrible vehicle of the feminine curse was menstrual blood, \nstill called The Curse. To "damn" has been linked with the Hebrew \ndam, "blood," specifically mother-blood, the fluid of the womb, an- \nciently thought to create one\'s very soul and destroy it. Dam was \nalso synonymous with "mother" (ma-dam, my mother). Elder women \npast menopause were thought to be the most efficient cursers, on the \nancient theory that their "wise blood" was retained in their bodies, \ngiving them numinous power to make their words come true. 5 This \nwas why medieval Europe believed any destructive charm having \nmenstrual blood as one of its ingredients must be irresistible, and why \nelder women were viewed as prototypical witches, their words or even \ntheir glances heavy with dread. \n\nFathers of the church even wooed converts with the assurance that \nthe Christian faith was strong enough to overcome a mother\'s curse, \nthe most powerful curse known to man. St. Augustine claimed that \nsome children cursed by their mother were afflicted by constant \nweakness and tremors, but St. Stephen converted them to Christianity, \nand they were completely cured of the effects of the curse. 6 \n\nEastern sages believed the feminine power of the curse must be \nallayed not so much by opposing it with a patriarchal religion, as by \ntreating women well, so they would not be inclined to use their \ndestructive power. The Laws of Manu said: \n\nWomen must be honored and adorned by their fathers, brothers, hus- \nbands, and brothers-in-law, who desire their own welfare. Where \nwomen are honored, there the gods are pleased, but where they are not \n\n\n\nCurse, Mother\'s \n\n\n\nLaws of Manu \n\nPost-Vedic treatise on \nholy law, composed or \ncollected some time \nbetween the 2nd \ncentury B.C. and the \n2nd century a.d. \n\n\n\n199 \n\n\n\nCut hbert , Saint honored, no sacred rite yields rewards. Where the female relations live \n\nin grief, the family soon wholly perishes; but that family where they are \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not unhappy ever prospers. The houses on which female relations, not \n\nbeing duly honored, pronounce a curse, perish completely, as if destroyed \nby magic. 7 \n\nThis advice came from the place northern Aryans called Mut- \nspellheim, the Home of the Mother\'s Curse, in "the hot lands of the \nsouth." According to the Scandinavian prophecy of doomsday, the \nMutspell would fall upon the violent patriarchal gods who ignored \nancient tribal bonds and rules of morality, and instituted cruel \nwarfare. The result of the Mother\'s Curse would be the death of all \ngods, their Gotterdammerung or Going-Into-the-Shadow; thus it \nseemed the Mother\'s word of destruction meant the end of the world. 8 \n\nChristian Gnostic writings reveal the same belief in a world- \ndestroying curse from a Great Mother disgusted with the cruel \nbehavior of the gods she created. In her anger, the Goddess would send \na great power from the place "where the firmament of woman is \nsituated," the Gnostic equivalent of Mutspellheim. "Then she will drive \nout the gods of Chaos whom she had created together with the first \nFather. She will cast them down to the abyss. They will be wiped out by \ntheir own injustice." 9 \n\nMyths in general suggest that a mother\'s curse was the necessary \ninstrument of destruction for any god, even a Savior-son, most of \nwhom were solemnly cursed before immolation. 10 Since a mother\'s \ncurse was immutable, no guilt accrued to the executioners who \ncarried out sacrificial killings in ancient dramas of death and resurrec- \ntion. Mythology bears out the archetypal idea that one who gives \nbirth has unlimited power over the life so given, and may retain control \nof that life\'s duration. \n\nAs a rule therefore, death curses usually employed female symbol- \nism. Typical was the curse of the "black fast," utilizing a black hen, \nonce sacred to the Queen of the Shades as destructive twin of the \nMother of the World Egg. The curse was accomplished by the \noperator and the black hen fasting together, every Friday for nine weeks \n(the Goddess\'s day and number). After this, an accursed one was sure \nto die. 11 \n\n1. O\'Flaherty, 68. 2. Cavendish, P.E., 122. 3. Graves, CM. 1, 266. \n\n4. Graves, CM. 2, 44. 5. Gifford, 26. 6. de Voragine, 57. 7.

He was periodically displayed, and always \npronounced remarkably fresh. His remains were last viewed in 1827 \nand found to be as plump and rosy as ever almost as if he were a \nwaxwork, if it were possible to suspect the church of perpetrating \nsuch a hoax. \n\nOddly enough, while his incorruptible body lay in Durham Cathe- \ndral, St. Cuthbert also lived on at the bottom of the sea, as a marine \nsmith-god who forged beads for rosaries in his ocean cave. Crinoid shells \nwashed up on Northumbrian beaches after storms were known as St. \nCuthbert\'s Beads. 1 \n\nThere was also a St. Cuthbert\'s Well, located near the famous \nEden Hall, whose "luck" talisman was a sacred chalice inherited from \nthe fairies. 2 The waters of St. Cuthbert\'s Well were credited with the \nusual miraculous powers of healing and preserving health. \n\n1.

Her triumphal procession \nwas "later glorified by marvelous legends, and the poets told of \nedifying miracles that had occurred during Cybele\'s voyage." l \n\nHer holy aniconic image was carried to Rome by order of the \nCumaean Sybil, a personification of the same cave-dwelling Goddess \nherself. As the Great Mother of all Asia Minor, she was worshipped \nespecially on Mt. Ida, Mt. Sipylus, Cyzicus, Sardis, and Pessinus in \nGalatia. 2 \n\nHer festivals were called ludi, "games." 3 A highlight of her \nworship was the Taurobolium, baptism in the blood of a sacred bull, \nwho represented her dying-god consort, Attis. Her temple stood on the \nVatican, where St. Peter\'s basilica stands today, up to the 4th century \na.d. when Christians took it over. 4 She was one of the leading deities of \nRome in the heyday of the mystery cults, along with Hecate and \nDemeter of Eleusis. 5 \n\nOther names for Cybele assimilated her to every significant form \nof the Great Goddess. She was the Berecynthian Mother (genetrix \nBerecynthia). She was Rhea Lobrine, Goddess of sacred caves, known \nas her "marriage bowers." 7 She was called Augusta, the Great One; \nAlma, the Nourishing One; Sanctissima, the Most Holy One. Roman \nemperors like Augustus, Claudius, and Antoninus Pius regarded her \nas the supreme deity of the empire. Augustus established his home \nfacing her temple, and looked upon his wife, the empress Livia \nAugusta, as an earthly incarnation of her. 8 The emperor Julian wrote an \nimpassioned address to her: \n\nWho is then the Mother of the Gods? She is the source of the intellectual \nand creative gods, who in their turn guide the visible gods; she is both \n\n\n\nVariations of \nCybele\'s name \nKubaba, Kuba, \nKube have been \nlinked with the \nKa\'aba stone at Mecca, \na meteoric "cube" \nthat bore the Goddess\'s \nsymbol and was once \nknown as the Old \nWoman. 6 \n\n\n\n201 \n\n\n\nCyboread the mother and the spouse of mighty Zeus; she came into being next to \n\nCynosure and together with the great creator; she is in control of every form of \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ life, and the cause of all generation; she easily brings to perfection all \n\nthings that are; she is the motherless maiden, enthroned at the side of \nZeus, and in very truth is the Mother of all the Gods. 9 \n\nFathers of the Christian church vehemently disagreed. St. Augus- \ntine called Cybele a harlot mother, "the mother, not of the gods, but \nof the demons." 10 \n\nOne of her names, Antaea, made her the mythical mother of the \nearth-giant Antaeus, who was invincible as long as his feet remained \nin contact with his Mother\'s body, the earth. Heracles conquered him \nby holding him up in the air. Churchmen believed the powers of \nwitches came from the same sort of contact with Mother Earth. \nArresting officers often carried witches to prison in a large basket, so \ntheir feet would not touch the ground. 11 \n\nThere was a Christian sect founded in the 2nd century a.d. by \nMontanus (Mountain man), a priest of Cybele, who identified Attis \nwith Christ. Montanus maintained that women were agents of the \nGoddess, and could preach and prophesy as well as men. This \ncontradicted the orthodox Pauline sect, which followed St. Paul\'s rule \nthat women must never speak publicly on holy subjects. 12 During the \n4th century, Montanist Christianity was declared a heresy, and many of \nits adherents were slain. Some Montanists in Asia Minor were locked \nin their churches and burned alive. 13 \n\n1. Cumont, O.R.R.P., 47 2. Encyc. Brit., "Great Mother of the Gods." \n\n3. James, 246. 4.

Danu, Danuna, Dana \n\nDanae \n\n\n\nEponymous Great Mother of the Danes and many other peoples, \nsuch as the Danaans, the Danaids, the biblical Danites, and the Irish \nTuatha De Danann, "people of the Goddess Dana." l The Russians \n\n\n\ncalled her Dennitsa, "Greatest of all Goddesses." A medieval Russian \nexorcism said: "In the morning let us rise and pray to God and \nDennitsa." 4 \n\nAs Danu-Ana, or Anu, she led the Irish trinity of Fates, collective- \nthe Morrigan. Mountains in Kerry are still named after her breasts, \nthe Paps of Anu. 5 Under the name of Don she was masculinized as a \n"king" of Dublin in late Irish legend; but the same "king" was also \ncalled Mother of the Gods. 6 Sometimes the Irish called her Domnu, a \nmother Goddess personifying the Deep. 7 \n\nClassical Greek mythology humanized the Goddess Danae, in \nmuch the same way as the Bible humanized Earth Mother Eve; the \ntwo were the same deity, fructified by the Heaven-father\'s seminal rain. \nThe Hellenic Danae was a virgin princess impregnated by Zeus\'s \nshower of golden rain that is, urine, to which primitives sometimes \nattributed the same reproductive power as semen. As result of this \nbeneficial moistening, Danae bore the hero Perseus, who annoyed \nfathers of the Christian church by being as verifiably god-begotten \nand virgin-born and their own savior. 9 But Danae, like Eve, was really \nanother name for the universal Triple Goddess, also called Dam-kina \nby the Sumerians, Dinah by the Hebrews, and Danu or Dunnu in \nBabylon. The Greeks knew of three Danaids, known as Telchines or \n"Enchanters," who founded the three chief cities of Rhodes. 10 \n\nWriters of the Old Testament disliked the Danites, whom they \ncalled serpents (Genesis 49:17). Nevertheless, they adopted Dan-El \nor Daniel, a Phoenician god of divination, and transformed him into a \nHebrew prophet. His magic powers like those of the Danites emanat- \ned from the Goddess Dana and her sacred serpents. He served as court \nastrologer and dream-interpreter for both the Persian king Cyrus, and \nthe Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 1:21, 2:1), indicating \nthat "Daniel" was not a personal name but a title, like the Celtic one: \n"a person of the Goddess Dana." \n\n1.

To the \nHindus she was \n"Waters of Heaven," \nmother of the Vedic \ngods. 3 \n\nIn Saxon myth, \nDanu-Ana became \nBlack Annis, or \nAnna of the Angles, or \nthe Blue Hag, or \nAngurboda, mother of \nHel. An ancient \ncave-shrine at Dane\'s \nHill in Leicestershire \nwas her dwelling place, \nknown as Black \nAnnis\'s Bower. 8 \n\n\n\nDaphne \n\n"Laurel," the plant of prophecy chewed by the Goddess\'s priestesses \nin the vale of Tempe, until Apollo\'s cult replaced hers, and restricted \nlaurel-chewing to the Delphic Pythoness. 1 The Goddess\'s original \nname was Daphoene, "Bloody One," in early times when her Maenads \nwere still performing blood sacrifices. \n\nOrgiastic Daphne entered classical mythology as a purified virgin \nwho was saved from rape by Apollo through a transformation into a \nlaurel tree in the nick of time. The myth seems to have been suggested \nby an icon showing the Goddess\'s face looking down from the \nbranches of a laurel tree upon the sacred king immolated at her feet. \n\n\n\n207 \n\n\n\nDark Age Laurel remained the plant of inspiration and poetic frenzy. Laurel \n\ncrowns were given to the best poets, who were then called "laureate"- \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ laurel-crowned. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,81. \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\nWestern histories have put forth many theories about the fall of \nRome and attributed the onset of the Dark Age to a wide variety of \ncauses, except the one cause that may have had more to do with it \nthan any other: Christianity. 1 By denying women\'s spiritual significance \nand forbidding Goddess worship, the church alienated both sexes \nfrom their pagan sense of unity with the divine through each other. \n\nChristians said one of the diabolic symptoms of the oncoming end \nof the world was "the spread of knowledge," which they endeavored \nto check with wholesale book-burnings, destruction of libraries and \nschools, and opposition to education for laymen. 2 By the end of the \n5th century, Christian rulers forcibly abolished the study of philosophy, \nmathematics, medicine, and geography. Lactantius said no Christian \nshould study astronomy. Pope Gregory the Great denounced all secular \neducation as folly and wickedness, and forbade Christian laymen to \nread even the Bible. He burned the library of the Palatine Apollo, "lest \nits secular literature distract the faithful from the contemplation of \nheaven." 3 \n\nIn the church\'s view, every opinion except its own was heretical \nand devilish, likely to raise doubts in the minds of believers. There- \nfore, pagan intellectuals and teachers were persecuted and schools were \nclosed. Christian emperors commanded the burning of all books of \nthe philosophers, as Theodosius said, "for we would not suffer any of \nthose things so much as to come to men\'s ears, which would tend to \nprovoke God to wrath and offend the minds of the pious." After years of \nvandalism and destruction, St. John Chrysostom proudly boasted, \n"Every trace of the old philosophy and literature of the ancient world \nhas vanished from the face of the earth." 4 \n\nIt was almost true. Christian persecutions left "but few fragments \nof a vast liturgy and religious literature of paganism which would have \ncast many a ray of light on the origins of our own faith; and demolished \nholy places and beautiful temples such as the world shall never rear \nagain." 5 After temples were destroyed, monks and hermits were settled \nin the ruins to defile the site with their excrement, and to prevent \nreconstruction. 6 \n\nRulers melted down bronze, gold, and silver artworks for money. \nPeasants broke up marble gods and goddesses and fed their pieces \ninto limekilns for mortar. 7 It is recorded that 4th-century Rome had 424 \ntemples, 304 shrines, 80 statues of deities in precious metal, 64 \nstatues of ivory, 3,700 statues in bronze, and thousands in marble. By \n\n\n\n208 \n\n\n\nthe next century, nearly all of them were gone. The historian \nEunapius, a hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries, watched the \ndestruction and wrote that the empire was being overwhelmed by a \n"fabulous and formless darkness mastering the loveliness of the world." 8 \n\nRoman society was losing its cohesiveness and discipline, with the \nusual symptoms of social decline: runaway inflation, shortages, crime, \napathy, and a discouraged middle class taxed to the breaking point to \nsupport a top-heavy, stagnant bureaucracy. 9 Most Christians came \nnot from that middle class, but from the lower elements of society, \ntaking advantage of lawless times to grab what they could. Celsus said \nthe Christians invited into their ranks "whosoever is a sinner or \nunintelligent, or a fool, in a word, whosoever is god-forsaken, him the \nkingdom of God will receive. Now whom do you mean by the sinner \nbut the wicked: thief, housebreaker, poisoner, temple robber, grave \nrobber?. . . Jesus, they say, was sent to save sinners; was he not sent to \nhelp those who have kept themselves free from sin? They pretend \nthat God will save the unjust man if he repents and humbles himself. \nThe just man who has held steadily from the cradle in the ways of \nvirtue he will not look upon." 10 \n\nBertrand Russell described the philosophical outlook of St. Jerome: \n"He thinks the preservation of virginity more important than victory \nover the Huns and Vandals and Goths. Never once do his thoughts turn \nto any possible measure of practical statesmanship; never once does \nhe point out the evils of the fiscal system, or of reliance on an army \ncomposed of barbarians. The same is true of Ambrose and Augus- \ntine. ... It is no wonder that the Empire fell into ruin." n \n\nConventional histories presented a picture of early Christians as \npeaceable souls, unjustly persecuted. This picture could only have \narisen because historical writing was monopolized by the church for \nmany centuries, and there was no compunction about changing or \nfalsifying records. Pagan Rome didn\'t persecute religious minorities. \n"It never disputed the existence or reality of other deities, and the \naddition of a new member to the Pantheon was a matter of indiffer- \nence. . . . [A]U deities of all peoples were regarded as but manifestations \nof the one supreme deity." Dionysus, Venus, and Priapus were \nhonored co-residents of the temple of Isis in Pompeii. Italian and Greek \ndeities mixed together in the temple of Mithra at Ostia. 12 All deities \nwere willing to co-exist except the Christian one. The Christian church \nalone "has always held the toleration of others to be the persecution \nof itself." 1J As early as 382 a.d., the church officially declared that any \nopposition to its own creed in favor of others must be punished by the \ndeath penalty. 14 \n\nContrary to the conventional mythology, Christians were not \nprosecuted under Roman law for being Christians but for committing \ncivil crimes. 15 They caused riots, "often tumultuously interrupted the \npublic worship, and continually railed against the national religion." 16 \nThey seem to have been guilty of vandalism and arson. The Great Fire \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\n\n\n209 \n\n\n\nDaik Age in 64 a.d. was set by Christians who were "anxiously waiting for the \n\nworld to end by fire and who did at times start fires in order to prompt \n^^^^^^^^^^^ God." 17 Crying that the world would end at any moment, Christian \nfanatics sometimes developed the notion that starting the fires of the \nfinal holocaust would redound to their credit in heaven. 18 At least one \nsaint was canonized for no particular reason other than having been an \narsonist: St. Theodore, whose sole claim to fame was burning down \nthe temple of the Mother of the Gods. 19 \n\nThe decline of Roman civilization and the onset of the Dark Age \nwas the period Gilbert Murray characterized as the western world\'s \nfailure of nerve. It marked the transition of the west from a position of \ncultural leadership to one of regressed barbarism, and transformed \nEurope into what is now known as an "undeveloped area." 20 Intellect, \ntaste, and imagination disappeared from art and literature. Rather \nthan broadening the western mind, its church crippled that mind by \nallowing childish superstitions to flourish in an atmosphere of igno- \nrance and unreason. 21 Suppression of the teaching priestess or alma \nmaterled to an eclipse of education in general. \n\nMany scholars fled from Christian persecutions eastward to Iran, \nwhere the Sassanid king helped them found a school of medicine and \nscience. This was the world\'s intellectual capital for two centuries. 22 \nAlready in 529, when Justinian closed the Athenian schools, Helle- \nnistic learning had been dispersed to Sassanian Persia, Gupta India, ant \nCeltic Ireland. 23 \n\nChurch historians have claimed nothing of real value was lost in \nthe destruction of pagan culture. Modern scholars disagree. The \nhavoc that afflicted art, science, literature, philosophy, engineering, \narchitecture, and all other fields of achievement has been likened to \nthe havoc of the Gigantomachia as if the crude giants overthrew the \nintelligent gods. The widespread literacy of the classical period \ndisappeared. Aqueducts, harbors, buildings, even the splendid Roman \nroads fell into ruin. It has been pointed out that centuries of \ndevastating war could hardly have shattered Roman civilization as \neffectively as did its new obsession with an ascetic monotheism. 24 \n\nBooks and artworks were destroyed because they expressed un- \nchristian ideas and images. 25 The study of medicine was forbidden, \non the ground that all diseases were caused by demons and could be \ncured only by exorcism. This theory was still extant in the time of \nPope Alexander III, who forbade monks to study any techniques of \nhealing other than verbal charms. 26 Under the Christian emperors, \neducated citizens were persecuted by the illiterate who claimed their \nbooks were witchcraft texts. Often, "magical" writings were planted \nby Christian magistrates for the sake of the financial rewards they \nreceived when they caught and executed heretics a system the \nInquisition also used to advantage in later centuries. Priestesses were \nespecially persecuted, because they were female, wealthy, and laid \nclaim to spiritual authority. 27 \n\nFathers of the church seemed cynically aware that public igno- \n\n210 \n\n\n\nranee worked in their favor. Gregory of Nazianzus wrote to St. Jerome: \n"A little jargon is all that is necessary to impose upon the people. The \nless they comprehend, the more they admire. Our forefathers and \ndoctors have often said, not what they thought, but what circumstances \nand necessity dictated." 28 \n\nLactantius declared that pagan temples should be torn down \nbecause, in them, "The demons are attempting to destroy the \nkingdom of God, and by means of false miracles and lying oracles are \nassuming the appearance of real gods." 29 It was dangerous to leave \nthe temples intact, even when they were converted into Christian \nchurches. The temple of the Mother of Heaven at Carthage was \nmade over into a church, but in 440 a.d. the bishop discovered that the \nCarthaginians were actually making their devotions to the old God- \ndess, and ordered the entire temple area leveled to the ground. 30 \n\nIgnorance was helpful to the spread of the faith; so ignorance \nwas fostered. Knight says, "Men are superstitious in proportion as they \nare ignorant, and . . . those who know least of the principles of \nreligion are the most earnest and fervent." 31 In keeping western Europe \nas ignorant as possible, however, the church lost much of its history. \nEven contemporary events went inaccurately reported, or altogether \nunnoted. Events of the past were absurdly garbled. All the public \nknew of history was provided by bards, who tried to maintain the druidic \ntradition of rote-learning, with indifferent success. They taught, for \nexample, that Alexander the Great made an expedition to the Garden \nof Eden, where he was instructed by the poet-magician Virgil, by \n"Monsignor St. Paul," and by "Tholomeus" (Ptolemy), king of Egypt. \nThey taught that Julius Caesar was a king of Hungary and Austria, \nand a prince of Constantinople; his mother was the Valkyrie Brunn- \nhilde, a daughter of Judas Maccabeus; he married Morgana, the \nFairy Queen, and became the father of Oberon and St. George. 32 \n\nThe field of natural science was in even worse disorder. Learned \nbooks taught that mice do not reproduce like other mammals but are \ngenerated spontaneously and asexually from "the putrefaction of the \nearth"; that wasps produce themselves out of a dead horse and bees \nout of a dead calf; that a crab deprived of its legs and buried will turn \ninto a scorpion; that some mammals, such as hares, can change from \none sex to the other; that a duck dried into powder and placed in water \nwill generate frogs; that a duck baked and buried will generate toads; \nthat asparagus is produced from buried shavings of ram\'s horn; that \nscorpions can be created from garden basil rubbed between two \nstones; that rain and lightning can be raised by burning a chameleon\'s \nliver on a rooftop; that no fleas can breed where a man scatters dust \ndug up from his right footprint in the place where he heard the first \nspringtime call of a cuckoo. 33 Because the very idea of experimenta- \ntion to test hypotheses had been replaced by credulous reliance on \ntheological authority, even notions that would have been simple to \ntest remained untested. \n\nAs for more complex hypotheses, they were beyond the ken of \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\n\n\n211 \n\n\n\nDavid, Saint theologians. Pagan thinkers long ago understood the shape of the \n\nearth, and even calculated its approximate circumference with only a \n\n^ ^^ m small error. But Lactantius and other learned churchmen called this \n\nfield of endeavor "bad and senseless," and proved by quoting the Bible \nthat the earth was flat. 34 \n\nThe most thoroughly Christianized nations hardly began to recov- \ner from the church\'s eclipse of learning until the present century. In \nSpain for example, the tradition of book-burning became an integral \npart of the auto-da-fe in 1 502. It was against the law for any layman \nto read any book not approved by the bishops. 35 To own vernacular \ncopies of either Testament of the Bible was punishable by burning at \nthe stake. 36 Reading declined to almost nothing. What few grammar \nschools existed were only "superficial preparation for the priesthood." \nStill, many priests were illiterate. General education was attempted only \nafter the revolutions of 1834 and 1855, when the monasteries were \nsuppressed. Yet in 18%, more than two-thirds of the population were \nstill unable to read or write. 37 \n\nSpanish suspicion of books carried over into the New World, and \ndeprived anthropologists and archeologists of literary treasures that \nmight have shed much light on pre-Columbian civilizations. Spanish \nfriars "converted" the Maya of Yucatan in 1 562, by their usual \nforceful methods, such as torture and burning. They fed the fires with \nhundreds of Maya sacred books which, had they survived, would \nhave greatly assisted modern scholars to unravel the mysteries of Mayan \nscript. The friars said the natives were "greatly afflicted" by the loss of \ntheir scriptures; but as far as the friars could see, these books "contained \nnothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the \ndevil, so we burned them all." 58 \n\n1.

Von Hagen, 432. \n\n\n\nDavid, Saint \n\nPatron saint of Wales, actually a pagan god Christianized in the 1 1th \ncentury a.d. He was the Welsh sea god worshipped as Dewi, from the \nAryan devior deva, "deity." Though he was called a 6th-century \nbishop, nothing was written of him until 1090, more than 500 years \nlater. His wholly unreliable biography was composed chiefly to \nsupport the Welsh bishops\' independence at the time. 1 \n\n\n\n212 \n\n\n\nThe city now called St. David\'s used to be Menevia, "Way of the Death \n\nMoon," the same as Danish Manavegr and Irish E-Mania, the lunar \nparadise. 2 ^^^^^^^^^^^_ \n\nSymbol of David-Dewi was the Great Red Serpent, now the red \ndragon, Wales\'s national emblem. Like the phallic god Python or \nOceanus encircling the World Egg, he may have been reddened by his \nunion with the Moon-goddess Mab, who gave sovereignty to all her \nkings by staining them red. 3 \n\nDavid\'s title, the Waterman, was explained by Christian scholars to \nmean he was a teetotaler. 4 Welsh sailors knew better; their traditions \nplaced him in the depths of the sea. They called him Davy Jones, who \nlike the sea god Mananann kept the souls of drowned seamen in his \n"locker." 5 \n\nWaterman was a popular title for several ancient gods of waters \nbesides Dewi: notably Ceadda, a Mercian god of medicinal springs, \nwho was canonized twice (see Chad). \n\nEven in Christian disguise, David retained the sacred skills of a \nbard. It was claimed that his miraculous talent for harping and singing \ncame from his lineal descent from the virgin Mary, of the ancient house \nof King David the Harpist, in the eighteenth generation. Mary was \nalso identified with the Welsh sea-goddess Marian, Dewi\'s bride, \nreceiver of the souls of the dead. Welsh bards called their death songs \nmarwysgafen, the "giving to Mary," sung to send the funeral boat to the \nIsles of the Dead. 6 \n\nSometimes David was confused with Merlin, who allegedly harped \nand sang the stones of Stonehenge into their places. Some legends \nmade David a bishop of Merlin\'s town, Caerleon. 7 Some said David \nwas King Arthur\'s uncle. Like many mythical saints, he was given a \nlong lifetime to demonstrate the health-giving virtues of Christian faith; \nhe lived to the age of 140 years. 8 His mother was the same virgin \ntemple-maiden who gave birth to nearly every ancient god; here she was \nSt. Non (Holy Nun). 9 Two cities claimed his shrine, located not only \nat St. David\'s but also in the city of Chester, which used to be named \nDeva or Dewi. 10 \n\n1.

Cumont, M.M., 57. \n\n\n\nIth \n\nbeen said that Death came into existence only with the rise of \nman\'s consciousness, a roundabout way of saying death is more real for \nhumans than for any other animal, because only humans foresee it. 1 \nReligions owe their existence to the unique ability of the human animal \nto understand that it must die. \n\nAgainst this realization the forces of imagination are mustered to \ndeny it. It\'s hard for any perceiving mind to perceive its own \n\n\n\n213 \n\n\n\nDeath notbeing, with cessation of all perception. Worshippers of Kali managed \n\nto view the beyond-death state as Dreamless Sleep. 2 But most ancient \n^^^^^^^^^^^ people couldn\'t formulate an idea of non-perception. \n\nEven when the land of the dead was minimally stimulating, as in \nthe Babylonian concept, it was perceptible to the senses. It was the \nHouse of Dust, and the end of the Road of No Return. The dead \nwere clothed in feathers, like birds. "Dust is their food and clay their \nmeat . . . , they see no light, they sit in darkness." Yet in the same \nHouse of Dust there were priests and kings ruling, and servants to carry \nthe baked meats and pour water from water skins. 3 \n\nBabylonian literature reveals a hope that eventually the right ritual \ncure for death will be discovered, rather as modern people hope for a \ncure for cancer. The recommended avenue of investigation was necro- \nmantic consultation with the dead themselves. "The quest for \nimmortality was essentially the search for the right ritual, the knowledge \nof what to do in order to secure a continued existence of the body \nafter death. This knowledge is possessed by the ancestors, and can only \nbe obtained from them." 4 \n\nMen have usually believed that knowledge of death can only come \nfrom those who have experienced it. Hence the initiatory procedures \ninvolving mock death, as among Siberian shamans, who experience in \ntrances being torn apart and reduced to bare bones. "By thus seeing \nhimself naked, altogether freed from the perishable and transient flesh \nand blood, he consecrates himself, in the sacred tongue of the \nshamans, to his great task, through that part of his body which will \nlongest withstand the action of the sun, wind and weather, after he is \ndead. . . . [I]n certain Central Asian meditations that are Buddhistic and \ntantric in origin or at least in structure, reduction to the skeleton \ncondition has . . . an ascetic and metaphysical value anticipating the \nwork of time, reducing life by thought to what it really is, an \nephemeral illusion in perpetual transformation." 5 \n\nSo vivid were the fantasies of the death-world that some Oriental \nsages prayed for sufficient conscious sense to realize that they were \nnothing more than inventions of the mind: "May I recognize whatever \nvisions appear, as the reflections of my own consciousness. May I \nknow them to be of the nature of apparitions in the intermediate State. \nMay I not fear the troops of my own thought forms, the Peaceful \n\nDeities and the Wrathful May it come that all the Sounds will be \n\nknown as one\'s own sounds; may it come that all the Radiances will . 1 \nbe known as one\'s own radiances." 6 \n\nTantric Buddhism proposed that the death world or Intermediate \nState could be controlled if one were prepared through carefully \nguided fantasy in life to retain memory, consciousness, and the goal of \nchoosing for one\'s self the right "womb-door" for a better reincarna- \ntion. 7 Living and dying were only complementary aspects of the same \ncycle, both requiring proper education. "Material life moves between \ntwo poles," Bachofen says. "Its realm is not that of being but that of \n\n\n\n214 \n\n\n\nbecoming and passing away, the eternal alternation of two colors, the \nLvhite of life and the black of death. Only through the equal mixture of \n!he two is the survival of the material world assured. Without death \nho rejuvenation is possible ... the positive power cannot for one mo- \nhtient exist without the negative power. Death, then, is not the \nbpposite but the helper of life." 8 \n\nThe Great Goddess was intimately involved in every manifestation \npf death as she was in those of life, which is why she had an \n[\'emanation" for each fatal disease, such as Mari-Amma, Ankamma, \nMutteyalamma, etc. Her priestesses supported and taught the dying. \n\'As among the gods, so among the mortals was death everywhere \nvoman\'s business. A woman is said to have invented the wailing for \nhe dead. . . . Women cradle the infant and the corpse, each to its \n^articular new life." 9 \n\nRomans thought death should be kept in mind at all times, \nspecially when life at its peak might make one forget the other, \nqually necessary part of the cycle. When a military hero entered Rome \nn triumphal procession, riding in a golden chariot, hailed as a god in \nhe ancient equivalent of a ticker-tape parade, a person wearing the \nnask and costume of Death stood at his shoulder, preserving him \nrom the sin of hubris by saying each moment in his ear, "Man, \nemember you will die." 10 \n\nPaganism fostered the Tantric idea of growth and decline in \necurrent cycles. "The old fertility gods did not shrink from the fact \n>f death; they sought no infantile evasion, but promised rebirth and \nenewal." u Christianity on the other hand denied that members of \nts sect could die. Early Christians who died were said to have "fallen \nsleep," soon to wake up again with the second coming of Christ. A \nnorbid anxiety often accompanied ritual denial. Kermode says, "Chris- \nianity of all the great religions is the most anxious, is the one which \naid the most emphasis on the terror of death." 12 \n\nSometimes fear became obsession, in a love-hate relationship with \neath. In the Secret Book of James, Jesus recommended suicide, \nmarking that the kingdom of death could only belong to those who \n>ut themselves to death, and no one who avoided this duty could be \naved. 13 \n\nObsession flowered into a thousand elaborate death customs and \nituals aimed at encapsulating the phenomenon, separating it from \nrdinary life experience so its inevitability need not be fully understood, \nn Frazer\'s opinion such customs and rituals have been the most \nwasteful ever seen in any society: \n\nNo belief has done so much to retard the economic and thereby the social \nprogress of mankind as has the belief in the immortality of the soul; for \nthis belief has led race after race, generation after generation, to sacrifice \nthe real wants of the living to the imaginary wants of the dead. The \nwaste and destruction of life and property which this faith has entailed are \nenormous and incalculable. \' 4 \n\n\n\nDeath \n\n\n\nSecret Book of \nJames One of the so- \ncalled Gnostic \nGospels discovered at \nNag Hammadi in \nUpper Egypt, 1945, \npurporting to have \nbeen written by the \napostle James. \n\n\n\n215 \n\n\n\nDeath Pagan philosophers\' acceptance of death may have been more \n\npractical than the elaborate denials that arose later. With a somber but \n\n^________ _ courageous serenity, Euripides stated the pagan idea that opinions on \n\ndeath are not possible: \n\nBut if any far-off state there be \n\nDearer to life than mortality \n\nThe hand of the Dark hath hold thereof, \n\nAnd mist is under the mist above; \n\nSo we are sick for life, and cling \n\nOn earth to this nameless and shining thing, \n\nFor other life is a fountain sealed, \n\nAnd the deeps below are unrevealed, \n\nAnd we drift on legends for ever. IS \n\nBecause they were westerners, the Greek philosophers have \nbeen given more credit for originality than they deserved. Actually, their \nopinions of death and its implications for the living were largely taken \nfrom Oriental sages who evolved them first. Greek notions of the \nDreamless Sleep, of reincarnation, of the four ages of man including \nthe primordial Age of Giants, all were derived from Oriental sources. \nTantric sages spoke of the faraway Golden Age when all men were \ngiants and lived lifetimes of about a thousand years each, because they \nwere nearer in time to the world\'s creation, when the Goddess\'s \nnourishing birth blood was more abundant and the knowledge of her \nwas more intimate among her children. As the Bible said, there were \ngiants in the earth in those days (Genesis 6:4). 16 \n\nThe same long-lived giants were identified with their own ances- \ntors by the authors of Genesis. The Hindu concept of human \nlongevity in the Golden Age was copied into the Bible as a quality of the \nearly patriarchs not quite a thousand years apiece, but at least more \nthan nine centuries. Adam lived to be 930 years old; Seth 912 years; \nEnos 905 years; and so on, the champion being Methusaleh at 969 \nyears (Genesis 5). \n\nHowever long delayed, though, death must come, and that was the \nthought that patriarchal thinkers found unacceptable. The older \nmatriarchal religions were more realistic in their acceptance of death, \nmaking it the sage\'s duty to realize the ugliness, corruption, and \ndecay in nature as fully as he might realize its beauty: to accord death \nthe same value as birth. The two were of equal importance, as two \npassages through the same Door: one coming out, the other going in. \nDifferent forms of the Goddess represented the idea. On the one \nhand she was the beautiful nubile Virgin or the tender nurturing \nMother; on the other hand she was a hideous ghoul, herself corpse- \nlike and a devourer of corpses and these two forms of her were to be \nadored equally. Avalon justly remarked that in the west, "the terrible \nbeauty of such forms is not understood"; missionaries could only \ndescribe the Death-goddess as a she-devil. 17 Yet, for the enlightened, \n\n\n\n216 \n\n\n\n"This fanged and bloody Goddess is the same as the other, the beautiful Deborah \n\n) mother and lover. To be able to superimpose and adore both images Delilah \n\n! in one is perhaps the solidest beginning on the road of sadhana." 18 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSome individuals in western culture arrived more or less indepen- \njdently at the vision of this archetypal female death spirit. Wherever \nthere was a concept of Mother Nature, it could hardly fail to be noticed \nthat it was natural to die, and the roots of every flower lay in organic \nrot. Coleridge spoke of the "Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH" as a \n(woman. Keats described himself as "half in love with easeful Death." \niLike the Oriental sages, Alfred de Vigny perceived Death as a maternal \n[Goddess: "O Death divine, at whose recall / Returneth all / To fade \nin thy embrace, / Gather thy children to thy bosom starred, / Free us \nfrom time, from number, and from space, / And give us back the rest \nthat life hath marred." 19 \n\nI. von Franz, pi. 7. 2.

Deborah lived under a sacred \nDalm tree that also bore her name, and was identified with the maternal \nTree of Life, like Xikum, the Tree of Ishtar. The Bible called her a \n\'prophetess" or "judge" to disguise the fact that she was one of the \ngoverning matriarchs of a former age (Judges 4:4). \n\nOne of Deborah\'s alternate names was Jael, "the Goddess Jah," \nwssibly the same one patriarchal Persians called Jahi the Whore, an \narlier feminine form of Yahweh. 2 \n\n1. Sobol, 138; Neumann, CM., 267. 2. Albright, 23. \n\n\n\nDelilah \n\n\'She Who Makes Weak," a name compounded of De (daleth), the \n\'onic Door, and lilu, the lotus, another yonic symbol. She was the \nGoddess who "weakened" the sun god every day and sent him to his \nleath on the wheel that turned him under the earth. In the case of \n>amson who was the sun god Shams-On, or Shamash it was the \nnill wheel. In the case of Heracles, another name for the same solar \nleity, it was Omphale\'s wheel: the omphalos often represented by the \nosmic yoni. \n\n\n\n217 \n\n\n\nDelphi Delphi \n\nDemeter \n\n\n\n"Womb"; Greece\'s oldest, most famous oracle, where Mother Earth \nwas worshipped under the name of Delphyne, the Womb of Creation, \nalong with her serpent-son and consort Python. 1 At various times the \noracle was said to belong to the Sea-goddess, or the Moon-goddess, \nvarious designations of the same primal Mother, whose priestess- \ndaughters, the Pythonesses, controlled the rites. Eventually the \npatriarchal god Apollo took it over, retaining the Pythonesses, but \nclaiming to have placed the Serpent in his underground uterine cave, \nwhence came the oracle\'s inspiration. Apollo murdered the priestess \nDelphyne, and held the oracle until it was closed by the Christian \nemperor Theodosius. After him, Arcadius had the temple entirely \ndestroyed. \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,80. \n\n\n\nDemeter \n\nGreek meter is "mother." De is the delta, or triangle, a female- \ngenital sign known as "the letter of the vulva" in the Greek sacred \nalphabet, as in India it was the Yoni Yantra, or yantra of the vulva. 1 \nCorresponding letters Sanskrit dwr, Celtic duir, Hebrew daleth \nmeant the Door of birth, death, or the sexual paradise. 2 Thus, \nDemeter was what Asia called "the Doorway of the Mysterious Femi- \nnine ... the root from which Heaven and Earth sprang." ? In \nMycenae, one of Demeter\'s earliest cult centers, tholos tombs with their \ntriangular doorways, short vaginal passages and round domes, repre- \nsented the womb of the Goddess from which rebirth might come. \nDoorways generally were sacred to women. In Sumeria they were \npainted red, representing the female "blood of life." 4 In Egypt, door- \nways were smeared with real blood for religious ceremonies, a custom \ncopied by the Jews for their Passover rites. \n\nThe triangle-door-yoni symbolized Demeter\'s trinity. Like all the \noldest forms of the basic Asiatic Goddess she appeared as Virgin, \nMother, and Crone, or Creator, Preserver, Destroyer, like Kali-Cunti \nwho was the same yoni-mother. Demeter\'s Virgin form was Kore, \nthe Maiden, sometimes called her "daughter," as in the classical myth \nof the abduction of Kore, which divided the two aspects of the \nGoddess into two separate individuals. Demeter\'s Mother form had \nmany names and titles, such as Despoena, "the Mistress"; Daeira, \n"the Goddess"; the Barley-Mother; the Wise One of Earth and Sea; or \nPluto, "Abundance." This last name was transferred to the male \nunderworld god said to have taken the Maiden into the earth-womb \nduring the dark season when fields lay fallow. But this was a late, \nartificial myth. The original Pluto was female, and her "riches" were \npoured out on the world from her breasts. 5 \n\nThe Crone phase of Demeter, Persephone-the-Destroyer, was \n\n\n\n218 \n\n\n\nidentified with the Virgin in late myth, so the Maiden abducted into \nthe underworld was sometimes Kore, sometimes Persephone. Some of \nthe Destroyer\'s other, earlier names were Melaina, the Black One; \nDemeter Chthonia, the Subterranean One; or The Avenger (Erinys). \nHer black-robed, mare-headed idol, her mane entwined with Gorgon \nsnakes, appeared in one of her oldest cave-shrines, Mavrospelya, the \nBlack Cave, in Phigalia (southwest Arcadia). She carried a dolphin \nI and a dove, symbols of womb and yoni. Like the devouring death- \ngoddess everywhere, she was once a cannibal. She ate the flesh of \nPelops, then restored him to life in her cauldron. 6 She was as fearsome \nas every other version of the Crone. The legendary medieval Night- \nMare an equine Fury who tormented sinners in their sleep was \nbased on ancient images of Mare-headed Demeter. \n\nHer cult was already well established at Mycenae in the 1 3th \ncentury B.C. and continued throughout Greece well into the Chris- \ntian era, a length of time almost equal to the lifespan of Christianity \nitself. 7 Her temple at Eleusis, one of the greatest shrines in Greece, \nbecame the center of an elaborate mystery-religion. Sophocles wrote, \n"Thrice happy they of men who looked upon these rites ere they go \nto Hades\'s house; for they alone there have true life." Aristides said, \n"The benefit of the festival is not merely the cheerfulness of the \nmoment and the freedom and respite from all previous troubles, but also \nthe possession of happier hopes concerning the end, hopes that our \nlife hereafter will be the better, and that we shall not lie in darkness and \nfilth the fate that is believed to await the uninitiated." Isocrates said: \n"Demeter . . . being graciously minded towards our forefathers because \nof their services to her, services of which none but the initiated may \nhear, gave us the greatest of all gifts, first, those fruits of the earth which \nsaved us from living the life of beasts, and secondly, that rite which \nmakes happier the hopes of those that participate therein concerning \nboth the end of life and their whole existence." 8 \n\nEleusis meant "advent." Its principal rites brought about the \nadvent of the Divine Child or Savior, variously named Brimus, \nDionysus, Triptolemus, Iasion, or Eleuthereos, the Liberator. Like the \ncorn, he was born of Demeter-the-earth and laid in a manger or \nwinnowing basket. 9 His flesh was eaten by communicants in the form of \nbread, made from the first or last sheaves. His blood was drunk in the \nform of wine. Like Jesus, he entered the Earth and rose again. \nCommunicants were supposed to partake of his immortality, and \nafter death they were known as Demetreioi, blessed ones belonging to \nDemeter. 10 \n\nRevelations were imparted to the initiate through secret "things \nheard, things tasted, and things seen." " This formula immediately \ncalls to mind the three admonitory monkeys covering ears, mouth, and \neyes, supposed to illustrate the maxim, "Hear no evil, speak no evil, \nsee no evil." Was the "evil" a secret descended from Eleusinian \nreligion? Demeter was worshipped as "the Goddess" by Greek \n\n\n\nDemeter \n\n\n\n219 \n\n\n\nDemetra, Saint peasants all the way through the Middle Ages, even up to the 19th \n\ncentury at Eleusis where she was entitled "Mistress of Earth and \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Sea." In 1801 two Englishmen named Clarke and Cripps caused a riot \namong the peasants by taking the Goddess\'s image away to a \nmuseum in Cambridge. 12 \n\nEarly Christians were much opposed to the Eleusinian rites \nbecause of their overt sexuality, even though their goal was "regener- \nation and forgiveness of sins." 13 Asterius said, "Is not Eleusis the scene \nof descent into the darkness, and of the solemn acts of intercourse \nbetween the hierophant and the priestess, alone together? Are not the \ntorches extinguished, and does not the large, the numberless assem- \nbly of common people believe that their salvation lies in that which is \nbeing done by the two in the darkness?" H Fanatic monks destroyed \nthe temple of these sexual mysteries in 396 a.d., but the site remained \nholy to the Goddess\'s votaries, and the ceremonies were carried on \nthere and elsewhere. 15 \n\nRustics never ceased believing that Demeter\'s spirit was manifest \nin the final sheaf of the harvest, often called the Demeter, the Corn \nMother, the Old Woman, etc. At harvest festivals it was often dressed in \nwoman\'s clothing and laid in a manger to make the cattle thrive. 16 \nSecret anti-Christian doctrines of medieval Freemasonry also drew \nsome symbolism from the cults of the ancient Mistress of Earth and \nSea, particularly the masonic sacred image of Plenty: "an ear of corn \nnear a fall of water." 17 The ultimate Mystery was revealed at Eleusis \nin "an ear of corn reaped in silence" a sacred fetish that the Jews \ncalled shibboleth. 18 \n\n1.

The saint\'s daughter \n(Kore) was kidnapped by "a wicked Turkish wizard" (Hades) and \nlocked up in a tower. A young hero rescued her, but perished \nmiserably, chopped in pieces by the wizard and hung from the tower\'s \nwalls "between heaven and earth." Guided by a stork (her ancient \ntotemic bird of birth), St. Demetra arrived on the scene, reassembled \n\n\n\n220 \n\n\n\nthe hero, and brought him back to life. Several elements of this story Demon \n\nwere repeated in the Germanic fairy tale of Rapunzel. \n\nA masculinized version of Demeter or perhaps one of her \n\nDemetreioi was accepted into the canon as a "St. Demetrius," of \nno known date, and no real biography. His legend, established in the \nlate Middle Ages, made him a warrior saint like the equally mythical \nSt. George. The basic story was invented to publicize his healing relics \npreserved at Salonika. 2 \n\n1. Lawson, 80-84. 2. Attwater, 102. \n\n\n\nDemon \n\nFrom Greek daimon, a personal familiar spirit or guardian angel, like \nthe Roman genius, roughly synonymous with "soul." The daimon of a \nhero could undergo apotheosis, become a god, and rise to heaven to \ndwell among the stars. \n\nThe medieval concept of the demon evolved from Christians\' \nblanket condemnation of all pagan daimones, though they continued \nto believe implicitly in their existence. 1 Demons were usually consid- \nered messengers and assistants of a single Devil, in the same \nrelationship to him as angels to God. Yet they were also called "devils" \nand their master could be "the Demon." The terms were never \nclearly distinguished. \n\nAnimals and people could be "demons," or could harbor demons \nwithin their bodies or minds. Sometimes, any alien group of people \ncould be called demons. Europeans often visualized demons as black, \nlike Negroes. 2 On the other hand, dark-skinned people like the \nSinghalese maintained that demons were white and hairy.* \n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, all bad weather and natural \ncatastrophes were brought about by demons. He said, "It is a dogma \nof faith that demons can produce wind, storms, and rain of fire from \nheaven." Pope Eugene IV issued a bull against human "agents of \nSatan" who controlled weather-demons. Pope John XXII complained \nof wizards who tried to kill him through the agency of demons they \nsent into mirrors and rings. 4 \n\nThe church had several mutually contradictory theories about the \norigin of demons. One theory said they were the rebellious angels \nwho fell with Lucifer, before the creation of Adam and Eve, so the \nprinciple of evil was ready in the garden of Eden to play the tempter\'s \nrole. A second, incompatible theory said demons were created after \nhuman beings. They were begotten by the angels on the daughters of \nmen (Genesis 6:4). "The majority opinion about the fall of the angels, \nheld by St. Augustine and therefore accepted in the Middle Ages, \nwas that it had occurred before the creation of Adam, but some of the \nold notion that the angels had fallen through lust for the daughters of \nmen persisted to reinforce antifeminine prejudices." 5 \n\n\n\n221 \n\n\n\nDemon Some authorities, familiar with the pagans\' animal masks and \n\nanimal-headed idols, said demons were an animal-like race created \n^^^^^^^^^^^ separately by God, ahd readily incarnate in animal form. Black goats, \nbulls, cats, or dogs could be demons. The Gaelic uile-bheist (Yule- \nbeast, moon-calf) was called a demonic animal. St. Ambrose told of a \ncertain priest who exorcised the frogs in a certain marsh to stop them \nfrom croaking during mass. A thirteenth-century bishop of Lausanne \nexorcised all the eels in Lake Leman. 6 St. Augustine confidently \nasserted that demons help sorcerers to perform their magic, and have \nthe power to assume many animal shapes. 7 \n\nAt Basel in 1474, a rooster committed the unnatural crime of \nlaying an egg. It was decided that the bird possessed a demon, but \nexorcism failed to remove it. So the unfortunate rooster was solemnly \nsentenced to death by church authorities, and burned at the stake. 8 \n\nGreeks still believe in the half-horse demons, kallikantzari, de- \nscended from ancient centaurs and the shape-shifting horse-wizards \nof India, the kinnaras, "canterers" who used to live on the holy \nmoilntain of Mandara. 9 Their descendants perhaps founded the city \nof Kallipolis (Gallipoli). Their chief is still called the Lame Devil, \nrecalling lame Amazonian smith-gods like Hephaestus. Until recently \nit was thought any child born on Christmas Day would become a \nkalhkantzaros. w A cruel custom arose from this belief. Children born \non Christmas Day were carried to the market square, where their feet \nwere thrust into a fire until the toenails were singed. 11 The magical \npurpose of this may have been to destroy the horse-demons\' "hoofs." \n\nRecords of witch trials show that almost any kind of animal could \nbe perceived as a demon. Witches were executed because a neigh- \nbor\'s child was frightened by "the devil in the shape of a dog"; or \nbecause a man saw "a Thing like unto a rat" run out of a woman\'s \nhouse; or because a woman kept "two devils in the form of colts"; or be- \ncause a neighbor saw "the devil in the form of a toad" in a woman\'s \ngarden; or because a traveler saw "a Thing like a black cow" near the \nhouse of the accused; or because children heard a woman "talk to the \ndevil in the form of a frog." One woman was condemned because \nneighbors heard near her house at night a "foul yelling, like a number \nof cats." No one seems to have suggested that the yelling was in fact \ndone by cats, not demons. \n\nUrsula Kemp was hanged in 1 581 on the evidence of her own 8- \nyear-old son, who testified that she kept four demons: two cats, a \ntoad, and a black lamb. 12 Not once in the recorded trials did authorities \nquestion witnesses\' ability to distinguish these demons from ordinary \nanimals. It was taken for granted that anyone, even a small child, could \nrecognize His Satanic Majesty no matter how cleverly he disguised \nhimself as an apparently normal beast. \n\nSeveral popes were believed to have familiar demons of their own, \nparticularly the famous Honorius, long remembered as a magician. \nDuring the controversy between Pope Boniface VIII and Philip IV of \n\n\n\n222 \n\n\n\nFrance, the king held an assembly that formally deposed the pope Demon \n\nand presented evidence to prove that he was a sorcerer with a familiar \n\nspirit. 13 ^^_ ^_^____ \n\nSometimes, in the description of demons, imagination failed and \nhad to fall back on popular make-believe. One poor wretch named \nMargot de la Barre was burned at Paris in 1 391 for calling up a demon \n"in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." Pressed \nto describe the demon under the stimulus of torture she could think \nof nothing better to say than that he had "the shape that demons take \nin Passion plays." 14 \n\nIt was often assumed that demons congregated especially in and \naround churches, for some inexplicable reason. Churches had to be \nexorcised at their dedication. Crosses were painted on the walls "to \nterrify the demons." 1S \n\nHouses were similarly protected by many crosses and crucifixes \nbut, nevertheless, harbored many demons, a belief that betrayed little \ntrust in the alleged powers of the crucifix. The custom of ringing church \nbells at the time of a death was supposed to drive away demons "who \nstood at the bed\'s foot, and about the house, ready to seize their prey, or \nat least to molest and terrify the soul in its passage, but by the ringing \nof that bell (for Durandus informs us evil spirits are much afraid of \nbells), they were kept aloof: and the soul, like a hunted hare, gained \nthe start." Tolling the church\'s largest bell commanded a higher price, \n"for that, being louder, the evil spirits must go farther off, to be clear \nof its sound, by which the poor Soul got so much more the start of \nthem." 16 \n\nBefore the witchcraft mania set in about the 12th and 1 3th \ncenturies, there was a general understanding that demons were \nnothing more than the old gods and goddesses, all of whom had animal \nincarnations of some kind. Christian fathers insisted that the pagan \ndeities were not figments of imagination, but real, living demons. \nLearned men even in the 19th century still believed this. Rawlinson, \nthe translator of Herodotus, was sure the oracle at Delphi was an evil \nspirit. 17 An early medieval baptismal formula demanded renunciation \nof "relations with the demon," defining the old religion as "works of the \ndemon, and all his words, and Thor, and Odin, and Saxnot, and all \nevil beings that are like them." 18 Such formalities were largely ignored. \nCenturies later, holiday dancers included personifications of the \nHorned God and the Scandinavian Julebuk (Yule Buck), which church- \nmen denounced as "the devil himself." 19 Monastic writers of the \n1 1th century spoke of many demons who constantly tempted people \naway from the church, showing them "delights and secrets, such as \nhow they might become immortal." 20 It was clear that they spoke of a \nrival religion. \n\nA Spanish Dominican, Raymond of Tarrega, said demons were \nuseful for punishing sinners in hell; like angels, demons performed \nGod\'s will. It was permissible to adore demons "so long as we adore, not \n\n\n\n223 \n\n\n\nDenis, Saint their evil, but their existence, which was given them by God. It is not \n\nDevi desirable to sacrifice to demons, but to do so is no more serious than \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ adoring an image of Christ or of the saints." 21 Later this opinion was \nrejected, and the Inquisition burned Raymond\'s book. \n\nI.

The teachings of Krishna or Shiva were ad- \ndressed to the Devi as interrogator of the catechism; she was also \naddressed as Dearly Beloved, the Shakti, a convention copied by the \nNew Testament. Krishna\'s virgin mother was her "maiden" form, \nDevaki. The Goddess\'s title as "the Way leading to the Gods" was \nDevayani, the Divine Yoni. As the virgin mother of Mahavira she \nwas Devananda, "Blessed Goddess." \' A Czech name for the Moon- \ngoddess, Devana, came from the same root, as also the Latin Diana, \n\n\n\n224 \n\n\n\ni% \n\n\n\nMinoan Diwija, Serbian Diiwica, and the Roman Diviana all mean- \ning "The Divinity." 2 \n\nI. Larousse, 347. 2. Thorsten, 361. \n\n\n\nDevil \n\n\n\nDevil \n\nThe words "devil" and "divinity" grew from the same root, Indo- \nEuropean devi (Goddess) or deva (God), which became daeva (devil) in \nPersian. 1 Old English divell (devil) can be traced to the Roman \nderivative divus, divi: gods. 2 Thus it seems that, from the beginning, \ngods and devils were often confused with one another. \n\nDivine and devilish were relative terms, as the primary sense of \nHebrew words for "good" and "evil" really meant "beneficial" and \n"hurtful." 3 Gods did "evil" things if angered; devils could do "good" \nthings if they were pleased. One man\'s god was his enemy\'s devil. \nArmenians used to sacrifice one sheep to Christ at Easter time and thirty \nsheep to the devil, on the theory that the devil\'s influence in the here \nand now was greater. 4 \n\nSuch thinking was not unusual. Devils were often credited with \nbeneficent magic. There was a devil who "maketh men witty, turneth \nall metals into the coin of the dominion, turneth water into wine, and \nwine into water, and blood into wine, and wine into blood, and a \nfool into a wise man and he leads 33 legions of demons." Another \ndevil "perfectly teaches the virtues of the stars, he transformeth men, \nhe giveth dignities, prelacies, and confirmations." Another devil "talketh \nof divine virtue, he giveth true answers of things present, past, and to \ncome, and of the divinity, and of the creation, he deceiveth none, nor \nsuffereth any to be tempted; he giveth dignities and prelacies." 5 \n\nEven early Christians admitted that the "devils" worshipped in \npagan temples were known to restore the sick to health. 6 Tertullian \nsaid, Diabolus simia Dei, the Devil imitates God; but in point of \nchronology there was some doubt about who was imitating whom. 7 \n\nJudeo-Christian tradition attributed many "diabolic" acts to God. \nHe was the sender of pestilence and famine. He created a terrible \nhell, and its demons, who tortured human souls on his orders. He \ncaused violent storms, which were (and still are) called "acts of God." \nFrom the 1 5 th century on, the church sold waxen cakes, the Agnus \nDei, stamped with a cross and advertised as sure protection against \nstorms and other "acts of God"; thus God was incongruously invoked to \ncombat himself. 8 \n\nGod even killed himself in the person of Christ, according to the \npieological dogma that they were one and the same. On the other \nBiand, some claimed Christ was killed by "devilish" Jews. Though Jews \n(were carrying out God\'s ordained scheme of salvation, and doing \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens \nTertullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Carthage \nof pagan parents. \n\n\n\n225 \n\n\n\nDevil God\'s will by executing Jesus, nevertheless theology exonerated God \n\nand blamed them. Though the Old Testament God did much "evil," \n^^^^^^^^^^ even destroying many thousands of his own helpless worshippers for \ntrivial offenses (1 Samuel 6:19), yet churchmen seldom dared to \naccept the Bible\'s own presentation of God as the maker of evil: "I form \nthe light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I the \nLord do all these things" (Isaiah 45:7). On the basis of this scripture, \nsome advanced the theory that God had deliberately created the devil \nbefore the beginning of the world, because a pre-existing evil principle \nwas necessary to "test the faith" of the future human race. 9 Yet \nsomehow, to make a devil was not evil if God did it. \n\nThe Persians believed God and the devil were twin brothers, born \nsimultaneously from the womb of the dualistic mother of Infinite \nTime, Zurvan. The devil (Ahriman) was cast down from heaven to the \nunderworld only because his sacrifice, like Cain\'s, was not acceptable \nto the older deity. The heavenly god (Ahura Mazda) continued to reign \nin the heights because he knew how to make the right sacrifices. \n\nBut the devil, not the god, was the true creator of the earth and all \ncreatures in the mundane world of matter. Thus the Magi prayed to \nhim for assistance in all worldly endeavors, and revered him as the \nsource of their magic powers. Ahriman was worshipped in Roman \ntimes throughout northern Europe, identified with all chthonian gods \nlike Pluto, Saturn, or Dis Pater. 10 In early Christian mystery-plays he \nappeared as a wonder-working spirit, one Saint Mahown. 11 \n\nThe Christian devil became a composite of ancient deities in a \nsingle Protean form. He had the goat-horns and hoofs of satyr-gods \nlike Pan, Marsyas, and Dionysus; the trident of Neptune, Hades, or \nShiva; the reptilian form of Leviathan, Python, or Ouroborus; the \nfiery form of Agni or Helios; the female breasts of Astarte-Ishtar; the \nwolf face of Dis, Feronius, or Fenrir; the quadruple wings of \nBabylonian cherubim; the bird claws of ancestral spirits, the aves; and all \nthe god-names Christians had ever heard, including many secret \nnames of their own God: Jupiter, Mercury, Minerva, Venus, Hades, \nPluto, Baal-Zebub, Lucifer, Zeus Chthonios, Sabazius, Belial, Ado- \nnis, Sabaoth, Iao, Soter, Emmanuel, Sammael. 12 The devil could take \nany shape, even a human one: Pope Gregory IX described him as "a \npale, black-eyed youth with a melancholy aspect." 1? At other times he \nwas an animal composite, as on the Amulet of Bes: \n\nNaked genius with the head of Bes, flanked by seven heads of animals \namong whom are bull, lion, and ibis, and surmounted by atef crown \nwith several horns; four wings; falcon-tail and crocodile-tail; four arms \ntwo arms stretched out along the wings hold lances and serpents, while \nthe third on the left seizes a lion, the fourth on the right holds sceptre and I \nwhip. The erect penis ends in a lionhead; there are lionmasks on the \nknees, the feet are given the form of jackal-heads with pointed ears and \nprolonged as coiled snakes. Bes stands on an ouroboros (cosmic \nserpent) which contains various animals: scorpion, crocodile, tortoise. M I \n\n\n\n226 \n\n\n\nThe devil\'s popular nickname Old Scratch came from a Germanic Devil \n\nwood-spirit called a Scrat or Waldscrat, sometimes a protector of \n\nhouseholds known as Schraetlin or "little Scrat." The spirit inhabited \n\na phallic amulet based on the bisexual lingam-yoni, as suggested by \nAnglo-Saxon scritta, Old English scrat, a hermaphrodite. Another \nnickname of the devil, Deuce, came from Gaulish gods called Dusii, a \nvariation oldeus, "god." Again there was a hermaphroditic connota- \ntion, since "deuce" also meant "two." 15 \n\nSome demonologists postulated seven devils, one for each of the \nseven deadly sins: Lucifer (pride), Mammon (avarice), Asmodeus \n(lechery), Satan (anger), Beelzebub (gluttony), Leviathan (envy) and \nBelphegor (sloth). Belial, a slightly less prestigious spirit, governed \nsuch "vessels of iniquity" as playing cards and dice. 16 \n\n"Devils" and "the devil" were interchangeable. The devil was \none, and also many: a monotheistic transformation of a polytheistic \nconcept. Christian nations asserted that all other nations worshipped \n"devils" or "the devil" under many names. A 16th-century list of \ndevil-worshipping countries included: Tartary, China, Lapland, Fin- \nland, the Northern Islands, the East Indies, Persia, Arabia, Anatolia, \nEgypt, Ethiopia, Turkey, Russia, and Norway. 17 According to the 18th- \ncentury German theologian Johann Beaumont, any person anywhere \nin the world who "confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh" \nbelongs to the devils. 18 \n\nAs God incarnated himself in earthly flesh, so the devil was \nsupposed to incarnate himself in earthly flesh shortly before the \ncoming of doomsday. This demonic being was usually called Antichrist. \nHe would be known by his Christlike ability to perform healing \nmiracles, such as restoring sight to the blind. 19 It was never explained \nhow these demonic miracles were to be distinguished from holy ones. \nThe coming of Antichrist was constantly announced, dozens of times in \nj each century. Canon Moreau and contemporary churchmen report- \ned that Antichrist was born in 1 599 at Babylon, where the Jews \nacclaimed him as their Messiah. 20 Apparently he was identified with \nthe Messianic Elijah for whom the Jews looked each year at Passover. \n\nIf there were any devilish attributes on which most myths agreed, \nthey were the rather godlike qualities of (1) superhuman intelligence, \nand (2) superhuman sexuality. Inquisitor Jean Bodin wrote, "It is \ncertain that the devils have a profound knowledge of all things. No \ntheologian can interpret the Holy Scriptures better than they can; no \nlawyer has more detailed knowledge of testaments, contracts and \nactions; no physician or philosopher can better understand the composi- \ntion of the human body, and the virtues of the heavens, the stars, \nbirds and fishes, trees and herbs, metals and stones." Inquisitor Nicholas \nRemy said the devil had complete knowledge of everything human \nbeings could not explain. "Everything which is unknown lies ... in the \ncursed domain of demonology; for there are no unexplained facts. \nWhatever is not normal is due to the Devil." 21 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n227 \n\n\n\nDevil No Christian was permitted to disbelieve in the devil. His credibility \n\nrested on the same foundation as that of God. Indeed, the very \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m concept of salvation depended on the devil. If there had been no \nTempter, there was no original sin, no fall, no hell, no need of a \nredeemer or a church. De Givry correctly said, "If the Satanic concept \nis tampered with, the whole edifice laboriously erected by the Fathers \nof the Church crumbles to the ground." 22 \n\nThe devil was essential to the dualistic theology that Christianity \ncopied from Persia. If the world was divided between the forces of \ngood and evil, an evil deity was necessary, otherwise evil would have to \nbe blamed on God. Logically, a god couldn\'t be both all-good and all- \npowerful. If God could make a world without evil, and would not, he \ncouldn\'t be all-good. If God wanted to make a world without evil, \nand could not, he couldn\'t be all-powerful. The only solution not a \ngood one, but the only possible one was to supply God with an \nevenly matched adversary, to be responsible for evil. Thus theologians \nthought it the worst heresy, "contrary to the true faith," to suggest \nthat devils existed only in the ignorant imagination. 23 The devil was so \nreal to Martin Luther that he accosted him one evening and threw an \ninkpot at him. 24 \n\nIt was a severe theological problem to account for God\'s apparent \nhelplessness to halt the devil\'s activity. Though Lucifer or Satan was \nsupposed to have been utterly defeated and immobilized during the \nfamous War in Heaven, yet he was so lively that the War seemed to \nhave caused him nothing more than a momentary inconvenience. \nTheologians could only propose that God "permitted" the devil\'s \nfreedom of action. They said, "It is not the witch\'s ointment nor her \nincantation that makes her forked stick fly through the air, but the \npower of the devil, allowed by God." 25 They never explained why the \nchurch punished what God allowed. \n\nMuch semantic hairsplitting went into defining relationships be- \ntween the devil, God, and humanity, such as the distinction between \nsorcery and witchcraft. Sorcery was evoking spirits to "carry out those \npowers which God permitted the Devil." Witchcraft was evoking \nspirits to "commit acts against His ruling." In practice, a man who asked \nthe devil to help him seduce a woman was not guilty of any crime, \nbecause sex was under the devil\'s jurisdiction, by God\'s order. Devils \nwho killed children did nothing sinful, for God permitted them to kill \nchildren "in order to punish their parents." 26 On the other hand, a \nwoman who tried to save her dying child with witch-herbs was \nmortally guilty and deserved the death penalty. 27 \n\nTheologians argued that all works of witches were brought about \nby the devil with God\'s permission. Even a witch who did only good \nworks, like healing the sick, must suffer the same death as a witch whose \nacts were harmful. 28 Thus witches were placed in a no-win situation. \nOnce a man beat a witch for casting a spell on his son, and forced her to \nremove the spell. Pope Benedict XIV ruled that the witch committed \n\n\n\n228 \n\n\n\na double sin by using the devil\'s power twice, even though she did it \nunder coercion the second time. Benedict carefully stipulated that the \nman who beat her was entirely innocent of wrongdoing. 29 \n\nThe church created the idea that witches were the devil\'s helpers, \ninvolved in a vast plot to undermine Christian society. This theory \nwas the real root of the witch mania. The people were generally \nindifferent to the priests\' witch-hunting until this theory was forced \non them by propaganda from the pulpit, which deliberately played on \ntheir fear of the devil after stimulating it in the first place. 50 \n\nIt sometimes happened that churchmen themselves consulted the \ndevil, without paying the same penalties they inflicted on lay persons. \nSome miracle-working heretics were convicted by the bishop of Besan- \ncon in 1 1 70, on the evidence of none other than Satan, interviewed \nby the bishop with the help of a priest skilled in necromancy. Satan \nassured the bishop that the accused were indeed his servants, so they \nwere sent to the stake. 31 \n\nThe devil was useful to clergymen or anyone else seeking an \nexcuse for lecherous behavior. According to one story: \n\nThe devil transformed himself into the appearance of St. Silvanus, Bishop \nof Nazareth, a friend of St. Jerome. And this devil approached a noble \nwoman by night in her bed and began first to provoke and entice her with \nlewd words, and then invited her to perform the sinful act. And when \nshe called out, the devil in the form of the saintly Bishop hid under the \nwoman \'s bed, and being sought for and found there, he in lickerish \nlanguage declared lyingly that he was Bishop Silvanus. On the morrow \ntherefore, when the devil had disappeared, the holy man was scandal- \nously defamed. 32 \n\nSome sly fellows used the devil to defraud. There was a \nCornishman who convinced his neighbors that he had sold his soul to \nthe devil. Taking a few coins to the tavern each night, he pretended \nto receive money from the devil to pay for his drink. He would thrust his \nhat up the chimney, calling on his diabolic friend; and the coins \nappeared in his hat. The superstitious innkeeper wouldn\'t touch the \ndevil\'s money, so the Cornishman drank all evening for free. 35 \n\nThe devilish pact was not a joke, however; it was an essential \ningredient of the devil-mythology that killed millions during six \ncenturies of witch-hunting. Yet it was logically absurd. If the devil \nreceived the soul of every sinner, as the church taught, he had no \nneed to secure it with a "pact"; it would be his anyway. As for the \nsinners themselves, they seemed to derive little benefit from their side \nof the contract, as Scot pointed out: any woman in her right mind would \nreject the devil\'s bargain, saying, "Why should I hearken to you, \nwhen you will deceive me? Did you not promise my neighbor Mother \nDutton to save and rescue her; and yet lo she is hanged?" 34 \n\nEarly in the Christian era there were no very severe punishments \nfor making a pact with the devil. The Golden Legend tells of a young \nman who signed over his soul to the devil to win the love of a certain \n\n\n\nDevil \n\n\n\n\n\n\n229 \n\n\n\nDevil lady. Later, St. Basil prayed over the young man and retrieved his \n\ncontract, a piece of paper which dropped from an upper balcony of the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ church, "fluttered down through the air and fell into his hands, in the \nsight of all." The paper was torn up and the youth set free. 55 \n\nSeveral popes were said to have made a diabolic pact, including \none who may have ideological roots in a genuine pagan tradition: \nSilvester II. His real name was Gerbert de Aurillac. He grew up in a \nFrance still permeated by Dianic and druidic fairy-religion, where \nAphrodite was worshipped at Rouen up to the 12th century, and the \nMoon-goddess\'s groves attracted pilgrims up to the 14th. Silvester \nchose a papal name meaning "spirit of the grove," and it was said he \nhad a fairy mistress named Meridiana (Mary-Diana), who taught him \nthe secrets of magic. 36 According to Cardinal Benno and William of \nMalmesbury, Silvester signed a pact with the devil to achieve the \npapal throne, and the devil gave it to him. 37 \n\nThe truth about Pope Silvester was that he had unusually intellec- \ntual tastes for his time. He remarked that, for the frustrations and \ndifficulties of his life, "philosophy was the only cure." 38 In his time, \n"philosophy" didn\'t mean Christian theology. It meant pagan litera- \nture, natural science, and Hermetism. \n\nThe list of great wen in those centuries charged with magic . . . is \nastounding; it includes every man of real mark, and in the midst of \nthem stands one of the most thoughtful popes, Silvester II (Gerbert), and \nthe foremost of medieval thinkers on natural science, Albert the Great. \nIt came to be the accepted idea that, as soon as a man conceived a wish to \nstudy the works of God, his first step must be a league with the devil. 39 \n\nAnother "devilish" philosopher was Heinrich Cornelius Agrip- \npa von Nettesheim, historiographer to Emperor Charles V, author of \nthe famous treatise on Hermetism, De occulta philosophia. The \nchurch execrated his works and severely reprimanded him for trying to \ndefend accused witches, but his wealthy patrons protected him from \narrest: only once he was imprisoned for debt, not heresy. 40 He called \nmagic the perfect science, and implied as the Gnostic heretics did \nthat knowledge came to man not as a gift of God but as a gift of the \ndevil. \n\nAgrippa\'s life story contributed to the legend of Faust, around \nwhich centered many thrilling tales of the devil\'s pact. The real Faust \nwas not impressive. As an obscure schoolmaster in Kreuznach, he was \ndismissed from his post in 1 507 on a charge of sodomy. 41 Six years \nlater he reappeared as an astrologer and soothsayer calling himself the \nDemigod of Heidelberg. Later, citizens of Munster knew him as "the \nfamous necromancer, Dr. Faustus." Ultimately, his fame rested not on \nany of his doings but on the so-called Faustian books, Hb\'llenzwange, \n"Harrowings of Hell," which he didn\'t write. These anonymous works \ngrew into a large body of literature professing to tell the reader how to \nmake a pact with the devil, work magic, find buried treasure, win love \nand fortune, and finally renounce the pact in time to save one\'s soul. \n\n\n\n230 \n\n\n\nPredictably, such books were enormously popular. Two books really \nwritten by Agrippa von Nettesheim to win the favor of Margaret of \nAustria, The Superiority of Women and The Nobility of the Female \nSex, were declared heretical and forbidden publication by the clergy. 42 \n\nMagic books nearly always gave formulae for negotiating with the \ndevil. Le Dragon Rouge told the aspiring wizard to address "Emper- \nor Lucifer, master of all the rebellious spirits," and his ministers \nLucifuge Rofocale, Prince Beelzebub, and Count Ashtoreth. 4B Mag- \nic Papyri that had been early models for these books often confused the \nnames and attributes of Jehovah and Lucifer, speaking of "God the \nlight-bringer (Lucifer), invincible, who knoweth what is in the heart of \nall life, who of the dust hath formed the race of men." 44 We have \nseen the same kind of confusion in Christian theology itself. Yet in \n14th-century Toulouse, witches were burned for saying what was \nactually a tenet of the church\'s dualism: that "God and the Devil were \ncompletely equal, the former reigning over the sky and the latter the \nearth; all souls which the Devil managed to seduce were lost to the \nMost High God and lived perpetually on earth or in the air." 45 \n\nEven up to the 20th century, churchmen insisted on the devilish \npact. Father Thurston wrote: "In the face of Holy Scripture and the \nteaching of the Fathers and theologians the abstract possibility of a pact \nwith the Devil and of a diabolical interference in human affairs can \nhardly be denied." 46 But the Fathers and theologians never explained \nhow the devil could profit from the pact, other than to receive a \n"soul" that was his anyway. As Samuel Butler said, no one heard the \ndevil\'s side of any story, because God wrote all the books. 47 \n\nOne might think an "enlightened" modern society would have \ngiven up the idea of the devil. But a poll taken in 1978 showed "two \nout of five Americans believe in devils." 48 The strange viability of devils \nmay arise from their usefulness in assuaging the guilt of God and \nman. "Both Judaism and Christianity have maintained that God must \nbe given the credit for all the goodness in human history, and that \nmen must take the blame for all the evil." 49 Thus, the real purpose of \nthe devil was to take some of this heavy responsibility off frail human \nshoulders. In short: the devil, not Christ, was the true scapegoat who \nassumed the burden of men\'s sins. \n\n1. Larousse, 317. 2. Scot, 444. 3. Tennant, 13. 4. Briffault 2, 564. \n\n5. Scot, 323-25. 6. J.H.

Her true spirit moved within and behind these things, unseen. \nThrough the life of the universe she constantly arranged and re- \narranged the outward manifestations of her "order" to make infinite \nnumbers of different living forms. At doomsday she destroyed them \nall, to begin over with the next creation. See Tohu Bohu. \n\n1. Lindsay, O.A., 75, 120. \n\n\n\nDiamond \n\nLiterally, "World-Goddess." The ancients used to believe gem \nstones were solidified drops of the divine essence, embedded in rocks \nwhen the world was created. Diamonds were sacred to the Mother of \nthe gods because they "ruled" all other stones by their superior \nhardness. In Tantric Tibet, the divine essence of the Earth-goddess \nTara is still assumed to inhabit her human incarnation, the Diamond \nSow, traditional consort or feminine counterpart of the Dalai Lama. \n\nBecause diamonds were sacred to the supreme Goddess, they were \ntaken over by the cult of the Virgin; and because of this association \nwith virginity they came to be considered appropriate betrothal gifts. In \nthe transition from Tarot cards to modern playing cards, diamonds \nreplaced the ancient suit of pentacles, which were symbols of Mother \nEarth (Tara) and of the feminine earth element. \n\n\n\n232 \n\n\n\ni \n\n\n\nDiana \n\n"Queen of Heaven," Roman name for the Triple Goddess as (1) \nLunar Virgin, (2) Mother of Creatures, and (3) the Huntress (Destroy- \ner). Her Greek name was Artemis. Her major pilgrimage centers \nwere Ephesus and Nemi, the Sacred Grove. She was Dione, Diana \nNemorensis, or Nemetona, Goddess of the Moon-grove. In her \nsanctuaries, sacred kings periodically engaged in combat, the loser dying \nas the god Hippolytus, the winner invested as the Goddess\'s new \nfavorite, Virbius. See Hippolytus, Saint. \n\nAs Diana Egeria, patroness of childbirth, nursing, and healing, the \nGoddess made Nemi\'s holy spring the Lourdes of pagan Rome. 1 The \nlegendary King Numa was said to have derived all his wisdom from a \nsacred marriage with her. \n\nDiana\'s cult was so widespread in the pagan world that early \nChristians viewed her as their major rival, which is why she later \nbecame "Queen of Witches." The Gospels commanded total destruc- \ntion of all temples of Diana, the Great Goddess worshipped by "Asia \nand all the world" (Acts 19:27). \n\nRoman towns all over Europe habitually called the local mother \ngoddess Diana, as later Christian towns were to call her Madonna. \nFortunatus said Diana was the Goddess worshipped at Vernemeton, \n"which in the Gaulish language means the Great Shrine." In the 5th \ncentury a.d., the Gauls regarded her as their supreme deity. Christians \nspoke slightingly of their pagan custom of adoring the spirit of Diana \nin a cut branch or a log of wood. 2 Gozbert, a 7th-century Frankish \nchieftain, doubted the claims of a Christian missionary on the ground \nthat the Christian God was "no better than our own Diana." 3 \n\nAt Ephesus, the Goddess was called Mother of Animals, Lady of \nWild Creatures, and Many-Breasted Artemis, shown with her entire \ntorso covered with breasts to nourish the world\'s creatures. 4 In the 4th \ncentury a.d., the church took over this shrine and re-dedicated it to \nthe virgin Mary. 5 One of the earliest churches devoted to "Our Lady" \nexisted at Ephesus in 43 1 ; but most of the people believed the Lady \nwas Diana, not Mary. In 432 the Council of Ephesus tried to eliminate \nworship of the pagan Goddess, but the bishops were besieged by \ncrowds demanding, "Give us our Diana of the Ephesians!" 6 \n\nAn excuse for converting Diana\'s temples into Mary\'s churches \nwas provided by a made-to-order legend that Mary lived at Ephesus \nin her old age. Her tomb was located there, and some Christians even \npointed out the house in which she had lived. 7 But sometimes she \nwas identified with the sinister Widow of Ephesus, a Crone aspect of \nthe Goddess showing some primitive features. \n\nPetronius\'s version of the myth said the Widow hung her hus- \nband\'s dead body on one of the three crosses in front of Diana\'s \ntemple, replacing the body of a previously crucified thief. Then she lay \nwith her new lover at the foot of the cross. 8 The parallel between this \nimage and that of the triple Mary at the foot of Jesus\'s cross was too \n\n\n\nDiana \n\n\n\nVenantius Honorius \nClementianus \nFortunatus 6th- \ncentury poet, bishop of \nPoitiers, still venerated \nas a saint in France. \n\n\n\n233 \n\n\n\nDiana close for comfort, especially since Diana herself was assimilated to the \n\nChristian myth as Mary\'s mother, or elder self, the "Grandmother of \n^^^^^^^^^^^ God" under the name of either Anna (Hannah) or Di-anna \n(Dinah). 9 \n\nGnostic Christians called their Wisdom-goddess Sophia the same \nGrandmother of God, and frequently identified her with Diana of \nEphesus. When Diana\'s temple was finally pulled down, as the Gospels \nordered, its magnificent porphyry pillars were carried to Constantino- \nple and built into the church of Holy Sophia. 10 \n\nThe magic of Ephesus was remembered through the Middle Ages. \nA writer said in 1725: "It is recorded in divers authors that in the \nimage of Diana, which was worshipped at Ephesus, there were certain \nobscure words or sentences . . . written upon the feet, girdle and \ncrown of the said Diana: the which, if a man did use, having written \nthem out, and carrying them about him, he should have good luck in \nall his businesses." 11 \n\nSome Christians even remembered that Diana was once the triple \ndeity who ruled the world. A 14th-century poem attributed to the \nBishop of Meaux said Diana was an old name for the Trinity. 12 \n\nOfficers of the Inquisition however regarded Diana as the "God- \ndess of the heathen" with whom witches made their aerial night \njourneys or thought they did. 13 The worship of Diana was denounced \nwherever it was found, even when the worshippers were members of \nthe clergy. In the 14th century, a bishop found the monks of Frithel- \nstock Priory worshipping a statue of "the unchaste Diana" at an altar \nin the woods, and made them destroy it. 14 The notorious inquisitor \nTorquemada declared bluntly that Diana is the devil. 15 \n\nDevil or not, Diana ruled the wild forests of Europe through the \nmedieval period. As patron of the forest of Ardennes she was Dea \nArduenna; as patron of the Black Forest she was Dea Abnoba. 16 \nSerbians, Czechs, and Poles knew her as the woodland Moon- \ngoddess Diiwica, Devana, or Dziewona. 17 She remained the Goddess \nof wild woodlands and hunting, all the way up to the 18th century in \nEngland. \n\nDianic rites were celebrated even in church, despite objections \n\nfrom the clergy. A minister wrote against the traditional parade of a \n\nstag\'s head into St. Paul\'s Cathedral in London: "bringing in procession \n\ninto the church the head of a deer, fixed on the top of a long spear or \n\npole, with the whole company blowing Hunters Horns in a sort of \n\nhideous manner; and with this rude pomp they go up to the High \n\nAltar, and offer it there. You would think them all the mad Votaries of \n\nDiana." 18 \n\nl.Frazer,G.B.,5,10. 2. Graves, W.G., 273-74. 3. Reinach, 153. \n\n4. Neumann, G.M., pi. 35. 5. Ashe, 185. 6. Legman, 661. 7.

As Dido-Anna she was the consort \nof the Tyrian god Melek-Heracles, who died by fire as a sacrificial \nvictim each year. According to Roman myth, Dido chose Aeneas as her \nsacred king and was going to sacrifice him, but he escaped and fled, \nleaving her to perish in his place. He survived to become the founder of \nRome. \n\nAnother of Dido\'s names was Elissa, "the Goddess." \n\n\n\nDike var. Dice \n\nAlternative spelling of the Greek Fate-goddess Tyche, whom the \nOrphics called Eurydice, "Universal Dike."

They sought an honest man because \nthey believed they were living in the last age of the world, and the \nGoddess would destroy it when there was not one honest man still living \n\nSin it. \nThis matched the Oriental concept of the Kali Yuga, last age of \nI the world, when men become callous, violent, disorderly, and dishon- \norable. 2 When these conditions were completely fulfilled, doomsday \nwas imminent. \n\nThe word "cynical" descended from the implication that, despite \nI Diogenes\'s lifelong search, he never found the one honest man \nwhose existence still prevented the earth\'s destruction.

His only fault was that he never existed. \n\nDionysius\'s works were forged about the 6th century a.d. and \npalmed off as the work of one Dionysius the first bishop of Athens, \nsupposedly converted to Christianity by St. Paul personally, during the \nlatter\'s spirit-visit to Greece as a ghost, after having been "caught up \nto the third heaven." Paul told pseudo-Dionysius about heaven, and \npseudo-Dionysius wrote it down and preached it from the Athenian \nHill of Ares; hence his title, Areopagite. \n\nThe medieval church based its organization of three sacraments, \nthree holy orders, and three lower orders on the spurious revelations \nof Dionysius, in imitation of the heavenly hierarchy he described, \nconsisting of (1) Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; (2) Dominions, \nVirtues, and Powers; (3) Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. The \nspirits of heaven remained thus organized all the way up to the 18th \ncentury. \n\nChurchmen reluctantly abandoned their belief in the authenticity \nof Dionysius\'s writings when it was pointed out that, despite earlier \nscholars\' unquestioning acceptance, they failed the simplest of chrono- \nlogical tests, constantly referring to events and institutions of much \nlater date than the time of the alleged Dionysius. 1 At first the pious tried \nto pretend these references were miraculous prophecies of the future, \nbut this defense proved untenable. \n\n1. White 2, 315-16. \n\n\n\nDionysus \n\nIdentified with many other savior-gods, Dionysus was also called \nBacchus, Zagreus, Sabazius, Adonis, Antheus, Zalmoxis, Pentheus, \nPan, Liber Pater, or "the Liberator." l His totem was a panther (Pan- \nthereos, the Beast of Pan). His emblem was the thyrsus, a phallic scepter \ntipped with a pine cone. His priestesses were the Maenads, or \nBacchantes, who celebrated his orgies with drunkenness, nakedness, and \nsacramental feasting. \n\nDionysus is often presented as a rustic wine-god, inventor of \nviniculture. He was more than that. He was a prototype of Christ, \nwith a cult center at Jerusalem as well as nearly every other major city in \nthe middle east. Plutarch said the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was \ncelebrated in his honor: "I think that the festival of the Sabbath is not \nwholly without relation to the festival of Dionysus." 2 He added that \nthe Jews abstain from pork because their god Dionysus-Adonis (Lord \nDionysus) was slain by a boar. In the 1st century B.C. the Jews \nthemselves claimed to worship Dionysus under his Phrygian name of \nZeus Sabazius. 5 \n\nTacitus said Dionysus Liber was the god of Jerusalem in a former \n\n\n\n236 \n\n\n\ntime, but a different god had replaced him, a god with less attractive Dionysus \n\ncharacteristics: "Liber established a festive and cheerful worship, while \n\nthe Jewish religion is tasteless and mean." 4 Dionysus and Jehovah \n\nwere literally two sides of the same coin in the 5th century B.C., when ^\'"\'^^^^^^^^ \n\ncoins found near Gaza showed Dionysus on one side, and on the \n\nother a bearded figure labeled JHWH Jehovah. 5 \n\nIn Lebanon, Dionysus was incarnated in Ampelus, a "beautiful \nyouth" torn to pieces by a bull and reincarnated as a grapevine. In \nChios, the blood of men murdered by Dionysus\'s Maenads was used to \nfertilize the vines. At Orchomenus, the Triple Goddess appeared in \nDionysian rites as "three princesses" who tore apart a male child and ate \nhim (the earth absorbing sacrificial blood). In Thebes, a king named \nPentheus dared to oppose the Dionysian cult, perhaps because he didn\'t \ncare to die like other Dionysian god-kings. But the women tore him \nto pieces anyway, led by the king\'s own mother (or mother-goddess), \nwho wrenched his head off. 6 Later Theban rites of Dionysus cen- \ntered on killing and eating a fawn named Pentheus, and the Maenads \nwore fawn skins. The god\'s Lydian totem was a fox, Bassareus, \nforerunner of the medieval Reynard. There the Maenads called them- \nselves Bassarids, and wore fox skins. 7 \n\nThese darker legends show Dionysus\'s typical "savior" pattern: \nfirst and most primitive, a king killed and cannibalized to provide both \nthe earth and women\'s wombs with fructifying blood; then a surrogate \nfor the king, a condemned criminal or a young man chosen by lot; \nthen an animal substitute for the man; and finally, "flesh" and "blood" \ndevoured in the form of bread and wine, the classical Dionysian \nsacrament at Eleusis. \n\nIn Palestine, Dionysus was identified with Noah, the first biblical \npatriarch to get drunk (Genesis 9:21). His Greek title was Deucalion, \n"New-wine sailor," the flood hero in pre-Hellenic myths. 8 Dionysus \nwas also a form of Adam, offspring of Father Heaven and Mother \nEarth (Zeus and Demeter), torn to pieces to make a sin offering of the \n"wine" of his blood. 9 His later hero-incarnation Orpheus, star of the \npopular Orphic Mysteries, was the same sacrificial god, torn to pieces by \nthe Maenads. Proclus said, "Orpheus, because he was the principal in \nthe Dionysian rites, is said to have suffered the same fate as the god." 10 \n\nOrpheus was a third-generation savior, identified with his divine \n[father Dionysus as Dionysus was identified with his divine father \nZeus. Seated on the Heavenly Father\'s throne, brandishing his light- \nning-scepter, Dionysus was hailed as King of Kings and God of \nGods. 11 He was also the god-begotten, virgin-born Anointed One \nUChristos) whose mother seems to have been all three forms of the \nTriple Goddess: the earth mother, Persephone the underworld queen, \nSemele the moon-maiden. Hints of a hanging or crucifixion ceremo- \nny appeared in his sacrificial title Dendrites, "Young Man of the \n[Tree." 12 He was also a Horned God, with such forms as bull, goat, \nand stag. \n\nAccording to the classic story of his dismemberment, the god took \n\n237 \n\n\n\nDionysus \n\n\n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and \ngeographer of the 2nd \ncentury a.d. Living in \na time of declining \nculture, he was \ninspired by a desire to \ndescribe the ancient \nsacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nsuch animal forms in rapid succession to avoid the onslaught of the \nTitans (pre-Hellenic earth-deities), who eventually caught him, tore \nhim to pieces, and devoured him. They trapped his soul in a mirror \nwhile he was admiring his reflection, which equates Dionysus with the \nspring-flower god Narcissus, another of his many disguises. Accord- \ning to Pausanias, it was Onomakritos who made the Titans into \n"authors of Dionysus\'s sufferings," but the orgia had not included \nthis detail of old. Probably one of the god\'s oldest forms was Dionysus \nMelanaigis, "Dionysus of the Black Goatskin," a scapegoat-satyr like \nMarsyas. 13 His traditional costume contributed much to the medieval \nChristian notion of the devil\'s habit of appearing in the form of a \nblack goat. \n\nAt Eleusis, the place of his "Advent," Dionysus appeared as a \nnewborn Holy Child laid in a winnowing-basket, liknon, from which \nhe was called Dionysus Liknites. This sacred object, his cradle, was \ncarried in his processions by a special functionary called a likno- \nphoros, cradle-bearer. 14 The liknon was the original form of the \n"manger" in which the infant Jesus was laid. All grain-gods, whose \nflesh was eaten in the form of bread, appeared as newborn babes in a \nvessel intended for seed corn. \n\nA long-remembered incarnation of the god was King Dionysus of \n\nSyracuse, who altered the custom of king-sacrifice in the 4th century \n\nB.C. When the time of his immolation approached, King Dionysus \n\nsubstituted for himself a courtier who was called Damocles, meaning \n\neither "Conquering Glory" or "Glory of Blood." Damocles was said to \n\nhave volunteered to take the king\'s place because he envied the \n\nprivileges of kingship. He enjoyed these privileges for a short while, but \n\nsoon discovered a sword suspended above his head by a single hair: \n\nsymbol of the fate of kings, in a time when they and the gods they \n\nembodied were periodically fated to die. 15 See Kingship. \n\n1.

Each wore \nhis half of the egg shell as a cap or crown. The twins were named \nCastor and Polydeuces, the latter meaning "abundant wine," perhaps a \nreference to the flowing blood of the solar Savior whom the twins \nushered in and out of the underworld in rites linked with fertility. 1 The \nname of Castor has been associated with the rite of castrating the god, \nin classical paganism defined as "the act of offering the phallus to the \nLove Goddess." 2 \n\n\n\n238 \n\n\n\nThe Love Goddess was called Venus in Rome, and her planet is Diotima \n\nthe same one that appears as both morning and evening "star." Djsj r \n\nPerhaps this was why Christians associated Pollux, the Roman form of \n\nPolydeuces, with "pollution." Like Shaher and Shalem in the land of \nCanaan, the Heavenly Twins announced the daily birth of the sun with \nthe words "He is risen," and sent him into the underworld at his daily \ndeath with the word "Peace" (Shalom, or Salaam). See Lucifer. \n\nTo Mithraic sun-worshippers the Dioscuri were symbolized by \ntwo golden stars, which still appear in the heavens as the Alpha and \nBeta stars of the constellation Gemini (the Twins). When the Dioscuri \nwere shown in anthropomorphic form in Mithraic shrines, they held \nspears or torches, one upward, the other downward, signifying the rising \nand setting directions of the sun. Their pose was standard: one twin \nhad the right leg crossed over the left, the other had the left leg crossed \nover the right. 3 The same "magic 4" leg position is seen on the \nEmperor card of the Tarot trumps. The Dioscuri were revered in \nSparta as horsemen, warriors, and war dancers. \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1, 249; 2, 406. 2. Jobes, 179. 3.

In Britain, Dis was regarded as a universal deity very like Jehovah, \nwhose later adherents, however, transformed Dis into an alternative \nname for the devil. 2 \n\n1 . Umusse, 211. 2.

Mohammedans viewed the \ndjinn as pagan semi-demons because they were connected with the \nOld Religion. See Genius. \n\n\n\nDog \n\nNo one knows when man first domesticated the dog. Evidence \nsuggests that "man" didn\'t do it at all; woman did it. In myth, dogs \naccompanied only the Goddess, guarding the gates of her after-world, \nhelping her to receive the dead. \n\nLike other carrion eaters e.g., vultures dogs, wolves, and jack- \nals were associated with funerary customs. Dogs carried the dead to \ntheir Mother. In Iran, even after it became usual to bury the dead, it was \nthought necessary to let dogs tear the corpse before burial, a survival \nof the older practice. 1 The Vendidad said the soul enroute to heaven \nwould meet the Goddess with her dogs: "Then comes the beautiful, \nwell-shapen, strong and graceful maid, with the dogs at her sides, one \nwho can discern, who has many children, happy and of high \nunderstanding. She makes the soul of the righteous go up above." 2 \n\nSemitic tradition transformed the Goddess into the Angel of \nDeath, whose approach can be seen only by dogs which is why \ndogs howl at the moon to announce a death. 3 Devonshire folklore still \nsays there is a dog in the moon who acts as a messenger of death. 4 \nThe Irish say two dogs guard the gate of death, which used to lead to \nEmania, the Moon-land; mourners were enjoined not to wail too \nloudly, lest they disturb the dogs and cause them to attack the soul at the \ngate. This and many other similar images can be traced to the ancient \nVedic concept of the moon as death\'s gate, ruled by the Goddess and \nguarded by her two dogs. 5 \n\n\n\n240 \n\n\n\n\'*ty \n\n\n\nThis Oriental symbol is still seen in an almost pure form on Tarot \ntrump #18, the card of the Moon. The conventional picture is of two \ndogs howling at the full moon in front of a gate, or two pylons, with a \nroad leading between them to a distant horizon. The scene was \nusually interpreted as having to do with death. 6 Sometimes the card was \ncalled Hecate, after the classic death-goddess whose totemic compan- \nions were dogs. 7 Her gates were guarded by the three-headed hound \nCerberus, "Spirit of the Pit." 8 In Celtic myth the gatekeeper was a \ndog named Dormarth, "Death\'s Door." 9 The same dog might be seen \non the famous Gundestrup Cauldron, guarding the yonic gate \nthrough which heroes pass on their way to death and transfiguration. 10 \n\nAccording to the Vedic tradition, the Bitch-goddess Sarama was \nthe mistress of the death dogs, and a divine huntress like Artemis, \nDiana, Anath, and other western versions of the lunar maiden. 11 \nAncient Babylon knew her as Gula, the Fate-goddess, whose symbol \nwas a dog. 12 She was assimilated to Ishtar, whose sacred king Tammuz \nwas torn to pieces by "dogs." B Under his Greek names of Adonis or \nActaeon, he was torn to pieces by the Dogs of Artemis. As the savior \nOrpheus, he was incarnated in Neanthus of Lesbos and torn to pieces \nin the Orphic temple by "dogs. " H When Athene assumed the guise of \nthe death-goddess, her priestesses filled her temple with canine \n"howlings" (houloi), like wolves or dogs singing to the moon. 15 Some- \ntimes a whole pack of dogs or priestesses? hunted souls in the \nrealm of death, like the Celtic Hounds of Annwn, which Christians \nsoon converted into the Hounds of Hell. 16 \n\nOriginally this meant the hounds of the Goddess Hel, ruler of the \nland of death. Norse myth said she gave birth to lunar wolf-dogs who \nate the flesh of the dead and carried souls to paradise. Their leader was \nManagarm, "Moon-Dog." The Prose Edda says Managarm was \n"gorged with the flesh of the death-doomed; and with red blood he \nreddens the dwelling of the gods." 17 In other words, he carried the \ndead away in primitive, carrion-eating canine fashion. \n\nAn alternative name for the Norse moon-dogs\' mother was Angur- \nboda, the Hag of the Iron Wood: an older version of Hel, sometimes \ncalled Hel\'s mother. 18 Two of Angurboda\'s canine children, Geri and \nFreki, lived in Valhalla and ate the food offered on "Odin\'s table," \nmeaning the altar. 19 This suggests that the Vedic image of the two death \ndogs passed into Norse mythology as a pair of canine gods, like the \nmany holy dogs, wolves, or jackals of the ancient world in general. \n\nOne of the oldest of these gods was Egyptian Anubis, brought \nfrom central Asia at a very early date under the name of Up-Uat, \n"Opener of the Way." He was also known as Mates, "He of the \nMother," similar to the archaic Irish word for a dog, madra. 20 This \nold Asian god was said to be a wolf, but he soon merged with the jackal \nAnubis, who was called his twin. The composite was a deity "whose \nface is like unto that of a greyhound . . . who feedeth on the dead . . . \nwho devoureth the bodies of the dead, and swalloweth hearts." In the \n\n\n\nDog \n\n\n\nProse Edda \n\nIcelandic saga, a \ncollection of traditional \nstories compiled by \nSnorri Sturluson in the \n13 th century a.d. \n\n\n\n241 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD8 predynastic period he governed sacrificial priests, "jackal-headed men \n\nwith slaughtering-knives," in an old section of the underworld. 21 \nmhmm^^^^^m Coptic Christians later identified Anubis with Cabriel, who was called a \njudge of the dead. 22 \n\nAs a lord of the land of death, Anubis became the god of \nmummification. He was often shown bending solicitously over the \nmummy of Osiris, applying the preservative mumiya from which the \nword "mummy" descended. When the Osiris cult became astrologi- \ncal, much of its imagery was transposed from the underworld to the \nheavens, including the image of Anubis. \n\nThe star of Anubis was Sothis (Sirius), the Eye of the Dog, in \nGreek, Canopis. Sirius is the star forming the "eye" of Canis Major, the \nGreat Dog. It is the brightest star in the sky. Egyptians believed it \nheld the soul of Osiris, whose rebirth coincided with the rising of the \nNile flood, when his star rose in the east. "Three wise men" pointed \nthe way to the newborn Savior: the three stars in Orion\'s belt, which \nform a line pointing to Sirius. The holy city of Anubis on earth was \nalso Canopis, the Eye of the Dog, origin of the canopic mummy-jar. \n\nAnubis came to Rome as a leading character in the Osirian \nMysteries. He was seen in processions "condescending to walk on \nhuman feet . . . rearing terrifically high his dog\'s head and neck that \nmessenger between heaven and hell displaying alternately a face \nblack as night, and golden as the day; in his left the caduceus, in his right \nwaving aloft the green palm branch. His steps were closely followed \nby a cow, raised into an upright posture the cow being the fruitful \nemblem of the Universal Parent, the goddess herself, which one of \nthe happy train carried with majestic steps, supported on his shoulders. \nBy another was borne the coffin containing the sacred things, and \nclosely concealing the deep secrets of the holy religion." 23 \n\nNot only Anubis, but many other dog-deities were worshipped \nthroughout the Roman empire. An early Roman cista from Pales- \ntrina-Praeneste showed the Moon-virgin Minerva sacrificing a naked \nMars over a cauldron, attended by her three-headed death dog, \nclearly the same as Persephone\'s or Hecate\'s Cerberus. 24 The dog as \nthe keeper of Mother\'s gate was known everywhere in antiquity, \nprobably because wild dogs were first domesticated as guardians of the \nhome threshold, doorways being generally sacred to women who \nowned the houses. In Assyria, images of dogs were buried under \nthresholds of houses, suggesting similar burials of deceased watchdogs \nin former times. 25 The dogs\' spirits continued to halt intruders, which \nmay account for the ancient custom of lifting a new bride over a \nthreshold, so the guardian spirits beneath would not think her an \nintruder but would accept her as a resident. \n\nThe Cynic sage Diogenes made himself a watchdog at the gate of \nthe Great Mother\'s temple, where he lived in "a large earthen pot," \nrepresenting the terrestrial womb. 26 Cynics were the Goddess\'s "doglike \nones" (kynikos). Their sect, founded in the 4th century B.C., professed \n\n\n\n242 \n\n\n\nto foretell the end of the world from the circumpolar constellation Ursa Dog \n\nMinor, which they called the Dog. The north pole star was the Dog\'s \n\nTail, kunos oura, the Cynosure. 27 When it moved from its place at the \n\nstill point of the turning world, according to the Cynics, the end of \nthe present universe was at hand. \n\nThe Cynic idea of the dog affixed to the north pole is still found in \nEuropean folklore. Slavs spoke of the three Zorya (triple Fate- \ngoddess), keeping "a dog which is tied by an iron chain to the \nconstellation of the Little Bear. When the chain breaks it will be the \nend of the world." 28 Egyptians similarly believed the Goddess kept \n"powers of darkness" fettered by a heavenly chain until the last days \nof the world. 29 Northern peoples said the chain held the cosmic \ndoomsday-wolf Fenrir, who would be released by the Norns (triple \nFate-goddess) to devour the heavenly father at the end of the world; this \nwould signal the destruction of all the gods. 30 Norsemen therefore \ncalled doomsday the Day of the Wolf. 31 \n\nThe Great Goddess was herself a wolf, in the very old Roman cult \nof the She- Wolf Lupa, whose original consort was Lupus, the Wolf. \nHe was also Feronius, or Dis Pater, a subterranean wolf god inherited \nfrom the Etruscans, as was the She- Wolf who suckled Rome\'s \nfounders, Romulus and Remus. The famous Lupercalian statue of the \nShe- Wolf was cast in bronze during the 5th century B.C. The two \nbabies under her belly were not part of the original work but were added \ncenturies later, to suit the Roman version of the legend. 32 \n\nThe Lupercalia may have been a corruption of Lupa-Kali; the \nOriental Great Goddess was also a she-wolf. Under her yoni-name of \nCunti she gave birth to a divine son "in the cave of the wolf," like the \nLupercal grotto. Her child was placed in a basket of rushes and set \nafloat on the Ganges, as Romulus and Remus were set afloat on the \nTiber, Moses was set afloat on the Nile, and Sargon was set afloat on \nthe Euphrates. The wolf bitch Lupa was identified with the midwife- \ngoddess Acca Larentia who took Romulus and Remus from their \nbasket, just as Akka took Sargon, and "pharaoh\'s daughter" (another \nversion of Akka) took Moses. Akka, Acca, or Acco was the same as \nHecate, who turned into a wolf bitch in Homeric legend. 33 Lupa (or \nAcca) disappeared into the sacred spring of the Lupercal grotto, \nwhere her spirit was worshipped every year at the Lupercalian festival. \n\nThere were many lupine foster-mothers in Middle-Eastern myths. \nTu Kueh, legendary founder of the Turkish nation, was preserved in \ninfancy by a holy she-wolf whom he subsequently married: that is, she \nwas the Goddess of the land in totemic form. 34 A famous Turkish \nleader was Ataturk, "the Gray Wolf." 35 Zoroaster was raised by a she- \nwolf. Cyrus the Great, born of Mandane (Moon-mother), was \nnursed by a woman whose Greek name was Cyno, her Median name \nSpako, meaning "Bitch." Siegfried too was a wolf\'s foster child; his \noldest name was Wolfdietrich. 36 \n\nThe oldest religion of the Canary Islands was a dog- or wolf-cult, \n\n\n\n243 \n\n\n\nDog traces of which are still seen in many ancient canine statues. Canary \n\nbirds and canary wine took their name from the islands, which were \n\n^^ mmmmmm ^^^^ am really named for Canis, the dog. 37 \n\nThe same name once applied to the hereditary caste of Jewish \npriests, Kohen or Cohen, from Greek kuon, "dog." 58 Because dogs \nwere associated with the old matriarchy, the epithet "dog" became an \ninsult to Semitic patriarchs; Islam forbids both women and dogs to \napproach a shrine. 59 Yet Moslems still incongruously believe the gall of \na black dog can serve as a holy amulet to purge an entire household \nof evil influences. 40 \n\nEarly Christians made an effort to assimilate the Gallo-Roman \nwolf god under the name of St. Lupus or St. Loup, "Holy Wolf." 41 \nHe was made a legendary bishop of Troyes, credited with miraculously \nturning back the invading Huns from his province; but this story was \nfiction masquerading as history. 42 The church was not wholly comfort- \nable with any of the manifestations of Lupus, who was really a \nprototype of the werewolf. Saxons used to worship him in the first \nmonth of the sacred year, called Wolf-monath (Wolf Month); but \nChristian authorities changed the name of this month to After- Yule, or \nJesu-monath. Its runic sign was a dot in a circle, the same as the \nFestival of the Circumcision of Christ (New Year\'s Day). 43 \n\nDiana the Huntress and her "dogs" had an extensive cult in \nEngland. Some of her legends merged with those of Arthur, Lance- \nlot, and other British heroes. One of the tales told how Lancelot, like \nActaeon, trespassed in the Goddess\'s greenwood and fell asleep at her \nsecret spring: \n\nThere was a Lady dwelt in that forest, and she was a great huntress, and \ndaily she used to hunt, and ever she bare her bow with her; and no man \nwent never with her, but always women, and they were shooters, and \ncould well kill a deer, both at the stalk and at the trest; and they daily \nbare bows and arrows, horns and wood knives, and many good dogs they \nhad. 44 \n\nWhen the "Lady" caught Lancelot in the forbidden place, she \ndidn\'t set her dogs on him as her forerunners had done. She only shot \nhim in the buttock, "that he might not sit on no saddle." 45 Thus he \nwas disgraced, since a warrior was supposed to show wounds only in \nfront. \n\nBecause dogs were natural companions of the housewife as well as \nthe huntress, they were often cited as witches\' familiars. A black dog \nseemed even more suspect than a black cat. The dog was frequently \nbelieved to be the animal form of a demon lover, probably because \nwomen were inclined to fondle their dogs; many women were hanged \nin England on that count alone. One witch was officially condemned \nfor having "carnal copulation with the devil in the likeness of a man, but \nhe removed from her in the likeness of a black dog." 46 \n\nGypsies told a story based on such witch trials: there was a \nbeautiful maiden whose lover was her dog. Once each year he \n\n\n\n244 \n\n\n\ntransformed himself into a man and lay with her. In due time, she gave Dog \n\nbirth to a "little white puppy," then she jumped into the river and \n\ndrowned (a popular method of disposing of witches was to drown them ^^^^_^^^__ \n\nin the so-called swimming ordeal). The demon lover assumed his \n\nhuman shape, retrieved the maiden\'s corpse, and brought her back to \n\nlife by placing the puppy-child at her breast to suck. Afterward, as in \n\nall fairy tales, they married and lived happily ever after. 47 \n\nThe black dog was the witch\'s helper in gathering materials for \ncharms. According to an exceptionally durable superstition, the \nmiraculous mandrake root could not be pulled out of the ground except \nby a black dog. This curiously formed root, called "the phallus of the \nfield," or "the devil\'s genitals," was supposed to emit a scream if \nuprooted by the unwary; and all who heard the sound would go \ninsane, or die. 48 \n\nThe Irish remembered the dog\'s connection with death and \nmaintained that true curses could be cast with a dog\'s help. Among \nthe Celts, cainte, "dog," denoted a satiric bard with magic power to \nspeak curses that would come true. 49 \n\nDogs or wolves played their ancient role of psychopomps in a \nnumber of strange stories about cathedral-building, which might be \ntraced all the way back to the Etruscan Lupus or Dis Pater, the wolf- \nheaded Lord of Death who carried sacrificial victims away. In the very \nold rite of the mundus, trenches dug for temple foundations were \nfilled with sacrificial blood. It was believed the building would be \nunstable if this blood-magic were omitted; so it was done, from Hindu \nIndia to Latium and Britain. Lupus appeared in sacred art as a wolf- \nangel carrying the victim to a blessed after-life. On an Etruscan vase, \nthe death-god Charon is assimilated to Lupus and wears a wolfskin. 50 \n\nThis notion that sacred buildings needed to be founded in blood \nhas been evident in every tradition including the Judeo-Christian \none. The Bible says when Hiel founded the city of Jericho, "he laid the \nfoundation thereof in (the blood of) Abiram his firstborn and set up \nthe gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of \nthe Lord" (1 Kings 16:34). British legend said Vortigern\'s temple \nwalls kept falling down because the blood sacrifice for their foundation \nhad been forgotten. 51 Such pagan customs continued in the Middle \nAges. Many skeletons have been found buried in walls, pillars, and \ncornerstones of churches and abbeys, placed there as supportive \nsacrifices. 52 A deaf-mute was buried under the cornerstone of a monas- \ntery near Gottingen. 53 A parish church at Holsworthy, North Devon, \nwas found in 1845 to have a skeleton in its southwest wall. 54 Illegitimate \nchildren were frequently buried in building foundations. One St. \nBenezet, or Little Bennet, was walled up in the foundation of a bridge \nat Avignon in 1 184. Five centuries later his crypt was opened, and \nSt. Benezet proved his saintly status by remaining fresh and unde- \ncayed. 55 So his ecclesiastical press agents claimed, at any rate. "It was \nreally a common thing among Christians to sacrifice children, maids, or \n\n\n\n245 \n\n\n\nDog \n\n\n\nChansons de gestes \n\nOld French epic \npoetry of the 11th to \n1 3th centuries. \n\n\n\ngrown-up people by burying them alive under the foundations of \ncastles, etc., to insure their stability." 56 \n\nWhen St. Columba founded a monastery on the island of Iona, he \ncalled for a volunteer to be buried alive in its foundation. A monk \nnamed Oran, or Odran, earned a later canonization by offering \nhimself. 57 For some reason perhaps a promise of Christ-like resurrec- \ntion he was dug up again after three days. Still alive, he began to \npreach blasphemous doctrines: there was no God, no devil, no heaven \nor hell. St. Columba therefore had him killed and re-buried. 58 It was \nnot uncommon for monks infected with Gnostic, agnostic, or atheistic \nbeliefs to meet with such a fate. \n\nEurope\'s totemic dog or wolf clans seem to have become involved \nin these sacrificial customs, just as they were involved in the ancient \ncult of the mundus. For instance, Cologne Cathedral was said to have \nbeen designed by the devil, and its bells were cast under the devil\'s \ndirection at the foundry of a mysterious smith named Wolf. After \ncasting a certain discordant bell, supposed to be rung only in time of \ndisaster, Wolf was killed by a fall from the bell tower. The architect who \ncollaborated with the devil was also killed, crushed by a great stone \nthat already had his name engraved on it. 59 \n\nChansons de gestes told a somewhat different version. The build- \ners of Cologne Cathedral killed a hero named Renaud (Fox) and \nburied him in the foundation. A church was erected to Renaud\'s \nmemory in 81 1 a.d.; a chapel stood on the spot in Cologne where he \nwas slain. 60 Some said Renaud was the same as the trickster-hero- \ndemigod Reynard the Fox; others said he was a great warrior, one of \nCharlemagne\'s paladins. \n\nThe devil and the wolf were also linked with Charlemagne\'s tomb \nat Aix-la-Chapelle. The devil contributed money to build the cathe- \ndral. In return, he demanded the life of the first creature to enter its \ndoors. At the dedication ceremony, people thrust a wolf into the \ndoor. The devil took the wolfs life. Then it was safe for people to enter. \nLike Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle had a discordant bell for emergencies. \nThe founder of this bell was crushed to death by the clapper, so the bell \nwas baptized with his blood. \n\nSimilar stories were told of Strasbourg Cathedral, supposedly \ndesigned by a wise witch named Sabine, once a title of Lupa, the \nSabine She- Wolf. The dedication of the cathedral was marked by the \nsacrifice of twin brothers, like Romulus and Remus, one of whom \nkilled the other by pushing him under a cornerstone as it was dropped \ninto place. (Of the twins nursed by the Sabine She- Wolf, Romulus \nkilled Remus while digging a furrow for the foundation of Rome\'s \nwalls.) The bishop of Strasbourg ordered the cornerstone raised \nagain, and the second brother was crushed under it also, by his wish. He \nexplained, "My body will serve as a protection to the cathedral." 61 \n\nRemnants of these curious beliefs and customs survived to the \npresent time. In World War II, the Nazi SS caused human bodies to \n\n\n\n246 \n\n\n\nbe "encased in the concrete fortifications and bunkers, as though such Dolcinists \n\nbodies could give strength to inanimate matter." 62 To this day, Greek \n\npeasants insist on a blood sacrifice at the building of any bridge, to bathe ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe foundation in the lifeblood of a bird or animal to "strengthen" \n\nit." \n\nThe notion that a dog\'s blood is equivalent to the blood of a \nhuman being is still found among the Berbers, who believe that a \nmurderer is magically tainted by the blood of his victim for the rest of his \nlife. The killer of a dog is similarly tainted. 64 Nearly everywhere one \ncan still find the belief that dogs can see ghosts and other spirits, left over \nfrom the formerly universal association of canines with the world of \ndeath and the special preserve of the underground Goddess. 65 \n\n1.

Believing himself nevertheless a true spiritual \nson of St. Francis, he gathered disciples and preached against the \nworldly wealth of the church. He was caught and burned, but the \nCongregation continued under Fra Dolcino, who preached the oncom- \ning doomsday, the fall of the sinful church, and the triumph of the \npoor and simple over the theocracy. \n\nDolcinists admitted women to their ranks, and granted their \n"sisters in Christ" the same right to preach and lead prayers as the \nmen, one of the worst manifestations of their heresy. Dolcinists claimed \nto renounce sexual relations; so when Dolcino\'s particular "dearly \nbeloved sister in Christ" Margherita di Trank bore him a child, it was \nbrought about through the miraculous agency of the Holy Ghost, \nthey said. \n\nThe Inquisition harassed the Dolcinists until they took refuge in \nthe high mountains. Three crusades were preached against them. In \nthe winter of 1 307 they were finally reduced to starvation, trapped, and \n\n\n\n247 \n\n\n\nDoomsday \n\n\n\nslaughtered. Dolcino was captured alive, unfortunately for him. After \nwatching his Margherita burn, he was torn to pieces by red-hot pincers \non a cart rolling slowly along the roads for all to watch. \n\nDespite this edifying example, Dolcinism persisted for another \ncentury. Two Dolcinist Apostles were captured and burned in \nGermany in 1404. 1 \n\n1. Lea unabridged, 614-23. \n\n\n\nPuranas are ancient \nSanskrit scriptures in \nverse, treating of cos- \nmologies, sacred \nhistories, and the nature \nof the divine. \n\n\n\nDoomsday \n\nThe universal idea of the world\'s end was rooted in ancient Hindu \nbelief in the cyclic alternation of universes, brought about by Kali. \n\nEach successive creation was divided into four yugas or ages: \nSatya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali, the fourth and last marking the age \nwhen Mother turns Destroyer because the race of men become violent \nand sinful, failing to perceive deity in the feminine principle. "Due to \nthe limited intelligence and lust of men in the Kali Yuga, they will be \nunable to recognize women as manifestations of the Shakti." Only a \nfew may escape spiritual degeneration: those who are devoted "to the \nlotus of their mothers\' feet and to their own wives." l \n\nWhen Kali\'s doomsday arrived, the gods would slay each other. \nEarth would be overwhelmed by fire and flood. The Goddess would \nswallow up everything and un-make it, returning to her primordial state \nof formless Chaos, as she was before creation. All beings would enter \nher, because "She devours all existence." 2 After a time that could not \nbe counted because even Time was destroyed, Kali would give birth \nto a new universe. \n\nThe Matsya Purana said signs of approaching doomsday were to \nbe found in the breakdown of social structures, the increase in \nviolence and crime, and the decline of human intelligence: \n\nThere is no one, any more, in whom enlightening goodness (sattva) \nprevails; no real wise man, no saint, no one uttering truth and standing \nby his sacred word. The seemingly holy Brahmin is no better than a fool. \nOld people, destitute of the true wisdom of old age, try to behave like \nthe young, and the young lack the candor of youth. The social classes \nhave lost their distinguishing, dignifying virtues. . . . The will to rise to \nsupreme heights has failed; the bonds of sympathy and love have dis- \nsolved; narrow egotism rules. . . . When this calamity has befallen the \nonce harmoniously ordered City of Man, the substance of the world- \norganism had deteriorated beyond salvage, and the universe is ripe for \ndissolution. } \n\nThe Vishnu Purana said the world in its last days reaches a stage \nwhere "property confers rank, wealth becomes the only source of virtue, \npassion the sole bond of union between husband and wife, falsehood \n\n\n\n248 \n\n\n\nthe source of success in life, sex the only means of enjoyment, and Doomsday \n\nwhen outer trappings are confused with inner religion." 4 \n\nAsiatic arts of astronomic observation and calculation of calendars ^^- B ^^^ \nwere motivated by an earnest desire to know the exact length of each \nyuga, to foresee the end. An age was supposed to begin when sun, \nmoon, and planets stood in conjunction at the initial point of the \necliptic and to end when they returned to the same point. By Hindu \nreckoning, the present yuga began in 3 1 02 B.C. The chronology of \n\'the Central American Maya began in 3 1 1 3 B.C., only 1 1 years later, "a \ndiscrepancy probably due to some minor miscalculation in reckoning \nbackward from the observed movements of the heavenly bodies." 5 \n\nAncient Mesopotamia set the same dates as India and Mexico \nbetween 3113 and 3 1 02 b.c. for the beginning of civilized arts, \nespecially astronomical calculation. The Babylonian sage Berossus said \n"the world will burn when all the planets that now move in different \ncourses come together in the Crab, so that they all stand in a straight \nine in the same sign, and . . . the future flood will take place when \nthe same conjunction occurs in Capricorn. For the former is the \nconstellation of the summer solstice, the latter of the winter solstice; \nthey are the decisive signs of the zodiac, because the turning points of \nthe year lie in them." Jeremias commented: \n\nThis Babylonian doctrine has spread over the whole world. We find it \nagain in Egypt, in the religion of the Avesta, and in India; traces of it \nare discovered in China, as well as in Mexico and among the savage \nnations of South America. To refer these phenomena back to "elemen- \ntary ideas" such as may arise independently among different peoples, will \nnot hold good in view of the circumstance that we have to do with ideas \nconnected with definite facts which rest upon continued astronomical \nobservations. 6 \n\nThese remarks shed light on the great Neolithic monuments \npiown to be astronomical calculators, suggesting a good reason why \nhey were built with so much care and effort. The Stoic philosophers \n)f doomsday drew upon a very ancient tradition in predicting the \nvorld\'s end in terms almost identical with those of Oriental sages: "A \nlew sea will overrun everything, and the Ocean, today the boundary \n.nd girdle of the world, will occupy its centre. . . . What nature has \nnade into separate parts will be confounded into a single mass." This \nreed of dissolution into Chaos became "an important part of \nitoicism." 7 \n\nNorthern Europeans drew their myths of doomsday or Ragnarok \nrom the same ancient tradition. They said the world\'s end would be \nrought about by the Mutspell (Mother\'s Curse) when violent gods \neglected the old laws of peace and blood kinship. The angry \nJoddess would become Skadi the Destroyer, a great shadow devouring \nle world, like her Oriental counterpart Kali. The gods would enter \n\n\n\n249 \n\n\n\nDoomsday that shadow of Gotterdammerung, literally the Going-Into-the-Shadow- \n\nof-the-Gods. They would be consumed, and the heavens and earth \n^^^^^aa^ with them. The world would sink back into the womb of primal chaos \nwhich gave it birth in the beginning. 8 \n\nThis was the prophecy of the sybilline priestess who wrote the \nVoluspa. It was echoed by the Irish sybil Babd, one of the three Fate- \ngoddesses. She foretold the coming of the Waste Land, "trees without \nfruit and seas without fish; old men would give false judgments and \nlegislators make unjust laws; warriors would betray one another, and \nmen would be thieves, and there would be no more virtue left in the \nworld." 9 \n\nAfter destruction of this nonvirtuous world and its cruel gods, there \nwould be a period of dark nonexistence. Then the Goddess\'s womb \nwould bring forth a new universe. A new human race would arise from \na primal couple, a woman named Life one of the Semitic names of \nEve and a man named Desirer-of-Life. 10 \n\nPatriarchal Persians made some alterations in the picture. Their \nidea of doomsday was as dire as any, with the usual convulsions of the \nearth, fires, flood, and fallings of heaven; but they denied the subse- \nquent creation of a new world. Their concept was not cyclic, but \nlinear. Creation and doomsday could occur only once. After the great \nbattle Armageddon at the end of the world, "The War of the Sons of \nLight with the Sons of Darkness," the heavenly forces of the sun god \nwould prevail. 11 They would divide the sinful from the virtuous and \nassign them to heaven or hell. The aftermath was not another creation, j \nbut eternal stasis, like the Brahman Nirvana. \n\nPassing through Jewish-Essenic and Roman-Mithraic sects into \nChristianity, this Persian doomsday became the familiar one in the west \nwith numerous details borrowed from the older Aryan paganism. The \nlast Trump played on Gabriel\'s horn was originally played on Rig- \nHeimdall\'s "ringing horn" (Gjallarhorn). 12 The Great Serpent slain \nby Thor in the final battle became identified with Satan. 13 Like \npaganism\'s sacred dramas, the final drama of the earth\'s dissolution \nwas divided into five acts. 14 Christians even translated the Norse \n"Mother\'s Curse" as "Judgment Day" when they found it variously \nrendered Mutspell, Muspell, Muspelle, Mudspeller, or Muspilli. 15 \n\nThe Savior destined to appear before the world\'s end had an old I \nform in Buddhist scriptures as Kalki Avatara, the Destroyer of Sin, \nwho would come from heaven to announce doomsday. 16 Persians \ncopied him, changing his title to Son of Man, or Messiah. Before 1 70 \nB.C., the Book of Enoch called him Christos, the Anointed One, and \nannounced that he had already come and gone, and that his Second \nComing was expected at any moment. 17 \n\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus identified himself with this person \nage who would be seen "coming in the clouds with great power and \n\n\n\n250 \n\n\n\nglory. And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his Doomsday \n\nelect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the \n\nuttermost part of heaven" (Mark 13:26-27). Jesus was not the only ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nMessiah of his time. Josephus said before 70 a.d. there were countless \n\nMessiahs and Christs announcing the end of the world. 18 \n\nThe Gospels promised doomsday almost at once. Jesus said it \nwould occur in his own generation: "There be some standing here, \nwhich shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God" (Luke \n9:27). Early Christians accordingly expected the world\'s end so soon \nthat there was no reason to marry and beget children who would never \ngrow up, a major reason for Christianity\'s renunciation of marriage. \nMotherhood would only harm women in the convulsions of the last \ndays: "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give \nsuck, in those days!" (Luke 21:23). \n\nHopeful Christians found that Jesus\'s generation and many other \ngenerations passed without apocalyptic symptoms. Seeking an expla- \nnation, theologians discovered the text saying a thousand years were but \na day in the sight of God (Psalms 90:4), another borrowing from \nOriental sages who said a Day of Brahma lasted a thousand years. On \nthe basis of this scripture it was decided that the world would end in \nthe year 1000 a.d. With the approach of that year, Europe was seized \nby an apocalyptic mania. Farms and towns were abandoned as \nfanatics tramped the countryside announcing the Last Days. In some \nareas, agriculture and commerce came virtually to a standstill. The \nyear passed uneventfully enough, but human society suffered greatly \nfrom famines and civil disorders caused by the doomsday belief. 19 \n\nSome Franciscans declared that Christ really had returned to earth \nin 1000 a.d., disguised as St. Francis, the new Messiah, who was \n"entirely transformed into the person of Christ." Francis was said to \nhave performed all the Christ-like miracles, cast out devils, turned \nwater into wine, cured the sick, raised the dead, made the blind see, and \nso on. 20 There were those who went so far as to claim that Christ was \nimportant only as a precursor of St. Francis. 21 \n\nNot only the Christ figure was supposed to return just before \ndoomsday, but also Antichrist, his adversary, for the final battle \nbetween good and evil couldn\'t take place until all the forces were \nassembled on either side. According to a German legend, Antichrist \ncould not come to earth as long as the Holy Roman (German) Empire \nstood. 22 This legend served to keep some of the warring nationlets in \nline at times, but the Holy Roman Empire was a rather loose, indefin- \nable entity for most of its existence. Antichrist was almost as \nconstantly anticipated as Christ. \n\nAnother who taught that the Last Judgment had already taken \nplace was Swedenborg; he gave its date as 1757, the date of the \nestablishment of his own Church of the New Jerusalem. He wisely \n\n\n\n251 \n\n\n\nDoppelganger refrained from predicting the world\'s end a short time in advance, but \n\nDove others fell into this trap, dimming, in England, predicted the end of the \n\n^ wm world in 1867, with resulting injury to his credibility when the end \nfailed to come. \n\nA prominent doomsday prophet was William Miller, inadvertent \nfounder of the sects of Jehovah\'s Witnesses and Seventh-Day Ad- \nventists. He fixed the date of the millenium on March 21, 1843. His \nfollowers were afire with enthusiasm, but still failed to see Christ \ndescending from the clouds as expected. Miller decided he had miscal- \nculated, and fixed a new date on October 21 of the same year. "On \nthe appointed day of doom frenzied believers donned their robes, \ntucked an ultimate lunch in the folds, and took their places on the \nhousetops, facing east. On the 22nd they ate their lunch and climbed \ndown. Miller confessed his disappointment, but insisted \'the day of \nthe Lord is at the door.\' " 23 The Millerites never gave up hope. Their \noffshoot sects still exist and flourish, though naive displays of credulity \nare usually avoided. \n\n1. Mahanirvanatantra, 12, 53, 56, 177. 2. Mahanirvanatantra, 295-96. \n\n3.

Sometimes the afterbirth was said to be an un- \nformed twin of the newborn baby; by magic it might assume the \nliving twin\'s shape and follow him through life. Sometimes this was \nthought to be the Doppelganger seen in one\'s reflection. \n\n\n\nDove \n\nAphrodite\'s totem, the bird of sexual passion, symbolically equivalent \nto the yoni. 1 In India, too, the dove was paravata, the symbol of lust. 2 \nJoined to her consort the phallic serpent, the Dove-goddess stood for \nsexual union and "Life." \n\nThe phrase attributed to Jesus, "Be ye therefore wise as serpents, \nand harmless as doves" (Matthew 10:16), was no random metaphor \nbut a traditional invocation of the Syrian God and Goddess. 3 The \nOriental meaning was remembered by the gypsies, whose folk tales \nsaid the souls of ancestors lived inside magic hollow mountains, the men \nhaving been changed into serpents and the women into doves. 4 \n\n\n\n252 \n\n\n\nChristians adopted the feminine dove as a symbol of the Holy Dove \n\nGhost, originally the Goddess Sophia, representing God\'s "Wisdom" \n\nas the Goddess Metis represented the "Wisdom" of Zeus. Gnostic ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nChristians said Sophia was incarnate in the dove that impregnated the \nvirgin Mary, the same dove that descended on Jesus at his baptism to \nimpregnate his mind (Matthew 3:16). Pious admirers of Pope Greg- \nory the Great made him even more saintly than Jesus by reporting that \nthe Holy Ghost in dove shape descended on him not once but many \ntimes. 5 All this was copied from Roman iconography which showed the \nhuman soul as a dove that descended from the Dove-goddess\'s \noversoul to animate the body. 6 \n\nAphrodite as a bringer of death, or "peace," sometimes bore the \nname of Irene, Dove of Peace. Another of her death-goddess names \nwas Epitymbria, "She of the Tombs." 7 Romans called her Venus \nColumba, Venus-the-Dove. Her catacombs, mausoleums, and ne- \ncropoli were known as columbaria, "dovecotes." 8 Thus the soul \nreturning to the Goddess after death was again envisioned as a dove. \nFrom this image, Christians copied their belief that the souls of saints \nbecame white doves that flew out of their mouths at the moment of \ndeath. In the Catholic ceremony of canonization, white doves are \nreleased from cages at the crucial moment of the ritual. 9 \n\nChristian iconography showed seven rays emanating from the \ndove of the Holy Ghost: an image that went back to some of the most \nprimitive manifestations of the Goddess. 10 In the Orient, the mystic \nseven were the Pleiades or "Seven Sisters," whose Greek name \nmeant "a flock of doves." They were daughters or "rays" of Aphrodite \nunder her title of Pleione, Queen of the Sea. 11 Herodotus said seven \nholy women known as Doves founded the oracles of Dodona, Epirus, \nand Theban Amon. 12 They were worshipped in the Middle East as \nSeven Sages or Seven Pillars of Wisdom: the seven woman-shaped \npillars that had been upholding temples of the Goddess since the \nthird millenium B.C. 13 See Caryatid. Arabs still revere the Seven Sages, \nand some remember that they were women, or "doves." H The \nSemitic word for "dove," ione, was a cognate of "yoni" and related to \nthe Goddess Uni, who later became Iune, or Juno. \n\nThe cult of the Doves used to incorporate primitive rites of \ncastration and its modification, circumcision. India called the seven \nSisters "razors" or "cutters" who judged and "critically" wounded men, \nthe Krittikas, "Seven Mothers of the World," root of the Greek \nkritikos, "judge." They killed and gave rebirth to gods who were \ncastrated to make them fertile, like women. The name of Queen \nSemiramis, legendary founder of Babylon, also meant "Dove" in the \nSyrian tongue. She was said to have castrated all her consorts. 15 \n\nWhen circumcision replaced castration, the doves were involved in \nthat too. Even Christian symbolism made the connection. The \n\n\n\n253 \n\n\n\nDrama official symbol of the Festival of the Circumcision of Christ was a dove, \n\nholding in its beak a ring representing the Holy Prepuce. "Christ\'s \n\n^ HMMHHH i^^^^ M fructifying blood" was linked with the similar emblem of Pentecost, \n\nwhich showed the descending dove on a background of blood red, \n\nofficially described as a representation of the church fertilized by the \n\nblood of Christ and the martyrs. 16 \n\nA certain "maiden martyr" called St. Columba (Holy Dove) was \n\nwidely revered, especially in France, although she never existed as a \n\nhuman being. 17 Another curious survival of pagan dove-lore was the \n\nsurname given to St. Peter: Bar-Iona, "Son of the Dove." 18 Some \n\nsurvivals may have been invented to explain the doves appearing on \n\nancient coins as symbols of Aphrodite and Astarte. 19 \n\n1.

The \naudience participated with songs, dances, sexual orgies, laments, eating \nthe god and rejoicing at his restoration. One object was attainment of \nreligious ecstasy: entering into the "dream." \n\nIt has been shown that every dream bears "a remarkable resem- \nblance to drama." 1 Old Norse draumar, related to German Traum \n(dream), featured a sacrificial slaying of the god, the "tragic" part of the \nperformance. 2 \n\nTragedy descended from the "goat-song" enacting the sacred \ndramas of Dionysus or Pan. The five-act structure of classical tragic \ndrama still seen in the plays of Shakespeare was established by the \nfive-act rites of the god. The acts were: (1) agon, the Contest: the \nincumbent incarnation of the god fought his challenger; (2) pathos, the \nPassion: the god united with the goddess and sent forth his soul with \nhis semen (or blood) to fertilize the world anew he died in his own \nbegetting; (3) threnos, the Lament: a "threnody" of wailings and \ngestures of grief, partly to absolve the audience of responsibility for the \ngod\'s death; (4) anagnorisis, the Discovery: priestesses returned to the \ntomb to find that the god was "risen," in much the same ritual enacted \nby Mary Magdalene and other temple-women at the tomb of Jesus \n(Luke 24:10) where, significantly, no men were present; (5) apotheosis, \nthe Deification: the resurrected victim became God, and rose to \nheaven, to be a part of his divine father. 3 On this occasion the \n\n\n\n254 \n\n\n\nworshippers threw themselves into an orgy of rejoicing, such as Droit du Seigneur \ndistinguished the Roman carnival called Hilaria, "Day of Joy," follow- \ning the death and resurrection of the savior Attis. 4 \n\nDionysus, Pan, Attis, Osiris, Orpheus, and many other gods of the \nmystery-cults contributed their dramas to medieval mystery plays, \ntheir linear descendants. The mummers\' play, the ceremonies of \nCarnival, May Day, Harvest Home and other festivals used parts of \nthe old sacred drama. Characters of the classic commedia were modeled \non some of the pagan deities. The Dove-goddess became Columbine \n(Dove). The Serpent-god became Pierrot (Big Peter, or the Pied One). \nThe name of Harlequin came from the Hellequins, or Hella cunni, \n"kindred of the Goddess Hel," souls of the pagan dead riding forth from \nher underworld. 5 \n\nMasks were customary in the early medieval drama, just as they \nwere in the plays of ancient Greece and Rome. From a magical point \nof view, the essence of the character lay in the mask, not in the actor \nwho wore it. This was the primitive theory behind all appearances of \nmask and costume in religious ceremonies, from the animal-headed \n"gods" of Egypt human bodies wearing the deities\' disguises to \nmodern priestly vestments. Savages still say that, by putting on the mask \nand costume of an animal, spirit, or deity (or all at once), they do not \nsimply make believe but actually become that creature. 6 See Mask. \n\nl.Sagan, 178. 2.

An outgrowth of the feudal system that equated ownership of \nand with ownership of women. The droit du seigneur meant that \nivery serf\'s bride must be deflowered on her wedding night not by her \n>ridegroom but by the lord of the land. \n\nAs laid down by Ewen III of Scotland in the 9th century, the law \naid wives of common folk could be raped by any nobleman at any \nime; and "the lord of the ground shall have the maidenhead of all \nirgins dwelling on the same." \' \n\nThe church upheld the droit du seigneur as a God-given right of \nle nobility. For a vassal bridegroom to consummate his marriage \n/ithin three nights after the wedding was declared blasphemous "to the \n\nbenediction" and tantamount to "carnal lust." 2 The overlord\'s \n\nhowever, was right and proper. The eastern church provided legal \n\nlties for a man who tried to consummate his marriage before his \n\ner could rape the bride.* \n\nDroit du seigneur was a general rule throughout the feudal period \n\ncontinued in Russia up to the 19th century. 4 \n\n\n\n255 \n\n\n\nDruids \n\n\n\nThe system also continued in America\'s slaveholding south before \nthe civil war, unofficially but generally acknowledged. Every black \nwoman was the sexual property of her master, whether she was married \nto another slave or not. 5 Slave marriages could be legally ignored if \nplantation owners cared to do so. In 1757, Peter Fontaine said planta- \ntion owners begot so many children on their female slaves that "the \ncountry swarms with mulatto bastards." Thomas Anburey praised the \nsystem, calling it "a pleasant method to procure slaves at a cheap \nrate." 6 \n\nl.Bullough ( 168. 2.Brasch,74. 3. Briffault 3, 242. 4. Fielding, 155. \n5.

Greek \nmyth said the dryads were oak nymphs, each an oracular priestess with \nher own personal tree spirit, like the biblical Deborah who lived \nunder a tree that bore her own name (Judges 4:5). Dryads were called \npriestesses of Artemis, whose souls dwelt in their trees. They could \nalso assume the shapes of serpents, and were then called Hamadryads, \nor Amadryades. 2 In their druidic groves throughout northern Europe, \nStrabo said, they practiced rites "similar to the orgies of Samothrace."* \n\nDryadism and druidism were two phases of the same religion, \nevidently restricted to a female priesthood in the earlier, matriarchal \nstage, later open to male priests as well. Gaulish and British priests of th< \noak groves formed a class of bardic wizards, keeping a sacred tradition \nby memorizing orally transmitted material, the nucleus of medieval \nsagas, epics, and ballads. \n\nThere is no break between the ancient semi-magical formulae chanted b 4 \nthe Druids and the later incantation of the wizard and the "wise- \nwoman. " They both arose in the Veda-like sacred hymns which formed \nthe depository of the learning professed by the body of the druidical \nteachers and diviners and taught orally in the druidic schools. Most of \nthem were never written down, and the fragments that we possess in \nwriting are probably only the remains of a considerable body of oral \nliterature. 4 \n\nDruids were attacked by the Christian church for their pagan- \nism, but especially for their propensity to include sacred women in their \nranks. Scot said even in his day there were feminine spirits associated \nwith trees, called Dryads in Greece and Druids in Scotland. They were \nshape-shifters, and could appear as either birds or women. "They \nknow our thoughts, and can prophesy of things to come." 5 \n\nDespite nominal conversion to Christianity, the Irish clung to \ndruidism for many centuries. Their revered pagan king Diarmuid was i \n\n\n\n256 \n\n\n\ncalled "half a druid and half a Christian." To make St. Patrick\'s legend Durga \n\nmore palatable to the Irish, monks claimed he had been educated by a \n\ndruid. 6 Irish churches were known by the old druidic name of dairthech, ^^^^^^^^^^ \n"oak-house," formerly applied to the sacred grove. 7 \n\nThe "colleges" of druidesses, or dryads, passed by almost imper- \nceptible degrees into a new designation of Christian nuns. One of the \nthree classes of druidesses consisted of secluded sisterhoods, like the \npriestesses of Brigit, living in convent-like sanctuaries and tending \nsacred fires that were kept perpetually burning. Another, less secluded \nclass of druidesses consisted of married women who lived at the \ntemple and went home occasionally to visit their husbands. A third class \nwas composed of temple servants who lived with their families. 8 With \nthe coming of Christianity, the high holy sisterhoods were assimilated as \nnuns. The others were usually described as witches. \n\nThe druidic religion lasted a surprisingly long time over a surpris- \ningly wide geographical area. Christians continued to worship oak \ndeities in their sacred groves through the 8th century a.d. in Hesse. \nAccording to Gildas, Christian monks copied their tonsure from the \ndruids. Traces of druidism were found as late as 1874 in Russia. 9 Even \nclearer traces were found in the 20th century in the Holy Land, \nwhere the Goddess of the sacred groves was worshipped as Asherah \nsince pre-biblical times, and was known in Canaan as progenitress of \nthe gods. 10 Her priestesses the oak-nymphs continued to be venerated \nunder the title of Benat Ya\'kob (Daughters of Jacob), said to dwell in \ntheir trees near old shrines that were rededicated to mythical Moslem \nsaints. The trees were taboo. Their wood was never taken for fuel, \nexcept for votive purposes. 11 \n\nTo some extent the mystical reverence for oak trees persists to this \nday. Many British and American towns have their venerable "Char- \nter Oak" or some superannuated tree where seasonal ceremonies take \nplace. Acorns and oak leaves are still considered appropriate for \nwreaths and harvest decorations, even if they no longer crown the \n| Goddess\'s sacred kings. \n\n1. Piggott, 105-6. 2. Lawson, 153. 3.

Durga was entitled "The Inaccessible." A crowned \nKmazon, she rode tigers into battle and defeated many demonic \nmonsters, defending her children the gods. 1 Like other forms of the \npoddess-as-warrior, such as the Middle-Eastern Ma-Bellona, Durga \n\n\n\n257 \n\n\n\nDusii drank the blood of her enemies. 2 What this really meant was that her \n\nDymphna, Saint altars or images were anointed with the blood of war captives, killed as \n\n^^g^^^B^ trophies. \n\nAs "The Inaccessible," Durga personified the fighting spirit of a \nmother protecting her young, and perhaps also the nursing mother \nsexually "inaccessible" to men, according to the old Oriental custom. \nDurga stood for the basic animal instincts of maternity, for which the \nadult male is no longer significant, and only her offspring claims a \nmother\'s attention. \n\nDurga was sometimes Shasthi, "the Sixth," Leader of the Moth- \ners. This title arose from the custom of invoking her on the sixth day \nafter childbirth, when the continuous spells for protection of mother and \nchild could be brought to an end. The seventh day was a day of rest. 3 \nThis was the true beginning of the common patriarchal legend of gods \nwho gave birth to the world in six days and rested on the seventh. \nAmong such gods were Persia\'s Ahura Mazda, Memphian Ptah, Babylo- \nnian Marduk, Syrian Baal, and the Hebraic Jehovah. 4 \n\nDurga\'s titles and character penetrated western ideas of the God- \ndess before the first century B.C. Rome\'s Great Mother Juno had the \nsame attributes as her Oriental sister; she was Juno the Preserver, \nQueen of the Mothers. 5 \n\nl.L*rousse,333. 2. O\'Flaherty, 249. 3.

Dympna Dymphna, Saint \n\nA canonization of what seems to have been a bit of graffiti on a brick \nfound near Antwerp in the 1 3th century. The brick was buried near a \ncoffin containing the bones of an unidentified man and woman. The \nwords on the brick were ma dompna, "my lady," the traditional address \nof a medieval poet to his lady-love. \n\nThough having no more basis than these words on an old brick, \n\n\n\n258 \n\n\n\nJk \n\n\n\nthe cult of St. Dymphna was carefully developed. A large asylum \nnear Gheel was named after her, so she became the patron saint of the \ninsane perhaps appropriately. To this day she is still touted as the \nintercessor for people with emotional problems. 1 \n\nl.Attwater, 108. \n\n\n\nDymphna, Saint \n\n\n\n259 \n\n\n\nThe Creation of eve, in \nthe version that says \nshe was made from one \nof Adam\'s ribs. \nFlorentine School. \nWood panel; Fra \nBartolommeo, ca. 1510. \n\neuropa and the Bull, here \nshown on a red-figure \nvase, approximately 1 1 \nby 1 1 inches. Greek, \nca. 490 b.c. \n\n\n\n\nEag\'e Eagle \n\nClassic soul-bird, symbol of apotheosis associated with the sun god, \n^^^^^^^^ fire, and lightning. Greeks thought eagles so closely akin to the lightning \nspirit that they nailed eagles to the peaks of temples to serve as magic \nlightning rods. Hence the name aetoi, "eagles," for the pediments of \nGreek temples. 1 These were ancient forerunners of the "weather- \ncock" on the rooftree of a barn or house. \n\nCults of fire and the sun made the eagle a bearer of kingly spirit: \nthe god\'s soul returning to heaven after a period of earthly incarna- \ntion as the king. 2 It was the Roman custom to release an eagle above the \nfuneral pyre of each emperor, just as an Egyptian pharoah rose to \nheaven on the wings of the solar hawk. 3 \n\nZeus himself took the shape of an eagle to carry his young lover \nGanymede to heaven. This was often interpreted as a symbol of the \nfather-god\'s reception of men\'s souls when they were initiated into the \nsolar Mysteries. 4 \n\nThe eagle was connected with rites of calling down "fire from \nheaven," probably with a burning-glass, to consume sacrifices on the \naltar. Such "fire from heaven" came down from Yahweh to consume \nthe sons of Aaron (Leviticus 10:2), who died like sacrificial victims to \nthe solar gods of Tyre. Such victims "passed through the fire" as \nofferings, and rose to heaven in the form of eagles. \n\nWe must bear in mind that in the East, whence all these beliefs and cults \nderive, not only was fire regarded as an all-powerful purifying agent, \nbut death by fire was looked upon as an apotheosis which raised the victim \nto the rank of the gods. . . . "Fire, "says Iamblichus, "destroys the \nmaterial part of sacrifices, it purifies all things that are brought near it, \nreleasing them from the bonds of matter and, in virtue of the purity of \nits nature, making them meet for communion with the gods. So, too, it \nreleases us from bondage of corruption, it likens us to the gods. 5 \n\nThe eagle was often identified with the fire bird or phoenix, \nwho underwent a baptism of the fire that "burns all sins" and was \nreborn from his own ashes. The eagle also stood for the soul of \nHeracles, who passed through fire into heaven at seasonal festivals of \nTarsus, and inspired St. Paul\'s belief in the virtue of giving one\'s \nbody to be burned (1 Corinthians 13:3). The eagle was the totemic \nform of Prometheus, who "stole" fire from heaven, like the eastern \nfire-lightning-sun hero, man, or angel embodied in the Garuda bird. \nGaruda flew to the mountain of paradise to steal the gods\' secret of \nimmortality. Later, he assumed the golden body of the sun. American \nIndians had a similar hero, the thunderbird or lightning bird. 6 \n\nAs the royal bird of Rome, and the embodiment of deified \nemperors, the eagle was worshipped by Roman legionaries. Each \nlegion had its sacred eagles, carried into battle like banners. If a legion \nshould lose its eagles, the disgrace was unbearable; another whole \nexpedition might be mounted to recover them. 7 \n\n\n\n262 \n\n\n\nThe Roman imperial emblem was inherited by the Germanic E-Anna \n\n"Holy Roman Empire" and its Kaisers, derived from Caesars. Thus Earth \n\nthe eagle became a Teutonic symbol of sovereignty. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nl.Reinach,90. 2. Strong, 182. 3. Campbell, Oc.M., 334. 4. Strong 187 \n5. Strong, 194. 6. Hallet, 376. 7. Tacitus, 41. \n\n\n\nE-Anna \n\n"Land of Anna," one of the territories of Babylon, named after the \nGoddess under one of her most common Mesopotamian names (see \nAnne, Saint). \n\n\n\nEarth \n\nHerodotus said, "Three different names have been given to the \nearth, which is but one, and those derived from the names of women." \' \nHerodotus miscounted. Thousands of feminine names have been \ngiven to the earth. Continents Asia, Africa, Europe were named \nafter manifestations of the Goddess. Countries bore the names of \nfemale ancestors or of other manifestations of the Goddess: Libya, \nLydia, Russia, Anatolia, Latium, Holland, China, Ionia, Akkad, \nChaldea, Scotland (Scotia), Ireland (Eriu, Hera) were but a few. 2 Every \nnation gave its own territory the name of its own Mother Earth. \nTacitus said the tribes of Europe regarded Mother Earth as "the all- \nruling deity, to whom all else is subject and obedient." 3 \n\nMother Earth received universal worship because she was the \nuniversal parent. American Indians still relate how all peoples and \nanimals in the beginning emerged from Earth\'s yonic hole, and "it was \njust like a child being born from its mother. The place of emergence \nis the womb of the earth." Siberian reindeer hunters say the human race \nemerged from a Goddess, whose carved figurines protect the hunter\'s \nhut, when given offerings and prayers: "Help us to keep healthy! Help \nus to kill much game!" 4 \n\nThe central doctrine of Amerindian religion was reincarnation in a \nnew body from Mother Earth\'s womb, the ancient meaning of "born \nagain." A chief named Smohalla spoke of his moral obligations formed \nby this doctrine: \n\nIt is a sin to wound or cut, to tear or scratch our common mother by \nworking at agriculture. You ask me to dig in the earth? Am I to take a \nknife and plunge it into the breast of my mother? But then, when I die, \nshe will not gather me again into her bosom. You tell me to dig up and \ntake away the stones. Must I mutilate her flesh so as to get at her bones? \nThen I can never again enter into her body and be born again. 5 \n\nOriental Indians had much the same idea about entering the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n263 \n\n\n\nEarth earth. Hindu priests told a dead man: "Go, seek the earth, that wise and \n\nkind mother of all. O Earth, rise up and do not hurt his bones; be \n\n^^^^^^^^m kind and gentle to him. O Earth, cover him as a mother covers her \ninfant with the skirts of her garment." 6 \n\nAncient Roman philosophers had the same idea too. "The Earth \nMother is the mysterious power that awakes everything to life. ... All \ncomes from the earth and all ends in the earth ... the earth produces all \nthings and then enfolds them again . . . the Goddess is the beginning \nand end of all life." A Roman writer of the 3rd century a.d. prayed to \n"Holy Goddess Earth, Nature\'s mother, who bringeth all to life, and \nrevives all from day to day. The food of life Thou grantest in eternal \nfidelity. And when the soul hath retired we take refuge in Thee. All \nthat Thou grantest falls back somewhere into Thy womb." 7 \n\nPatriarchal Christians might have been expected to speak of Father \nHeaven rather than Mother Earth, yet even they found it impossible \nto give up the older deity. The epitaph of Pope Gregory the Great said: \nSuscipe Terra tuo de corpore sumptum: "Receive, O Earth, what \nwas taken from thy body." 8 Even up to the 20th century, tombstones of \nGerman Christians bore the formula: Hier ruht im Mutterschoss der \nErde . . . , "Here rests in Earth\'s maternal womb. . . ." 9 In Chaucer\'s \nPardoner\'s Tale an old man pleaded with the Goddess: \n\n. . . / walk alone and wait \nAbout the earth, which is my mother\'s gate, \nKnock-knocking with my staff from night to noon \nAnd crying, "Mother, open to me soon! \nLook at me, Mother, won \'tyou Jet me in? \nSee how I wither, flesh and bones and skin! \nAlas! When will these bones be laid to rest?" 10 \n\nThis was more than a poetic metaphor. As late as the 1 2th \ncentury, many Europeans still recognized Mother Earth as a Goddess, \nperhaps their only supreme divinity. She was described in an English \nherbal of the period with no mention of God at all: \n\nEarth, divine goddess, Mother Nature, who dost generate all things and \nbringest forth ever anew the sun which thou hast given to the nations; \nGuardian of sky and sea and of all Gods and powers; through thy \ninfluence all nature is hushed and sinks to sleep. . . . Again, when it \npleases thee, thou sendest forth the glad daylight and nurturest life with \nthine eternal surety; and when the spirit of man passes, to thee it \nreturns. Thou art indeed rightly named Great Mother of the Gods; \nVictory is thy divine name. Thou art the source of the strength of \npeoples and gods; without thee nothing can either be born or made \nperfect; thou art mighty, Queen of the Gods. Goddess, I adore thee as \ndivine, I invoke thy name; vouchsafe to grant that which I ask of thee, so \nshall I return thanks to thy godhead. " \n\nUp to the Renaissance, English farmers continued to call upon \nErce, eorthan modor (Earth, mother of earth) when planting. 12 Similar- \n\n\n\n264 \n\n\n\nly, up to the 20th century, Russian farmers continued to call upon Earth \n\nMati-Syra-Zemlya (Moist Mother Earth) for almost everything. Instead \n\nof touching a Bible when taking an oath, a Russian peasant would put ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\na clod of earth on his head, invoking the Mother\'s curse if he broke his \nword. 13 This perpetuated an ancient Greek habit. Even the patriar- \nchal Olympian gods swore their binding oaths by Mother Earth: Gaea, \nor Rhea, called Universal Mother, Deep-Breasted One, firmly \nfounded, oldest of divinities. 13 Hesiod admitted that she ruled Olympus \nbefore the coming of the Hellenic deities. She ruled Russia too. The \ncountry bore her ancient name, Rha (Rhea), the Red One, mother of \nthe Volga and all its tribes. 14 \n\nHome and Mother were literally identical to people who combined \nboth in their image of the earth-goddess. Many believed they must be \nburied in the same soil that supported them in childhood. Threatened \nby invaders, the matriarchal Cimmerians could have saved them- \nselves by moving away from their homeland; but they chose to face \nsuperior numbers of enemies, and die where they were, believing \ntheir lives valueless if they couldn\'t re-unite with the same Earth that \ngave them birth. 15 The Egyptian traveler Sinuhe felt the approach of \ndeath and hurried home to his motherland "to follow the Lady of All," \nhoping that she would "spend eternity by my side." 16 \n\nPost-mortem reunion with the Mother always overlapped with \nthe idea of marrying her. Man seldom distinguished clearly between his \nthree roles as the Goddess\'s child, corpse, and bridegroom. Balkan \npeasants still view death as a sacred marriage, and dress corpses as for a \nwedding. Formal dirges say: "The black earth for my wife I took." \nAncient Greek epitaphs similarly proclaimed the dead man "admitted to \nthe bridal chamber of Persephone." Artemidorus wrote: "All the \naccompaniments of marriage are exactly the same as those of death." 17 \n\nThe archetypal image of the marriage-with-Earth had a curious \nrevival in the special mid- Victorian pornography known as pornoto- \npia, in which the female body was a landscape, and man \ncorrespondingly reduced in fantasy to about the size of a fly: \n\nIn the middle distance there looms a large irregular shape. On the horizon \nswell two immense snowy white hillocks; these are capped by great, \npink, and as it were prehensile peaks or tips as if the rosy-fingered dawn \nitself were playing just behind them. The landscape undulates gently \ndown to a broad, smooth, swelling plain, its soft rolling curves broken only \nin the lower center by a small volcanic crater or omphalos. Farther \ndown, the scene narrows and changes in perspective. Off to the right and \nleft jut two smooth snowy ridges. Between them, at their point of \njuncture, is a dark wood . . . sometimes it is called a thicket . . . triangular \nin shape. It is also like a cedarn cover, and in its midst is a dark romantic \nchasm. In this chasm the wonders of nature abound. From its top there \ndepends a large, pink stalactite, which changes shape, size, and color in \naccord with the movement of the tides below and within. Within the \nchasm which is roughly pear-shaped there are caverns measureless \n\n\n\n265 \n\n\n\nEarth to man, grottoes, hermits\' caves, underground streams a whole internal \n\nand subterranean landscape. The climate is warm but wet. Thunder- \n\n^^__^^___^^^^_ storms are frequent in this region, as are tremors and quakings of the \n\nearth. The walls of the cavern often heave and contract in rhythmic \nviolence, and when they do the salty streams that run through it double \ntheir flow. The whole place is dark yet visible.
