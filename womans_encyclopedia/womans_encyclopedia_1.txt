'Sacred alphabets of the ancient world signified birth and beginning by \nthe letter A. This letter meant the Creatress, who invented alphabets \nand gave them to mankind though most traditions said womankind \nhad them first. \n\nBabylonians called the Great Mother "A", the Beginning; or Aya, \nthe Mother of All Things. 1 Tantric sages called her birth-letter Alpa \nAkshara, "the letter A, which is considered the \'mother of all wisdom,\' \nand therefore of all men of genius; all Bodhisattvas and Buddhas are \nsaid to have been produced by \'A\'." 2 \n\nThe Greeks held similar views about the letter Alpha, which de- \nnoted the river of birth or creation. Its other name was Styx, the river \nof death, for in the cyclic system of the ancients, birth and death merged \nin a circular continuum. The river Styx circled seven times through \nthe earth\'s womb and emerged again as Alpha. \n\nX.Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 133-34. 2. Waddell, 161. \n\n\n\nAb \n\nEgyptian word for the heart-soul, most important of the seven souls: \nthe one that would be "weighed in the balances" by the Goddess Maat \nin the underworld Hall of Judgment after death. As in India, the \nheart-soul was pictured as a tiny dancer treading a constant rhythm in \nthe midst of the body, as Dancing Shiva or Dancing Kali kept the \nrhythm of life in the midst of the cosmos. The hieroglyphic sign of the \nab was a dancing figure. 1 See Heart. \n\n1. Budge, E.L., 44. \n\n\n\nvar. Abaton \n\n\n\nAbaddon \n\nThe god Apollo was a solar king in heaven during the day, and a \nLord of Death in the underworld at night. His latter form became the \nJewish Apollyon, Spirit of the Pit (Revelation 9:1 1). Apollo-Python \nwas the serpent deity in the Pit of the Delphic oracle, who inspired the \nseeress with mystic vapors from his nether world. The Greek word \nfor the Pit was abaton, which the Jews corrupted into Abaddon later a \nfamiliar Christian synonym for hell. \n\nAlso called a mundus or earth-womb, the abaton was a real pit, \nstandard equipment in a pagan temple. Those who entered it to \n"incubate," or to sleep overnight in magical imitation of the incubatory \nsleep in the womb, were thought to be visited by an "incubus" or \nspirit who brought prophetic dreams. 1 Novice priests went down into \nthe pit for longer periods of incubation, pantomiming death, burial, \nand rebirth from the womb of Mother Earth. Once initiated in this way, \nthey were thought to gain the skill of oneiromancy: the ability to \ninterpret dreams. \n\n\n\nThe Old Testament Joseph earned his oneiromantic talent by Abishag \n\nincubation in a Pit. The "brothers" who put him there seem to have \n\nbeen fellow priests. He could interpret Pharaoh\'s dreams only after he ^ \n\nhad submitted to the ritual. Assyrian priests derived similar powers \nfrom a sojourn in the Pit. 2 They then assumed the priestly coat of many \ncolors, signifying communion with the Goddess under her \noneiromantic name of Nanshe, "Interpreter of Dreams." 5 It seems \nlikely that Joseph\'s coat of many colors would have been given him \noriginally not before the initiation but afterward, by a "father" who was \nactually the high priest. 4 \n\nThe same burial-and-resurrection ritual is found in the lives of \nmany ancient sages. It was said of the Pythagorean philosopher \nThales of Miletus, accounted one of the Seven Wise Men of the \nancient world, that he derived his intellectual skills from communion \nwith the Goddess of Wisdom in an abaton. 5 \n\n1.

Larousse, 63. \n5. de Lys, 336. \n\n\n\nAbishag \n\nThe Bible claims the maiden Abishag was chosen for her beauty, to \nengender "heat" in the aged King David (1 Kings 1:2). This "heat" \nwas not mere warmth, but the sacred fire of sexual potency, without \nwhich no king could be allowed to rule. If an impotent king were kept in \noffice, his land would become barren. Hence, when David failed to \n"know" Abishag, a more virile prince (Adonijah) immediately prepared \nto assume the throne, and "exalted himself, saying, I will be king" \n(I Kings 1:5). David\'s death occurred with suggestive promptness after \nhis failure of the virility test. \n\nAbishag\'s name might be related to the Hindu abhiseka ceremony, \nthe anointing of kings with the sacred fluid of the Goddess Sarasvati. 1 \nFrom China to the Mediterranean, ancient kings derived their \nlegitimation from a mating with the Goddess through her priestess- \nsurrogate. 2 Mesopotamian kings and their deified souls, the gods, \nwere constantly described as "beloved" of the Goddess known as \ncreatress of the earth and "maker of fate, she who decrees the fate of \nthe men and gods." 5 Like the eastern Goddess, Abishag represented the \nland in the same way as Solomon\'s bride, whose mating was \nchronicled in the requisite intimate detail by the Song of Solomon. \n\nAfter David\'s death, the queen mother chose between rival candi- \ndates Solomon and Adonijah. She crowned Solomon with her own \nhands (Song of Solomon 3:11), after the custom of the royal women \nwhose business it was to enthrone or depose kings, as in India, Egypt, \nand the lands of the Fertile Crescent. 4 However, Adonijah still had \ndesigns on the throne, as shown by his request for the hand of \nAbishag in marriage. To prevent this symbolically and politically signifi- \ncant marriage from taking place, Solomon had Adonijah murdered \n\n\n\nAbortion (1 Kings 2:17-25). The Bible fails to explain Solomon\'s strangely \n\nviolent reaction to Adonijah\'s request; but it can only have meant that \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ the crown was at stake. This in turn shows that a sexual union with \n\nAbishag was a prerequisite for royal office. See Kingship. \n\n1. Gaster, 514. 2. Boulding, 191. 3. Pritchard, A.N.E. 1, 65; 2, 17, 21, 135, 202. \n4.Boulding,210. \n\n\n\nAbortion \n\nThe ancients generally viewed abortion as a woman\'s private busi- \nness, in which no man had any right to interfere. As Hartley put it, \n"Each woman must be free to make her own choice; no man may \nsafely decide for her; she must give life gladly to be able to give it well." 1 \nBut with the rise of patriarchal religions especially among the \nGreeks came a belief that a father\'s semen conveyed the soul to the \nfetus. Men feared for the safety of any of their body effluvia (hair \ncuttings, fingernail clippings, spittle, blood) lest sorcery might damage \nthe living man by damaging what was once a part of him. The fear \nwas particularly pronounced in the case of semen as an extension of the \nfather\'s soul. If the fetus he conceived were destroyed, then surely the \nman himself would suffer spiritual injury according to the principles of \nmagic. St. Thomas Aquinas held this same opinion, since he asserted \nthat semen was the vehicle of souls. 2 It was a logical extension of this \nnotion that abortion should be outlawed, not because it was danger- \nous to women, but because it was thought (magically) dangerous to \nmen. \n\nIn the east, however, abortion was perfectly legal at any time \nbefore the fifth month, when "quickening" was felt. After that, \naccording to Brahman scriptures, a woman who destroyed her fetus was \nheld guilty of murder, but before that time the fetus was soulless and \ncould be destroyed with impunity. 3 This opinion was embodied in the \nCatholic church\'s Doctrine of Passive Conception, which contradict- \ned Aquinas in order to prove that the soul comes only from God. Up to \nthe late 19th century, the Doctrine of Passive Conception declared \nthat the soul arrives in the fifth month of pregnancy, to quicken the \nfetus, which was previously soulless. 4 \n\nIn 1 869 the church again revised its opinion, tacitly admitting \neither that God had misinformed his church about his method of \ninstilling the soul into the body, or else that he had decided to alter it. \nPope Pius X announced that the soul was received at conception \nafter all. 5 \n\nActually, the church was only coming around, several decades late, \nto follow some new laws made by man, not by God. Abortion was \nnot classified as a crime in Europe until the 19th century. 6 The United \nStates first defined abortion as a criminal offense in the year 1830. 7 \n\nThe church now falsely pretends that it officially "always" opposed \nabortion. The medieval church\'s ire was aroused not by abortions per \n\n\n\nse but by the midwives who performed them. The handbook of the Abraham \n\nInquisition stated: "No one does more harm to the Catholic faith \n\nthan midwives." 8 (See Midwifery.) The church was not averse to ^^^^^^^^ \n\nkilling the unborn, since it burned many pregnant women as witches. \n\nEven the pregnant wife of a city councillor was tortured and burned at \n\nBamberg in 1630. 9 \n\nRecent opposition to legalization of abortion apparently stemmed \nfrom ignorance of how recently it was illegalized; and also from male \nbelief that women must be controlled by forcing childbirth on them. \n"Male legislators have laughed at the idea of the legalization of abor- \ntion, hinting at unprecedented promiscuity (on the part of women, not \nmen) if such a thing were allowed. Meanwhile, thousands of desper- \nate women die each year as the direct result of male laws making \nabortion illegal. Women are learning the meaning of this male \nlaughter and indifference in the face of the most hazardous and serious \nbiological enterprise women undertake, willingly or not." 10 \n\nThe Catholic church still claims authority over women\'s repro- \nductive functions. Catholic hospitals will refuse to abort even a fetus \nconceived by rape. 11 \n\nI. Hartley, 263. 2. Rees, 277. 3. Mahanirvanatantra, 269. 4. Briffault 2, 450. \n\n5.

But Islamic legends say Abraham was a \nlate intruder into the shrine of the Kaaba. He bought it from priestesses \nof its original Goddess. 1 Sarah, "the Queen," was one of the God- \ndess\'s titles, which became a name of Abraham\'s biblical "wife." 2 Old \nTestament writers pretended Sarah\'s alliances with Egyptian princes \nwere only love-affairs arranged by Abraham for his own profit which \nunfortunately presented him as a pimp (Genesis 12:16) as well as a \nwould-be murderer of his son (Genesis 22:10). \n\nIn the tale of Isaac\'s near-killing, Abraham assumed the role of \nsacrificial priest in the druidic style, to wash Jehovah\'s sacred trees \nwith the Blood of the Son: an ancient custom, of which the sacrifice of \nJesus was only a late variant. Jehovah first appeared to Abraham at \nthe sacred oak of Shechem, where Abraham built his altar. Later \nAbraham built an altar to the oak god of Mamre at Hebron. Even in \nthe 4th century a.d., Constantine said Abraham\'s home at the Oak of \nMamre was still a pagan shrine: "It is reported that most damnable \nidols are set up beside it, and that an altar stands hard by, and that \nunclean sacrifices are constantly offered." 3 \n\n1.

Abrasax \n\n\n\nAbraxas \n\nGnostic god identified with both Mithra and Jehovah, called "Our \nFather" and "Lord of Hosts" in the early Christian era. 1 Like Mithra, \nAbraxas represented "the 365 Aeons," 365,000 years allotted to the \npresent world\'s life span, based on the Hindu idea that one god- \nyear equals a thousand man-years. Jewish scripturists incorporated this \nbelief into Psalms 90:4, and into the First Book of Adam and Eve, \nwhere God said his five and a half days meant 5,500 years for man. 2 \nNumerical values of Mithra\'s and Abraxas\'s names each totaled 365. \nBoth were gods of numerology. \n\nOrthodox Christianity came to view Abraxas as a demon, because \nhe was assimilated to the Gnostic "Lord of This World" whose \nattributes were both divine and demonic. As the Creator of the material \nuniverse, he was declared a devil via the Gnostic opinion that all \nmatter was evil. Thus, he and his works the material world itself \nwould be destroyed at doomsday. 5 Nevertheless, through the Middle \nAges Abraxas was a favorite deity of several heretical sects. \n\n1. Budge, AT., 209. 2. Forgotten Books, 6. 3. Legge 2, 239. \n\n\n\nAbsalom \n\nThe Bible presents Absalom as either David\'s son or David\'s neigh- \nbor (2 Samuel 12:1 1) because biblical writers couldn\'t decide just where \nhe came from. He was important only as a surrogate "king" of the \nJews. His name, Father Salm, was a widely distributed sacred-king \nname, also rendered Salma, Salem, Salomon, or Solomon; in Assyria, \nShalmaneser; in Crete, the "son of God" Salmoneus. 1 The name \nmeant Prince of Peace, which was synonymous with Lord of Death \nbecause "Peace" was the Lord\'s word of farewell as he descended into \nthe underworld. \n\nCanaanites worshipped Father Salm at the city of Salem, whose \nPalestinian counterpart was Jeru-salem, "House of Salem." Kings of \nDavid\'s ancestral tribe, the Kenites, took the sacred name when ruling \nin Jerusalem. Probably several of these kings were called Solomon, \nincluding the biblical one whose real name was Jedidiah, according to 2 \nSamuel 12:25. \n\nAbsalom received the sacred name and died as a surrogate for the \nincumbent king, David, whose mourning for him was really a \nliturgical formula. He called Absalom "my son, my son," and cried \n"Would God I had died for thee" to disguise the fact that the victim \nreally had died in his place. Among ancient Semites generally, someone \nhad to die for the king at regular intervals, to preserve the fertility of \nthe soil and the people with his blood. See Kingship. \n\nTime-honored precedent dictated the format of the drama. The \nchosen victim sat on the throne, and publicly copulated with the royal \nwomen under a marriage canopy (2 Samuel 16:22). See Huppah. \n\n\n\nAfter this, Absalom was declared a god and his phallic spirit was Abtu \n\nimmortalized by an erect pillar (2 Samuel 1 8: 1 8). He was hung on a Achilles \n\nsacred oak "between heaven and earth," like all victims offered to ^^^^^^^^^ m \n\ndeities of the air and sky. 2 He was pierced through the heart by three \ndarts, like the Egyptian god Set. He was dismembered by ten men in \npriests\' livery (2 Samuel 18:14-1 5). According to the old custom, pieces \nof him were then distributed to the fields and vineyards to encourage \nthe growth of crops. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 363-64. 2. Angus, 173. \n\n\n\nAbtu \n\nThe "Abyss," sometimes called Fish of Isis, representing her genital \norifice, which "swallowed" the penis of Osiris. Abtu was the Egyptian \nname of Abydos, an early yonic shrine where the god died and \nentered his Mother\'s womb, the underworld. See Fish. \n\n\n\nAcedia \n\n"Abysmal apathy," ecclesiastical term for the acute depression afflict- \ning those in the monastic life. 1 They recognized that acedia \nmade monks and nuns especially susceptible to demonic possession. \nSee Possession. \n\n1. Mumford, 302. \n\n\n\nAchamoth \n\nMother Goddess who gave birth to the creator of the material uni- \nverse, according to early Gnostic Christians. 1 She was the third \nperson of a primordial female trinity consisting of Sige, Sophia, \nand Achamoth comparable to northern Europeans\' divine Great- \nGrandmother, Grandmother, and Mother. 2 The three of them \nchastised the male creator for excessive hubris and other offenses. \nSee Sophia, Saint. \n\n1. Legge 2, 69. 2. Turville-Petre, 147. \n\n\n\nAchilles \n\nHomeric hero of the Iliad, greatest of the Greek warriors at the siege \nof Troy. Achilles was a son of the Sea-goddess, here called Thetis, "She \nWho Disposes." Most of his body was invulnerable because his \nmother dipped him in the holy river Styx when he was an infant; but \nthe spot on his heel, where her fingers held him, was not exposed to \n\n\n\nAciel the magical waters. Therefore he could be, and was, killed by an arrow \n\nAdam in his heel, as was the Hindu Krishna. Hence any area of vulnerability \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ in an otherwise strong structure or person is known as an Achilles Heel. \n\nLike Heracles, Achilles lived for some time in female disguise, \nrecalling the priesthoods of Homeric and pre-Homeric times who \nwore women\'s clothing to attain the powers of divinity. \n\n\n\nAciel \n\nBlack Sun of the Chaldean underworld; the god of darkness at the \nbottom of the sevenfold Pit, exactly mirroring the gods of light at the top \nof the seventh heaven. Most underground gods and Lords of Death \nwere similar to Aciel Hades, Pluto, Saturn, Ahriman, Apollyon, \nPython, Zeus Chthonios, and their later composite, the Judeo-Christian \ndevil. Jewish writers made Aciel a "prince of Gehenna" and corrupted \nhis name to Arsiel. 1 He was not always devilish or evil. Oriental religions \ngenerally recognized that a principle of darkness was necessary to life, for \nonly in the nether darkness could regeneration take place. \n1.

They lied to the man, telling him the magic food of \neternal life would kill him if he ate it. So he refused it and lost his \nchance to escape death forevermore. 1 \n\nThe biblical God also showed concern lest human beings should \neat the food of eternal life (Genesis 3:22). God told Adam the same \nlie that the Babylonian god told Adamu: "Thou shalt not eat of it: for in \nthe day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Genesis 2:17). \nAdam ate, but he didn\'t die in the same day. On the contrary, he lived \nto the age of 930 years (Genesis 5:5). It was the serpent who told the \ntruth about the controversial food: "Ye shall not surely die; for God \ndoth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be \nopened, and ye shall be as gods" (Genesis 3:4-5). \n\nl.Hooke.M.E.M., 57-58. \n\n\n\nAdelphos \n\nGreek word for "brother," dating back to the matriarchal period \nwhen kinship was reckoned only through a mother.

In Jerusalem, his name was Tammuz. \n\nAdonis was born at Bethlehem, in the same sacred cave that \nChristians later claimed as the birthplace of Jesus. 1 He was the son of \nthe Virgin Myrrha, a temple-woman or hierodule, identified with Mary \nby early Christians who called Jesus\'s mother Myrrh of the Sea. 2 \nMyrrh was a symbol of the Lord\'s death, in both pagan and Christian \ntraditions. He returned to his Great Mother, the sea, Aphrodite-Mari. \nAlexandrian priestesses celebrated the event by throwing the god\'s \nimage into the sea. 3 \n\nSyrian Adonis died at Easter time, with the flowering of the red \nanemone, supposedly created from his blood. Its name was derived \nfrom his title, Naaman, "darling." He was also called the Beautiful God, \nlike other gods of the spring flowering, such as Narcissus, Antheus, \nHyacinthus. \n\nAnother form of the same god was Anchises, castrated after his \nmating with Aphrodite. Adonis, too, was castrated: "gored in the \ngroin" by Aphrodite\'s boar-masked priest. His severed phallus became \nhis "son," the ithyphallic god Priapus, identified with Eros in Greece \nor Osiris-Min in Egypt. Priapus carried a pruning knife in token of the \nLord\'s necessary castration before new life could appear on earth. 4 \n\nCastrating the god was likened to reaping the grain, which Adonis \npersonified. His rebirth was a sprouting from the womb of the earth. \nEach year, sacred pots called kernos or "gardens of Adonis" were \nplanted with wheat or millet, and allowed to sprout at Easter. The \ncustom was followed in Mediterranean countries up to the present \ncentury. 5 The clay pot signified the womb. Sometimes in processions \nit was a gigantic kernos carried on a chariot, having the special name \nof kalanthos. 6 \n\nAdonis died and rose again in periodic cycles, like all gods of \nvegetation and fertility. He was also identified with the sun that died \nand rose again in heaven. An Orphic hymn said of him: "Thou shining \nand vanishing in the beauteous circle of the Horae, dwelling at one \ntime in gloomy Tartarus, at another elevating thyself to Olympus, \ngiving ripeness to fruits." 7 He was buried in the same cave (womb) \nthat gave him birth. It is now the Milk Grotto, whose dust is supposed to \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\n\nbenefit nursing mothers; it was said Mary nursed Jesus there. 8 The Adultery \n\nGrotto was sealed as Jesus\'s sepulchre, for in the cults of both Jesus and Aeneas \n\nAdonis the virgin womb was the same as the virgin tomb, "wherein ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nnever man before was laid" (Luke 23:53). \n\nThe Magic Papyri said Jesus and Adonis also shared the same \nname-magic. "Adonai" was the highest god, having the True Name \nthat could work miracles. 9 Centuries later, Christian authorities declared \nthat "Adonai" was a demon. \n\n1. Doane, 155; Briffault 3, 97. 2.

Patriarchal societies therefore sought to insure \nwives\' sexual fidelity for economic reasons. 2 \n\nTo this end, the Bible commands stoning to death an adulterous \nwife or a bride suspected of oremarital affairs (Deuteronomy 22:21). \nThe latter rule was to invalicate the pagan custom of premarital \ndefloration by a stranger, lest someone other than the husband might \nhave a claim on the bride\'s property. 5 Hebrew patriarchs also considered \n"adulterous" a widow who might remarry "unto a stranger" outside \nthe paternal clan. Widows were ordered to marry the brother of a \ndeceased husband, so their property would remain under the control \nof male in-laws. This law of Levirate Marriage with its apparently divine \nsanction caused much trouble in later centuries. \n\n1. Brasch, 125. 2. Hartley, 165, 171. 3.

By the 7th century a.d. the agape ceremony was \ndeclared heretical, but it continued secretly throughout the Middle \nAges. 2 See Menstrual Blood. \n\n1. Attwater, 34. 2. Sadock, Kaplan & Freedman, 23. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\n\nAgatha, Saint Agatha, Saint \n\n"Kindly One," a spurious saint based on images of the lactating A gnes, Saint \n\nGoddess offering bared breasts in the usual Ishtar pose. As a fictitious p \n\n"virgin martyr," Agatha refused to marry the king of Sicily, who \n\nvengefully ordered her breasts sliced off. Early Christian icons showed \n\nher carrying them on a patera (offering dish) as St. Lucy carried her \n\neyeballs. 1 Later, the amputated breasts were misinterpreted as bells; so \n\nAgatha became patroness of bell founders. 2 Her legend may have \n\narisen from the Christian habit of knockingthe breasts off statues of \n\npriestesses and Goddesses. 3 \n\nThe original Agatha was surnamed Tyche (Fate), and worshipped \nat the subterranean womb-oracle of Trophonios at Lebadeia. 4 Like \nthe Goddess of the similar womb-oracle at Delphi, she was accompa- \nnied by a Great Serpent: the oracular spirit named Agathodemon, \ngod of Kindly Fortune, worshipped by Orphic sects up to the 5th and \n6th centuries a.d. Far from tormenting Agatha as her Christian \nlegend claimed, Sicilian kings won their thrones by way of a sacred \nmarriage with her. Many of these kings took the name of Agathocles, \n"Glory of Agatha," just as Heracles called himself "Glory of Hera." 5 \n\nThe Golden Legend conferred on St. Agatha the curious title of \nSavior of Her Country, saying "She accomplished the deliverance of \nher native land." 6 This probably referred to votive images of the \nGoddess which were supposed to preserve the land from all external \ndangers. \n\n1.

However, her true nature as an orgiastic priestess- \nheroine might be guessed from her ineradicable connections with \nlove and marriage. A priest became her bridegroom by placing a \nwedding ring on the finger of her statue, as if it were the statue of \nAphrodite-Galatea. 3 Bollandus\'s Acts of the Saints said Agnes founded \nher nunnery in a house of sacred prostitutes, like priestesses of \nAphrodite-Salacia. 4 All the way up to the present century, St. Agnes\'s \nEve was the traditional time for girls to divine the names of their \nfuture lovers by means of magic mirrors. 5 \n\n13 \n\n\n\nAgni Unfortunately for St. Agnes\'s credibility, she is said to have suf- \n\nAhriman fered in the reign of Constantine when Christians were not \n\n^ wmgn persecuted. It was also falsely claimed that Agnes cured Constantine\'s \ndaughter of leprosy. Roman Jews were said to have worshipped her in \na church on the Via Nomentana, built in her honor in 350 a.d.; but \nRoman Jews didn\'t worship Christian saints, and no churches were \nbuilt in honor of female martyrs in 350 a.d. 6 Roman Jews probably did, \nhowever, worship at least one version of Agna the Holy Lamb. \n\nThough Catholic scholars now say Agnes\'s legends have been \nfound "disappointingly" devoid of truth, her relics are still preserved \nin Rome and constantly adored by the faithful. 7 \n\n1.

She represented the primal ocean of blood from which all \nthings arose at creation; he represented the fructifying fire from \nheaven (lightning); their combination meant vital heat. Vedic sages said \nthe soul of all the universe, moving and still, is made of a combination \nof blood and fire. Agni also appeared to consume sacrifices that were \nburned on their altars. He was a prototype of such Indo-European \nfire-bringers as Lucifer, Prometheus, Etana, Hephaestus, and Heracles. 1 \n1.0\'Flaherty,97, 148,339. \n\n\n\nAhriman \n\nGreat Serpent, Lord of Darkness, and rival of the sun god in Persian \nmyth; leader of the daevas, whom Zoroastrians called devils, though the \noriginal Indo-Iranian word meant "gods." 1 (See Serpent.) \n\nThe story of Ahriman\'s revolt against his twin brother, the Heav- \nenly Father, of their war in heaven, and of the daevas\'faW to the \nunderworld, gave western Europe its basic myth of the fall of Lucifer, \nand its dualistic division of the universe between forces of good and \nevil. Persian prophets predicted the defeat of Ahriman and his dark \nangels during the final battle at the end of the world, and Judeo- \nChristian prophets adopted the same idea. As the Serpent, Ahriman also \ntempted the first man and woman. \n\nBut Ahriman was not considered inferior to the Heavenly Father. \nOn the contrary, they were twins, born simultaneously from the \nwomb of the primal Crone of Time (Zurvan). Ahriman\'s influence on \nearth was greater than his celestial brother\'s, because he created the \nmaterial world. Persian Magi regarded him as the source of their magic \npower, and offered sacrifices to him. Mithraic shrines from Budapest \n\n\n\n14 \n\n\n\nto York were dedicated to "Arimanius" as the underground god of \nmagic arts. 2 \n\nAhriman was not originally Persian. He was the Vedic god \nAryaman, maker of "Aryans" the people he created of clay. \nAryaman was one of the twelve zodiacal sons of the Goddess Aditi. 3 \nHe also had a Celtic incarnation, as the divine king Eremon. \n\nl.Lamusse, 317. 2.

O\'Flaherty, 339. \n\n\n\nAhura Mazda \nAkka \n\n\n\nAhura Mazda \n\nPersian sun god born as the twin brother of the dark god Ahriman \nfrom the womb of Infinite Time, the Primal Creatress. The fight \nbetween the brothers, resulting in Ahriman\'s fall from heaven, had \nthe same cause as the rivalry between Cain and Abel that is, the \nsacrificial offering of one was accepted by the older deity; that of the \nother was rejected. The older deity was Vayu, probably a derivative of \nthe Vedic celestial androgyne Varuna, or Mitra-Varuna, whose other \nname became "Mithra". \n\nThe story of the battle and the fall might have been a revision of \nthe ancient creation myth concerning the Goddess\'s punishment of \nher first-created serpent-consort for his hubris. 1 The name Ahura was \nonce a feminine name. 2 \n\nMiddle Persian forms of the name were Ormazd, Ormizd, or \nHormizd. These names were commonly taken by kings who embod- \nied the god\'s solar spirit, especially kings of the Iranian Sassanian \ndynasty. 3 Being naturally deified after death, such kings had cult \ncenters and groups of priests who kept up their worship. One of these \napparently became converted to Christianity and contributed another \napocryphal saint to the Christian canon, usually misspelled "St. Hor- \nmidz," though Hormizd was obviously meant. This saint was vaguely \nplaced in the 5th century a.d. and declared a Persian martyr, though his \nlegend lacked every kind of foundation, even that of common sense. \nIt was claimed that, for a refusal to renounce Christianity, St. Hormidz \nwas condemned to serve as a military camel-driver which may not \nhave been precisely a life of luxury, but hardly qualified as martyrdom. 4 \nThis sun-god-turned-saint was revered through the early Middle \nAges by cult centers located in Persia and Iraq. \n\n1.

She was the "Water-drawer" who \nbrought gods to birth out of the primal deep the feminine prototype \n\n\n\nvar. Ormazd, \nOrmizd, Hormizd \n\n\n\n15 \n\n\n\nAladdin of Aquarius. A similar Central-American Goddess figure had curiously \n\nsimilar names, Acat or Akna. 1 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Akka had many related names. Greeks called her Acco or Acca, \n\n"She Who Fashions." 2 To Lapps and Finns in northern Europe, she \nwas Mader-Akka Mother Akka who created humanity. 3 To Ro- \nmans, she was Acca Larentia, or Acca the mother of the Lares, which \nwere archaic ancestral spirits left over from pre-Roman Latium. \n\nAcca Larentia was variously called the first Vestal Virgin, or a \ntemple prostitute, or a rich courtesan, or a virgin bride of God roles \nthat may seem mutually contradictory but were not so (see Prostitu- \ntion; Vestal Virgins). As the divine midwife, she helped Rhea Silvia \ngive birth to Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome. She drew the \ndivine twins out of their floating basket on the river Tiber, just as \nAkka of Akkad drew Sargon out of his floating basket on the river Tigris, \nand "Pharaoh\'s daughter" drew Moses from the Nile. \n\nAcca Larentia was honored every year at the Roman festival of the \nLarentalia. She was assimilated to the cult of Heracles, who became \none of her husbands. In his Roman temple, Heracles was mated to \n"Acca, the Maker." 4 \n\n1. Lamusse, 439. 2. Graves, CM. 2, 190. 3.

As the fairy tale said, he was master of a \nsecret cave of treasures, but the cave was real. It was located in the \nfortified valley of Alamut near Kazvin, headquarters of the fanatical \nbrotherhood of hashish im or "hashish-takers," which Christians mis- \npronounced "assassins." \n\nAladdin was an Old Man of the Mountain, hereditary title of the \nchief of hashishim, beginning with a Shi\'ite leader Hasan ibn al- \nSabbah, whose name meant Son of the Goddess (see Arabia). The later \nname of Aladdin was taken by several chieftains. In 1297 the region \nof Gujarat was conquered by a warrior called the Bloody One, \nAla-ud-den. 1 \n\nBy means of drugs and an elaborate "paradise" staffed by human \nHouris, initiates into the brotherhood were persuaded that they died \nand went to heaven, or Fairyland, where gardens and palaces occupied \nthe valley of the secret cave. Special conduits flowed with the Four \nRivers of Paradise: water, wine, milk, and honey. Each candidate was \ndrugged into a stupor, then woke and "perceived himself surrounded \nby lovely damsels, singing, playing, and attracting his regards by the \nmost fascinating caresses, serving him also with delicate foods and \nexquisite wines; until intoxicated with excess of enjoyment amidst actual \n\n\n\n16 \n\n\n\nrivulets of milk and wine, he believed himself assuredly in Paradise, Alako \n\nand felt an unwillingness to relinquish its delights." 2 Alani \n\nAfter this period of bliss, the warrior was again drugged and taken ^^^^^^^^^^ \nout of the secret place, to fight in the service of the Old Man of the \nMountain. He fought fearlessly, in the belief that death in battle would \ninstantly carry him back to that heaven cleverly made real for him. \nPromises of sexual bliss were the real key to the ferocity of Islamic \narmies. The Koran said each hero who died in battle would achieve \nan eternity of pleasure among heavenly Houris with "big, beautiful, \nlustrous eyes." 3 \n\nAladdin\'s sect worshipped the moon as a symbol of the Goddess, \nlike the Vessel of Light associated with both the virgin Mary and the \nHoly Grail in western Europe. 4 Eastern poets said the Vessel of Light \nproduced djinn, "spirits of ancestors." This Vessel was simultaneous- \nly Aladdin\'s lamp, source of djinni (a genie), and the moon, source of all \nsouls according to the most ancient beliefs. The moon was the realm \nof the dead, and also the realm of rebirth since all souls were recycled \nthrough many revolutions of the wheels of Fate. The divine Houris \nalso dwelt in the moon, which probably was the light of Aladdin\'s secret \ncave. See Moon. \n\nThe Arabian Nights gave the password to Aladdin\'s cave: Open, \nSesame. This was related to Egyptian seshemu, "sexual intercourse." \nThe hieroglyphic sign of seshemu was a penis inserted into an arched \nyoni-symbol. 5 Every ancient culture used some form of sexual \nsymbolism for the idea of man-entering-paradise. \n\nl.Zimmer ( 54. 2.

Trigg, 202. \n\n\n\nAlani \n\n"Hunting dogs," Greek name for the Scythian tribes who wor- \nshipped Artemis as their Divine Huntress. The name Alan still carried \nthe original Greek meaning of a hunting dog when it became popular \namong the Scots during the Middle Ages. Artemis was often called the \nGreat Bitch, and her hunting priestesses were the "sacred bitches" \nwho chased, killed, and consumed boar-gods and stag-gods like Phorcis \nor Actaeon. Thus, to Christians, "son of a bitch" meant a devil \nworshipper that is, a pagan devotee of the Goddess. See Dog. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n\n\nAlban, Saint Alban, Saint \n\nAlchemy Fictitious saint called "protomartyr of England," allegedly the first \n\nmmmmtammmatmm Christian martyr in the British isles, slain on Holmhurst Hill in 287 a.d. \nHowever, no writer made any reference to him until two hundred \nyears later. Gildas finally developed St. Alban\'s legend in the 6th \ncentury, with some confusion of dates. He claimed St. Alban shel- \ntered a Christian fleeing from Diocletian\'s persecution, twenty years \nbefore Diocletian\'s persecution began. 1 \n\nThe real origin of St. Alban probably was nothing more than the \nBritish Goddess\'s title of Albion, "White Moon." Her shrine at \nHolmhurst Hill had a sacred fountain, always shown between the feet of \n"Alban" in Christian art. 2 In Bede\'s day the place was still holy, and \nsomeone had to invent a Christianized and preferably masculinized \nlegend for it. \n\nl.Attwater, 37. 2. Brewster, 293. \n\n\n\nAlberich \n\nKing of the underworld in Teutonic myth, identified with the Saxon \nfairy-king Oberon. Alberich appeared in the Nibelungenlied as a chtho- \nnian dwarf master-smith, guardian of the Rhinemaidens\' buried \ntreasure. Like most versions of the demonic fairy king, he was a shape- \nshifter, appearing in such typically diabolic disguises as a toad and a \nserpent. He is still familiar to opera fans as a character in Wagner\'s Ring \nof the Nibelung. \n\n\n\nAlchemy \n\nIn Arabic, alchemy meant "matter of Egypt," Al-Khemeia, from \nKhemennu, "Land of the Moon," an old name for Egypt. 1 The Arabs \nthought alchemy was invented by Egyptians. Christians learned it \nfrom the Arabs and believed it was invented by Thoth, or Hermes, or \nthe virgin Mary. 2 \n\n"Mary the Jewess" was said to have been the first great alchemist. \nShe discovered distillation of alcohol in the time of the Caliphate, and \ninvented the double boiler, still called bain-marie (Mary\'s bath) in \nFrance. During the Renaissance some female alchemists were perse- \ncuted as witches. Julius, Duke of Brunswick, roasted one of them alive \nin an iron chair in 1 575, because she could not tell him how to make \ngold out of base metal. 3 \n\nAs a system of mysticism, alchemy was permeated by sexual \nsymbols. So-called "copulations" and "marriages" figured in alchem- \nical procedures. Sexual drawings enlivened the texts. The Alchemical \nRebus was the usual bisexual image of male and female powers in \nunion, "a Hermaphrodite, born of two mountains, Mercury and \n\n\n\n18 \n\n\n\nVenus." Sun and moon were shown as naked male and female Alchemy \n\nfigures, the moon saying to her spouse, "O Sun, thou dost nothing \n\nalone if I am not present with my strength, as a cock is helpless - - \n\nwithout a hen." 4 \n\nAlchemists sought the divine female power Sapientia, or Sophia \n(Wisdom), the Gnostics\' Great Mother. Valentin\'s L\'Azoth des \nphilosophes showed her as a crowned, fish-tailed Aphrodite rising from \nthe sea, spouting streams of milk and blood from her breasts. This \nwas a direct copy of Hindu representations of the virgin Maya, mother \nof the world. 5 Alchemists called her the Siren of the Philosophers, \n"born of our deep Sea (Maria), who pours milk and blood from her \npaps." 6 \n\nAn Italian manuscript showed two bearded sages avidly sucking \nher breasts, to absorb the secrets symbolized by her colors, milk white \nand blood red. 7 The same colors appeared on the Flower of the \nAlchemists, a five-petaled red-and-white rose, sometimes called the \nwomb of the FiJium philosophorum or Glorious Child. The same rose \nsymbolized the virgin Mary. 8 \n\nMary-Sophia was the Goddess of both Gnosticism and alchemy. \nThe Philosopher\'s Stone was sometimes called the Sophistical \nStone. 9 Alchemical writings called the hidden Goddess the Mother of \nWisdom, combining elements of the Madonna with those of the \npagan mother-image: \n\nlam the flower of the fleldand the lily of the valleys. lam the mother of \nfair love and of fear and of knowledge and of holy hope. . .lam the \nmediator of the elements. . . . lam the law in the priest and the word in \nthe prophet and the counsel in the wise. I will kill and I will make to \nlive and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. 10 \n\nSince the ancient Great Mother was represented by a Holy \nVase, alchemists sought the vas hermeticum (Womb of Hermes), which \nresembled the vas spirituale identified with the virgin Mary. Arab \nalchemists adopted the rosary from Far-Eastern cults of the Goddess, \nwhose rosary-symbol was a vase-shaped bead, from which the other \nbeads were said to "spring up." Rosaries dedicated to Mary also had the \nvase-shaped bead. Arabs called the rosary wardija, "rose-garden," \ncopying the Hindu japamala, "rose-chaplet," the necklace of Kali Ma, \nwho ruled the elements as alchemists also hoped to do. A Diirer \ndrawing of 1 506 shows a turbanned Arab alchemist with his rosary at his \nbelt. 11 \n\nMany alchemical texts presented obvious sexual allegories, e.g. \nfrom the Turba Philosophorum: "Take the white tree, build him a \nround, dark, dew-encircled house, and set in it a hundred-year-old man \nand close it so that no wind or dust can get to him; then leave him \nthere eight days. I tell you that that man will not cease to eat of the fruit \nof that tree till he becomes a youth. O what a wonderful nature, for \nhere is the father become son and born again." 12 \n\nSimilar allegorical references to the mysteries of reproduction were \n\n19 \n\n\n\nAlchemy common among Chinese alchemists, who spoke of attaining "longev- \n\nity through liquid gold," by "a red sulphurous ingredient in \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ goldmaking" the male and female essences in Taoist and Tantric \nsymbolism (see Menstrual Blood). One text said: \n\n/ must diligently plant my own field. There is within it a spiritual germ \nthat may live a thousand years. Its flower is like yellow gold. Its bud is \nnot large, but its seeds are round and like unto a spotless gem [i.e., the \nJewel in the Lotus]. Its growth depends upon the soil of the central \nplace [womb], but its irrigation must proceed from a higher fountain. Alter \nnine years [or, months] of cultivation, root and branch may be trans- \nplanted to the heaven of the higher genii. n \n\nChurchmen were baffled by alchemical language, and usually \nlet practitioners of this particular "devilish art" alone, unless they were \nwomen. Yet the official opposition to the whole science kept many of \nthe best minds away from it, thus helping to retard the development of \nmodern chemistry out of alchemical experimentation. 14 \n\nThe deep secrecy of the alchemists\' operations still puzzles many \nmodern scholars. Carl Jung wondered why these chemical processes \nhad to be disguised and distorted by thickets of mythological symbolism; \nor, if a mystical sort of enlightenment was being described, why it was \ntied to laboratory procedures. 15 The answer could be found in the \nalchemists\' political environment. "Natural science" was often de- \nfined as heresy by the church. In periods when the Inquisition was \nactive, almost anyone meddling with such matters was at risk. The \nbest defense was deliberately obscure allegorization, in which theologi- \ncal principles if any could be hidden. \n\nSome of the secret is given away by the preponderance of sexual \nsymbols in alchemical literature. "Copulation of Athene and Her- \nmes" might mean mixing sulfur and mercury in a retort; or it might \nmean a sexual "working" of the alchemist and his lady-love. Illustra- \ntions in alchemical books suggested sexual mysticism more often than \nnot. Adam and Eve were shown as naked lovers, halves of the Primal \nAndrogyne. Adam was pictured as incomplete male, who had to be \npierced by the Arrow of Mercurius to stimulate his passionate desire \nfor Wisdom. After this, his phallus bloomed into the flowering Tree of \nLife, signifying that he was ready for full union with a Goddess-like \nEve, who would make him complete. 16 \n\nMercurius or Hermes was the alchemical hero who fertilized \nthe Holy Vase, a womb-like sphere or egg from which the films \nphilosophorum was to be born. This vessel may have been real, a \nlaboratory flask or retort; more often, it seemed to be a mystical \nsymbol. 17 The Royal Diadem of its offspring was said to appear in \nmenstruo meretricis, "in the menstrual blood of a whore," who may \nhave been the Great Whore, an ancient epithet of the Goddess. Her \nmenstrual blood curdled in her womb to create the universe, including \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\n\nits metals, minerals, and other raw materials of alchemy. The Rosar- Alchemy \n\nium Phibsophorum (Rosary of the Philosophers) said the soul of the \n\nworld is made of male and female "matters": Anima est Sol et Luna. ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSimilarly a human soul was produced by male and female parents. \n\nSexual mystics held a theory that every individual person or thing had \n\nbut half a soul, which must find its other half in the opposite sex. 18 \n\nAt times the alchemists appeared to be seeking a lost deity, like the \ncabalists\' Shekina: the Mother {mater) sleeping in the material matter \nof the world, having been separated from the God whose other half she \nwas. Alchemists usually rejected the church\'s teaching that matter \nwas "evil" or "fallen." As Gnostic animists they thought the "savior" \ndestined to emerge from the alchemical matrix (mother-womb) was \nboth an anthropomorphic Glorious Child or Hlius macrocosmi, and a \n"miraculous stone" or Philosopher\'s Stone, possessing corpus, anima, \nspiritus, the "redeemer" of the inanimate universe. 19 As an enlightened \nmystic the alchemist hoped to attend the birth of this strange being, \nwho would teach him to transform base metals into gold, as eastern \nyogis were said to do when they were sufficiently enlightened. \n\nOne reason why the church opposed alchemy and identified it \nwith black magic was that many alchemical texts offered greater \nrevelations, more simply achieved, than the Bible or the pulpit could \noffer, and thus took on the character of a rival. For example, the \nAbtala Jurain (1732) presented the whole creation: \n\nTake of common rainwater a good quantity, at least ten quarts; preserve it \nwell sealed in glass vessels for at least ten days, then it will deposit \nmatter and feces on the bottom. Pour off the clear liquid and place it in a \nwooden vessel that is fashioned round like a ball; cut it in the middle \nand Hll the vessel a third full, and set it in the sun about midday in a secret \nor secluded spot. \n\nWhen this has been done, take a drop of the consecrated red wine \nand let it fall into the water, and you will instantly perceive a fog and a \nthick darkness on top of the water, such as also was at the first creation. \nThen put in two drops, and you will see the light coming forth from the \ndarkness; whereupon little by little put in every half of each quarter hour \nfirst three, then four, then live, then six, drops, and no more, and you \nwill see with your own eyes one thing after another appearing by and by \non top of the water, how God created all things in six days, and how it \nall came to pass, and such secrets as are not to be spoken aloud and I also \nhave not power to reveal. Pall on your knees before you undertake this \noperation. Let your eyes judge of it; for thus was the world created. Let all \nstand as it is, and in half an hour after it began it will disappear. \n\nBy this you will see clearly the secrets of God, that are at present \nhidden from you as from a child. You will understand what Moses has \nwritten concerning the creation; you will see what manner of body Adam \nand Eve had before and after the Fall, what the serpent was, what the \ntree, and what manner of fruits they ate; where and what Paradise is, and \nin what bodies the righteous shall be resurrected; not in this body that \n\n\n\n21 \n\n\n\nAlcmene we have received from Adam, but in that which we attain through the \n\nAllah Holy Ghost, namely in such body as our Savior brought from \n\n^^_^^__^_^_ Heaven. 20 \n\n1.

It was houloi in Greek, uluktus in Latin, hulluloo or hulla-baloo \n\nin Old Irish. 1 Herodotus said the "howlings in the temple" were derived \n\nfrom the cult of Athene in Libya, where "the women do it very \n\nwell." 2 \n\nAlleluia was used as a battle cry in the Middle Ages, and credited \nwith powerful victory-magic. The legend of St. Germain describes its \nuse in a battle between Saxons and Britons. As the cry of the god \nPan was supposed to cause "pan-ic" in his enemies, so the sound of \nalleluia was thought to kill the enemy\'s fighting spirit. 3 \n\nl.Hazlitt, 341. 2. Herodotus, 270. 3. de Voragine, 399. \n\n\n\nAlma Mater \n\n"Soul-Mother," a Roman teaching priestess, especially one empow- \nered to give instruction in the sexual Mysteries. (See Cowrie). The \nname was based on Al-Mah, a Middle-Eastern name of the Moon- \ngoddess, also a title of her temple women, almah the same word that \ndescribed the virgin Mary in the Hebrew versions of the Gospels. 1 \nThe priestess called alma materbore a relationship to the male initiate \nsimilar to that of the Tantric Shakti. \n\nl.Brasch, 25. \n\n\n\nAlphabet \n\nSee Motherhood. \n\n\n\nAltar \n\nThe custom of burying relics of saints under an altar began with a \nmisunderstanding of the scripture, "I saw under the altar the souls of \nthem that were slain for the word of God" (Revelation 6:9). This was \nbased on a pagan teaching, that the souls of the enlightened became \nstars in heaven. Those recently deceased stood on the border of the \nsky, under the constellation of the Altar, which lies close to the horizon \nas seen from Mediterranean latitudes. 1 \n\nThe Altar was a feminine constellation because the earliest altars \nwere modeled on the maternal hearth, and altars symbolized the \nMother. The Earth\'s regenerative womb was often represented as an \n\n\n\n23 \n\n\n\nAl-Uzza \nAmazons \n\n\n\naltar, which explains why "witch cults" were said to make an altar of \nthe belly of a living woman. The Heavenly Virgin was also an altar, Ara \nCoeli, "Altar of Heaven," she who received the souls of the dead. \nChristians adopted this symbolism from the virgin Mary. One of the \nNativity legends claimed the Cumaean Sybil showed Augustus a \nvision of Mary, saying, "This woman is the Altar of Heaven." A church \nwas built on the spot, and named Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. 2 \n\n1 .

Graves, W.G., 395. \n\n\n\nGaius Tranquillus \nSuetonius Roman \nbiographer and \nhistorian, ca. 70- \n\n122A.D. \n\n\n\nHerodotus Greek \nhistorian of the 5th \ncentury B.C. \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\nGreek name for Goddess-worshipping tribes in north Africa, Anato- \nlia, and the Black Sea area. 1 Due to an erroneous belief that Amazon \nwarriors destroyed the right breast to be unhindered in drawing the \nbow, some derived the name from a-mazos, "breastless." But Greek rep- \nresentations of Amazons showed no such mutilation. The idea may \nhave arisen from Asiatic icons of the Primal Androgyne with a \nmale right half and female left half, echoed by a coalescence of the \nAmazon Goddess Artemis with her brother-consort Apollo. Scholars \nnow say the word Amazon meant "moon-woman." 2 \n\nSuetonius said, "Amazons once ruled over a large part of Asia." As \nlate as the 5th century a.d., the Black Sea was still known as the \nAmazon Sea.* Libya which used to mean all of North Africa except \nEgypt was also Amazonian. Herodotus spoke of Libyan Amazons. \nDiodorus, first century Greek historian, called them "the warlike \nwomen of Libya." To this day, north African Berbers call themselves \nAmazigh, though their common name came from Latin barbari, \n"barbarians." 4 \n\nThe ancients said Amazons were the first to tame horses, which \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\n\nmay well account for their armies\' legendary invincibility. 5 In open \ncountry, mounted troops whether male or female would have a decided \nadvantage over foot soldiers. \n\nIn Amazonian myths, the Goddess was often worshipped as a \nmare: India\'s mare-mother Saranyu, mare-headed Demeter, or \nCretan Leukippe the "White Mare," whose priests were castrated and \nwore female dress. 6 Among Scythians also, men entered the service \nof the Goddess by castrating themselves and adopting women\'s cloth- \ning. The only deity shown in Scythian art was the Great Goddess, \nwhom the Greeks called Artemis, or Hestia, or Gaea (the Earth). 7 \nSome of the Scythians settled in Parthia, "Virginland," named after \ntheir Goddess. They came to be known as Sacae, and their chief city \nwas Sacastene, now Seistan. 8 \n\nScythians were governed by priestess-queens, usually buried alone \nin richly furnished kurgans (queen-graves). Five kurganswere discov- \nered together at Pasyryk in southern Russia in 1954. Scythian \npriestesses were elder women, old enough to have gray hair. They \nperformed traditional sacrifices, catching the blood in sacred cauldrons \nand taking omens from the entrails. They also accompanied their \narmies into battle, to cast spells for victory. 9 \n\nThe moon-sickle used in mythical castrations of gods was a \nScythian weapon. A long-handled form therefore came to be called a \nscythe, and was assigned to the Grim Reaper, who was originally Rhea \nKronia in the guise of Mother Time, or Mother Death the Earth \nwho devoured her own children. Scythian women apparently used such \nweapons in battle as well as in religious ceremonies and agriculture. \nDiodorus said Scythian women "fight like the men and are nowise \ninferior to them in bravery." 10 A Scythian girl was allowed to marry \nonly after she had killed three enemies in battle. 11 \n\nIt wasn\'t unusual for barbarian armies to include women. Femi- \nnine magic power was often considered necessary for victory. The \nBible says Barak commanded an army of 10,000 men, but refused to go \ninto battle unless the priestess-queen Deborah went along, to cast \nvictory spells for him (Judges 4:8). Tacitus told of druidic forces \nrepelling Roman invaders on the island of Mona (Moon) in 61 a.d.: \namong the soldiers, black-clad women waved swords and cursed the \nenemy "like the Furies." 12 \n\nGreek myth says Amazon tribes occupied Cappadocia, Samo- \nthrace, and Lesbos, and founded the cities of Smyrna, Ephesus, \nCymes, Myrine, and Paphos all leading centers of Goddess-worship. \nAmazons came to the aid of matriarchal Troy in the Trojan War. \nThe Amazon queen Penthesileia fell beneath the sword of Achilles, \nwho immediately violated her dead body. Homer attributed this \nnecrophilic act to Achilles\'s love of her beautiful corpse. More likely, it \nwas a magic charm to immobilize her vengeful spirit. Greeks feared \nthe ghosts of slain Amazons. They called them Beautiful Ones, built \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\n\n\nCornelius Tacitus \n\nRoman historian \nand rhetorician, ca. \n56-120 a.d. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\n\n\nLebor Gabala \nErenn, also called the \nBook of Conquests: \nearly-medieval Irish \nhistory, purporting to \ntrace the origins of \nthe Irish tribes back to \nthe time of Adam. \n\n\n\nshrines to them, and offered them propitiatory sacrifices for centuries \nafter the war. 13 \n\nTheseus, king of Attica, violated the Amazons\' law of matrilocal \nmarriage by kidnapping their queen, variously named Hippolyta, \nAntiope, or Melanippe (Black Mare). Some said Antiope was the sister \nof Hippolyta. The former was slain by Theseus, the latter by \nHeracles, who wished to steal her magic girdle. Enraged, the Amazons \ninvaded Greece, ravaged coastal towns, and besieged Athens. 14 \nAmazons and Greeks became hereditary enemies. A later Amazon \nqueen named Artemisia (Spirit of Artemis) joined Xerxes to fight the \nGreeks at the battle of Salamis in 480 b.c. not because she loved \nPersians, but because she hated Greeks. 15 \n\nGreek myths mention several Islands of Women, where Amazons \nlived without men, only consorting with neighboring colonies of \nmales at certain seasons when they wanted to conceive their children. \nTaurus, Lemnos, and Lesbos were said to be such all-female societ- \nies. The Greeks apparently feared them. They said the women of \nTaurus sacrificed to their Goddess all men who landed on their \nshores; and the women of Lemnos had risen up against their husbands \nand murdered all of them at once. 16 The Greek writers seemed to \nhave no doubt that women could destroy whole populations of adult \nmales, and there was no effective defense against them. \n\nNorthern Europe had mythical Amazons: the Valkyries, warrior- \nmaidens of Valhalla. There were also real Amazons among the \nVikings: female captains and war-chieftainesses. 17 In the 10th century \na.d. a Norwegian fleet invaded Ireland and devastated Ulster and the \nnortheast, under the command of a warrior queen called the Red \nMaiden. 18 Another warrior queen, Olga, was one of the first rulers of \nKiev. 19 Medieval historians said Amazons ruled the city of Ulm from \nbefore the time of Abraham to the time of Alexander the Great. The \ncity was named for the sacred elms (ulmae) of the grove where they \nworshipped Diana-Artemis. 20 \n\nAgain and again, legends mention the women\'s magic battle-cries, \nwhich made their enemies helpless. The Valkyrie Kara deprived her \nenemies of power to wield their weapons by the sound of her voice. 21 A \nCeltic Valkyrie, Nemhain, cursed Cu Chulainn\'s warriors and made \na hundred of them drop dead on the spot. 22 \n\nThe Lebor Gabala Erenn Book of the Taking of Ireland said \nthe very first expedition of colonists to Ireland was led by a woman. 23 \nIreland had female soldiers up to the 7th century a.d., when Christian \nlegal reforms forbade women to bear arms. 24 The tradition persisted \nin connection with weddings. A bride\'s costume up to the 17th century \nincluded a knife at the belt. 25 But after the 9th century, female \nwarriors in Celtic lands were labeled "witches." 26 In the Amazons\' \nterritory around the Black Sea, women retained certain Amazon \n\n\n\n26 \n\n\n\ncustoms up to the 18th century: dressing in men\'s clothes, riding Ambrosia \n\nhorseback astride, and fighting beside the men in war. 27 Amphitrite \n\n1.

In the Acts of the Apostles, Ananias \nwas (1) a holy man, Paul\'s instructor, who accepted Paul\'s faith; (2) an \nenemy, who struck Paul and publicly shamed him; and finally (3) "a \nliar unto God," who held back some of his money from the apostles, \nthough they seemed to think he must surrender all of it. For this \noffense, St. Peter made Ananias "fall down dead" along with his wife \nSapphira, and young men of the apostles\' sect buried them. The \napostles were imprisoned for murder, but "an angel" came secretly at \nnight and let them out of jail (Acts 5:1-19). \n\nThis curious story was much repeated in connection with collec- \ntion of church taxes. Withholders of tithes were called "liars" like \nthe sinful Ananias. \n\n\n\nAnaximander \n\nMilesian philosopher, \nastronomer, and \ngeographer, 6th \ncentury B.C. \n\n\n\nAnanke \n\n"Necessity," a Neoplatonic-Pythagorean title of the Goddess who \ngoverned the world according to karmic law; another name for Fortuna, \nor Fate. "What we call causality in the West has its roots in the \nGreek images of Ananke (Necessity), Dike (Justice), Heimarmene \n(Allotted Fate), and Nemesis (Retribution) all goddesses which \nwere feared and respected." Anaximander said it was according to \nAnanke that the "source of generation for all things is that into which \ntheir destruction also leads." Stoic philosophers made Ananke or Hei- \nmarmene the supreme all-ruling world principle, with absolute \nauthority over even the gods. The Orphics said Ananke was mated to \nChronos (Time), which gave rise to the concept of supernatural \nduality known as Time-and-Fate. 1 It might be said there was no Greek \n\n\n\n28 \n\n\n\nidea of "God" that could transcend or overrule the feminine image of \nAnanke as the inescapable What-Must-Be. \n\n\n\n1. von Franz, 23. \n\n\n\nAnanta \nAnath \n\n\n\nAnanta \n\n"The Infinite," a great serpent in whose coils Hindu gods spent their \nperiods of sleep or death between periods of activity. 1 The serpent \nmight be compared to the ancient Egyptian goddess Mehen the \nEnveloper, a serpent who enfolded Ra every night when he was "dead" \nin the underworld. The sex of the eternal serpent was indeterminate. \nEarlier myths tended to see it as female, a cosmic Kundalini. Later \nVedic traditions tended to view Ananta as male. \n\nl.O\'Flaherty,221,340. \n\n\n\nAnastasia, Saint \n\n"She Who Stands in Heaven," title of Rome\'s Great Goddess, \npersonified as a pseudo-saint. Her three "serving-maids" Agapeta, \nTheonia, and Irene were originally the three Horae or Graces who \nattended the Goddess. \n\nHer Christianized legend associated Agapeta, Theonia, and Irene \nwith a man who suffered a ceremonial death in the same way as \nancient victims of the pagan Mamuralia or scapegoat-sacrifice. He was \nbeaten with rods, reviled and spat upon, then shown a vision of the \nTriple Goddess in his moment of death, whereupon he "fell into a sleep \nso deep" that no further blows could waken him. 1 \n\nHagiographers claimed Anastasia was another one of the "virgin \nmartyrs" slain by Diocletian\'s persecution. However, modern schol- \nars admit that she never existed except as a label on statues of the \nGoddess, which were re-interpreted as images of a saint. 2 Her holy \nday was the same as that of the sun\'s birth from the Great Mother at the \nwinter solstice: December 25. By the old lunar calendar, this festival \nbegan with its Eve, December 24, called Matrum Noctem, "Night of \nthe Mother." 3 \n\nl.deVoragine ( 52. 2. Attwater, 44. 3.

Greek- \nspeaking Phoenicians in Cyprus called her "Anat, Strength of Life." \nAn Egyptian stele of the time of Rameses II addressed her as Queen of \n\n\n\nvar. Anatha, Anat, \nNeit, or Ath-enna; \nEgyptian: Aynat \n\n\n\n29 \n\n\n\nAnath \n\n\n\nRas Shamra texts \n\nCuneiform tablets \ndiscovered in 1929 in \nthe Ras Shamra \nmound, northern Syria, \nsite of the ancient \nCanaanite capital city of \nUgarit. The texts \nreveal Canaanite \nfoundations of biblical \nmaterial. \n\n\n\nHeaven and Mistress of All the Gods. Under the Greek Ptolemaic \ndynasty she ruled both Egypt and Palestine. Semitic texts named her \nVirgin Daughter of Palestine, or Virgin Wisdom Dwelling in Zion. 1 \n\nThe Jerusalem temple was occupied for centuries by both God \n(El) and this Goddess, variously known as Queen of Heaven, Anat, \nAsherah, Mari, or Miriam. 2 Her sanctuary Beth-Anath (House of \nAnath) is mentioned in the 19th chapter of Joshua. Some early \nIsraelite chieftains called themselves her sons, like Shamgar ben Anath, \nwho "slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad" \n(Judges 3:3 1). The ox goad was a magic spell, represented by the letter \nlamedh, which means "ox goad." In Sicily, a Phoenician settlement \nwas named after this Goddess, Mach-Anath. Greeks called it Panorma, \nmeaning Universal Mountain Mother. 3 \n\nPrimitive sacrificial rites of Anath or Anat were described in the \nRas Shamra texts. She was fertilized by the blood of men, not by their \nsemen, because her worship dated all the way back to the Neolithic \nwhen fatherhood was unknown and blood was considered the only \nsubstance that could transmit life. Hecatombs of men seem to have \nbeen sacrificed to Anath when her image was reddened with "rouge \nand henna" for the occasion. 4 "Violently she smites and gloats, Anat \ncuts them down arid gazes; her liver exults in mirth ... for she \nplunges her knees in the blood of the soldiers, her loins in the gore of \nthe warriors, till she has had her fill of slaughtering in the house, of \ncleaving among the tables." 5 In similar rites in Egypt, priestesses hoisted \nup their skirts while dismembering the bull god Apis so his spurting \nblood would bathe their loins and fertilize them. 6 \n\nLike the Mexican "Lady of the Serpent Skirt," who made new life \nfrom Quetzalcoatl\'s genital blood, Anath hung the shorn penises of \nher victims on her goatskin apron, or aegis. 7 When the Goddess was \ntransplanted to Greece and permanently virginized as Athene, her \naegis was transformed from the ceremonial apron of Libyan priestesses \ninto a breastplate. 8 Athene still wore "serpents" (phalli) on her aegis, \nalong with the Gorgon head of her Destroyer aspect. Gorgon, "Grim \nOne," was Athene\'s title as a Death-goddess. 9 See Medusa; Metis; \nNeith. \n\nAnath annually cast her death-curse, anathema, on the Canaanite \ngod who became Lord of Death: Mot, the castrated "Sterility" aspect \nof the fertile Baal. Like Set in Egypt, Mot stood for the barren season \nthat slew its own fertile twin, the god Aleyin. In typical sacred-king \nstyle, Mot- Aleyin was the son of the Virgin Anath and also the \nbridegroom of his own mother. Like Jesus too, he was the Lamb of \nGod. He said, "I am Aleyin, son of Baal (the Lord). Make ready, then, \nthe sacrifice. I am the lamb which is made ready with pure wheat to \nbe sacrificed in expiation." 10 \n\nAfter Aleyin\'s death, Anath resurrected him and sacrificed Mot in \nturn. She told Mot that he was forsaken by his heavenly father El, the \nsame god who "forsook" Jesus on the cross. The words attributed to \n\n\n\n30 \n\n\n\nJesus, "My El, my El, why hast thou forsaken me? " (Mark 1 5:34), Anath \n\napparently were copied from the ancient liturgical formula, which \n\nbecame part of the Passover ritual at Jerusalem. \n\nThe sacred drama included a moment when Anath broke Mot\'s \nreed scepter, to signify his castration again foreshadowing a detail of \nthe Christian Gospels. The breaking of the scepter meant severing the \nconnection of the old, played-out king with the Earth-goddess after \nthe harvest of his reign. Anath therefore slew him and used his body and \nblood to refresh the soil for the next year\'s crop. "She seizes Mot, the \nson divine. With her sickle she cleaves him. With her flail she beats \nhim." His pieces were scattered on the fields, like pieces of the Savior \nOsiris in Egypt. 11 \n\nNaturally, the god-killing Anath was much diabolized in later \npatriarchal legends. Abyssinian Christians called her Aynat, "the evil \neye of the earth." They said she was an old witch destroyed by Jesus, \nwho commanded that she must be burned and her ashes scattered on \nthe wind. 12 The hostility of Jesus probably stemmed from the missionar- \nies\' deliberate reversal of his former identification with the destroyed \ngod. \n\nIn the Christian Gospels, Anath \'s death curse Anathema Mara- \nnatha (1 Corinthians 16:22) has been very loosely translated "the \nBridegroom cometh." It really meant the Bridegroom\'s imminent \ndeath; it was the solemn curse pronounced over any sacrificial \nvictim. 13 It carried the same double meaning as Latin sacer, meaning \nboth "holy" and "accursed" like all dying gods, who were formerly \nanathemata, "offerings." H Every nation has examples of gods chosen \nfor the sacred marriage, then accursed and killed. The Celtic God- \ndess\'s fatal words marked for death such heroes as Cu Chulainn and \nDiarmuid. The god called Lord of the Hunt became le Chasseur \nMaudit, "the Accursed Huntsman." \n\nThe origin of accursed heroes in general might be found in \nancient India, where Shiva the Condemned One was chosen by Sati- \nKali for the sacred marriage with her virgin incarnation, followed by his \ndeath and journey to the underworld. 15 As a personification of the \nPrimordial Abyss, the Goddess was sometimes called Kala-Nath, which \nmight have been related to the name of Anath. 16 \n\nAnath\'s capacity to curse and kill made even the Heavenly Father \nafraid of her. When El seemed reluctant to do her bidding, she \nthreatened to smash his head and cover his gray hair and beard with \ngore. He hastily gave her everything she asked, saying, "Whoever \nhinders thee will be crushed." 17 It was a long step from this Middle- \nEastern tale to the Greek concept of the dread Goddess as the \nHeavenly Father\'s ever-dutiful daughter.

In medieval Christian usage, to \nbe pronounced Anathema was to be cast out of the congregation with \nbell, book, and candle, and irrevocably consigned to hell: a curious \nreminiscence of the accursed god\'s temporary descent into the under- \nworld, in the ancient religion. \n\n\n\nX \n\n\n\nSt. Andrew\'s Cross \n\n\n\nAndrew, Saint \n\nFrom Greek andros, "man" or "virility," a title of the solar god of \nPatras, in Achaea, where the apostle Andrew was supposed to have \nbeen crucified after founding the Byzantine papacy. \' St. Andrew\'s \nlegend was invented by Byzantine bishops to counter Rome\'s claim to \nprimacy through its own legend of St. Peter. Eastern patriarchs \nupheld their magisterium by calling Andrew the elder brother of Peter, \nto enhance his authority, and declaring him the first apostle to \ndiscover the Messiah. 2 \n\nThe story that Andrew was crucified on an X-shaped cross, the \nso-called St. Andrew\'s Cross, was unknown until the Middle Ages. \nApparently it evolved from a popular symbol of the eastern patri- \narchs, a solar cross in an orb. 3 It was also the Cross of Wotan carried by \nNorse invaders into Scotland, where it became the present Scottish \nnational symbol. \n\nPatras, the site of Andrew\'s alleged martyrdom, was an old shrine \nof the phallic-solar father-god variously called Pater, Petra, or Peter, \nwhose name had the same basic meaning as Andrew. Political battles \nbetween the factions of Andrew and Peter in the 4th century a.d. \nstimulated canonical disguises for local genii loci in both Byzantium and \nRome, and these are still preserved in the calendar of saints. 4 \n\nl.Attwater,45. 2.

The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad said the Primal Andro- \ngyne was "of the same size and kind as man and woman closely \nembracing." 1 Some said the male and female elements lived together in \none skin, experiencing constant sexual bliss and spiritual \ncompleteness. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\n\nShiva and Shakti-Kali appeared as the androgyne Ardhanaris- Androgyne \n\nvara, the right side male, the left side female. 2 Rudra, the older form of \n\nShiva, was known as "the Lord Who is Half Woman." 3 Brahma ^_^__^^__ \n\nand Vishnu also appeared as bisexual beings united with their Shaktis. \nChinese Taoists held the mandala of Yang and Yin to represent the \nandrogyne. \n\nWestern myths also assigned androgyny to the elder gods or the \nfirst human beings. The Orphic creation myth said the firstborn deity \nwas a double-sexed Phanes or Eros, "Carnal Love," whose female half \nwas Psyche, the soul, Greek equivalent of Shakti. 4 Hermes owed his \nphenomenal wisdom to his former androgynous existence with Mother \nAphrodite, as double-sexed Hermaphroditus. 5 \n\nOften, the androgyne appeared in myth as male-female twins born \nsimultaneously, e.g. Isis-Osiris, Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, Fauna- \nFaunus, Helen-Helenus, or Artemis-Apollo, the "moon and sun" \nunited in their Mother\'s womb. Probably an androgynous image on \nApollo\'s altar at Delos gave rise to the story that he copulated with his \nsister Artemis on that altar. Several forms of the sun god were \nrepresented as requiring close physical union with the moon goddess, as \neven Brahma was useless without his female counterpart Bhavani, \n"Being." 6 Egypt\'s "supreme" sun god was often an androgyne; the sun \nwas his right eye, the moon his left. 7 The same androgynous being is \nstill worshipped in Dahomey as Nana-Buluku, Moon-Sun, who created \nthe world and gave birth to the first pair of human beings. 8 \n\nMany myths model the first human beings on the androgyne. \nPersians said the first pair in the garden of Heden (Eden) lived \ntogether in one body, until Ahura Mazda separated them. Jewish \nimitators of the Persians also said Adam and Eve were united in a \nbisexual body. Some rabbinical sources said Eve was not "taken out \nof" Adam; they were parted from one another by a jealous God who \nresented their sexual bliss, which was too Godlike for human beings, \nand should be reserved for deities. Casting man out of the "garden" \nmeant detaching him from the female body, often symbolized by the \nHebrew pardes, "garden." 9 This was another way of saying the \noriginal sin that angered God was not disobedience but sex. 10 \n\nGreek myths of the Golden Age told the same tale of a jealous \nGod: Zeus, who punished humanity\'s friend Prometheus with \neternal torture because he tricked the Heavenly Father for human- \nity\'s advantage (see Sacrifice). The people of the Golden Age had been \ncreated androgynous by Prometheus, who made their bodies of clay, \nand Athene, who gave them life. Father Zeus took out his anger on \nthem by tearing them apart. A piece of clay was torn out of the \nfemale part and stuck to the male part. That is why women have an \norifice that bleeds, and men have a loose dangling appendage that \nseems not to belong to them but always craves to return to the female \nbody it came from. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\n\nAndrogyne \n\n\n\nNaassenes, or \n\nNaassians; from \nHebrew nahash, "ser- \npent." Jewish or \nChristian Gnostic sects \nof the early Christian \nera, who worshipped \nthe serpent god \nOphis (Hermes) as a \nform of the Savior. \n\nMysteries General \nterm for religious rites \nof the "secret \ninitiation" type, which \nincluded early \nChristianity. \n\n\n\nCruel Zeus permitted human beings to return the male appendage \nto its female home sometimes, to sense for a brief moment the bliss of \ntheir former bisexual existence. Some Gnostic mystery cults of the first \ncenturies a.d. taught Tantric techniques to prolong the moment of \nbliss, which angered most forms of the Heavenly Father including the \nChristian one, whose bishops denounced this training as schooling \nin wickedness. 11 Church fathers especially deplored making or re- \nmaking the Beast with Two Backs, another term for the Primal \nAndrogyne. \n\nThough orthodox Christianity renounced both sexuality and an- \ndrogyny in religious images, Gnostic Christians used them. As Kali \nwas the female half of Shiva, so the Gnostic Great Mother Sophia was \nthe female half of Christ. This was revealed "in a great light": the \nSavior was shown as an androgyne coupled with "Sophia, Mother of \nAll." 12 \n\nGnostic Christians said those who received the true revelation of \nthe Father-Mother spirit were the only ones prepared for the secret \nsacrament called apolytrosis, "release," a concept identical with Tantric \nmoksha or "liberation." n Obviously influenced by Tantrism or its \nprototype, western Gnostics had made a direct translation of the Hindu \nYab-Yum, "Father-Mother," the sexual union of a sage and his \nShakti at the crucial moment of death. 14 Sexual sacraments were in \neffect practicing for that moment, when the enlightened one would \nbe restored to the condition of primordial bliss as an androgynous \ncreature. \n\nThe Naassenes said no enlightenment was possible without the \nFather-Mother spirit, an androgyne sometimes called Heavenly \nHorn of the Moon. 15 In the 5th century a.d., Orphic initiations sought \nto awaken a female spirit within man, to render him sensitive to the \nmessage of the Mysteries. After meeting the deities in a death-and- \nrebirth experience, he carried a bowl, emblem of the womb, and \ntouched his belly like a gravid woman, signifying "a spiritual experience \nuniting the opposed ways of knowledge of the male and female, and \nfused with this idea is that of a new life conceived within." 16 \n\nSuch Gnostic subtleties were disliked by the orthodox, who viewed \nall mergings of the sexes as unequivocally sinful. After Gnostic sects \nwere crushed, the androgyne was consigned to hell and gave birth to \nmany curious devils with both male and female attributes. A 1 6th- \ncentury book showed Satan himself seated on a throne, wearing a papal \ntiara, with bird feet, a female face in his genital area, and pendulous \nfemale breasts. 17 The Devil of the Tarot pack was usually androgynous, \nas were many of the devils represented in cathedral carvings. \n\n1.0\'Flaherty,34. 2.

Perseus seems to have been a Greek name for Baal in this \n\nmyth, for Baal annually fought Yamm for the love of Mother Astarte, \n\nthe Philistines\' Goddess, locally named Atargatis. Baal replaced \n\nYamm, then was himself replaced when the queen tired of him and he \n\nbecame Yamm in his turn. Andromeda on her rock, in the classic \n\nmyth, was transformed from a critical observer of the combat into a \n\nvictim. \n\nThat Perseus played the role of sacred king in the original myth \nis shown by his apotheosis and rising to dwell in the stars. So also \nHeracles was raised to the stars after performing the same feat \nslaying the great sea serpent in order to mate with Hesione, "Queen of \nAsia," probably just another name for Andromeda-Atargatis. 1 \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,224. \n\n\n\nAndrophonos \n\n"Man-slayer," title of the Goddess Aphrodite as a Destroyer or \ndeath-goddess. She was also the Black One, the Goddess of the Tombs, \nand the Queen Bee who killed her lovers as drone bees are killed, by \ncastration and evisceration. She had "many titles which seem inconsist- \nent with her beauty and complaisance." \' That was because classic \nmythographers sought to make her a love goddess only, ignoring her \nearlier character as the creating-and-destroying Triple Goddess (see \nTrinity). \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,71-72. \n\n\n\nAngels \n\nThe earliest angels were heavenly nymphs, like Hindu apsaras, who \ndispensed sensual bliss to the blessed ones. Vikings called them \nValkyries. Greeks called them Horae. Persians called them Houris, or \nPeris (fairies). A guardian angel was a personal Shakti who watched \nover a man and took him into her ecstatic embrace at the moment \nof death. N \n\nHindu angels were created primarily for lovemaking. They had no \nmenstruation, pregnancy, birth, or nursing, though they were moth- \ners. Each child appeared miraculously on its mother\'s knee at the age of \nfive years. Apsaras could copulate endlessly with gods without any \nemission of fluids or loss of energy. Such a being was "the perfect \ndispenser of sensual delight and amorous bliss on a divine scale." 1 \nLike the queen of the Holy Grail palace in bardic romance, the angel \nwas a "Dispenser of Joy." (See Grail, Holy.) \n\n\n\n35 \n\n\n\nAngerona \n\n\n\nMagic Papyri \n\nCollections of \nexorcisms, invocations, \ncharms, and spells \nwidely circulated during \nthe early Christian \nera, used as bases for \nlater grimoires and \nHermetic texts. \n\n\n\nThere were earthy angels too, the dakinis, "Skywalkers." Tantric \nwritings said they lived in the Palace of Lotus Light. They were \nsometimes called prostitutes\' daughters, or yoginis, i.e., yoga- \npriestesses. 2 \n\nAlthough such angels seemed to be every man\'s wish fulfillment, \npatriarchal religions denied the sexuality of angels. Moslems rejected \nthe Houris (heavenly "whores"), and insisted the angels are without \ncarnal desires. 3 Yet this contradicted the teaching of the Koran, that \nafter death every hero would receive beautiful girls as heavenly \ncompanions. 4 \n\nEuropean Christianity consigned the formerly divine Horae to \nFairyland, the earthly paradise distinguished from the celestial one. \nThe place was called locus voluptatis terrestis, the Terrestrial Place of \nPleasure, or pratum felicitatus, the Paradise of Joy. 5 \n\nAngels were often confused with seraphs and cherubs. The former \nwere six-winged fiery flying serpents, the lightning-spirits of Chalde- \nan myth. The latter were Semitic kerubh, from Sheban mu-karrib, \n"priests of the moon"; sometimes they could take the form of birds. \nAngels accompanying the Hindu Great Goddess were able to fly on the \nwings of garuda birds. 6 \n\nBiblical angels were "sons of God" who came to earth to beget \nchildren on mortal women (Genesis 6:4). Later these were called \ndemons, or incubi, or "fallen" angels. The Book of Enoch blamed \nwomen for the angels\' fall. Women had "led astray the angels of \nheaven." 7 In the Magic Papryi, the words angel, spirit, god, and demon \nwere interchangeable. 8 When St. Paul said women\'s heads must be \ncovered in church "because of the angels" (1 Corinthians 1 1:10), he \nmeant the daemones (demons) supposed to be attracted to women\'s \nhair. The Greeks thought each person had an individual guardian angel \nor daemon which could appear in animal form, and under Christian- \nity evolved into the "familiar spirit." There were no really well-defined \ndistinctions between angels, demons, familiars, fairies, elves, saints, \ngenii, ancestral ghosts, or pagan gods. 9 Among supernatural beings one \nmight always find many hazy areas of overlapping identities, even \n"good" or "evil" qualities being blurred. \n\nA Gallup poll showed in 1978 that over half of all Americans still \nbelieve in angels. 10 \n\n1.

Some said Angerona represented the secret name of Rome, \nwhich it was illegal to pronounce. 1 In all probability she was a pre- \n\n\n\n36 \n\n\n\nRoman title of the same primal Creatress whom Gnostics called Sige, \n"Silence," personifying the lightless and soundless womb that gave \nbirth to the first deities. Gnostics said Silence was the mother of the \nGreat Goddess herself. \n\n1. Larousse, 214. \n\n\n\nAngurboda \nAnkamma \n\n\n\nAngurboda \n\nEddaic "Hag of the Iron Wood," mother of Hel and of the Moon- \ndogs who bore away the dead. Danaans, or Danes, knew her as Anu, \nYngona, Nanna, or "Anna of the Angles." She was a "hag" in the \nancient sense of "Holy One"; the Death-goddess. 1 See Dog. \n\n1. Graves, W.G, 409. \n\n\n\nAnima \n\nFemale soul, from the roots an, "heavenly," and ma, "mother," \nrecalling a time when all souls were supposed to emanate from the \nHeavenly Mother. 1 In the 16th century a.d. Guillaume Postel said \nevery soul had male and female halves, the animus and anima. The \nmale half had been redeemed by Christ, but the female half was still \nunredeemed and awaited a female savior. 2 This was a new development \nof the old Christian view that only males had any souls at all. The \nthird canon of the Council of Nantes in 660 a.d. had decided that all \nwomen are "soulless brutes." 5 \n\nAlchemists applied the word anima to all "spirits" considered \nfemale: Anima Mercury, Anima Mundi, etc. The Spirit of the World \nwas connected with the elements of earth and water, like Eleusinian \nDemeter, "Mistress of Earth and Sea." One reason alchemists were \nsuspected of heresy was their notion that the World-Soul was a female \nanima. \n\nCarl Jung revived the terms animus and anima to describe reason- \ning and intuitive parts of the mind (i.e., left and right hemispheres). \nEvery person\'s anima is "often symbolically connected with both earth \nand water. She is pictured as timeless and profoundly wise. . . . Each \nman\'s first and formative experience of the anima is with his mother. \nHer true function in the mind, according to Jung, is creativity." 4 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 410. 2.

Its other name \nwas Key of the Nile, because the sacred marriage between God and \nGoddess was supposed to take place at the source of the Nile each year \nbefore the flood. The Christian version of the Cross of Life, which \ndidn\'t appear in Christian art until after the 5th century a.d., sig- \nnificantly lacked the feminine oval and kept only the masculine part \nof the figure. 1 \n\nThe ankh seems to have evolved from an ancient symbol of the \nGoddess in Libya and Phoenicia: a narrow triangle surmounted by \na crossbar and a round or oval head. 2 \n\nt Egyptians regarded the ankh as a universal life-charm. "The life of \n\nevery being, divine or human, depended on his or her possession of \nit. From first to last the gods are seen carrying it in their right hands, and \nthey gave life to their kings and servants presenting it to them." 3 \nEarly Christians also used the ankh occasionally as an emblem of \n\nimmortality, calling it an ansated cross. They knew the Egyptians had \n\nAnkh a certain letter-hieroglyph that "stood for the life to come; and this letter \n\nhad the form of a cross." 4 In hieroglyphics the ankh stood simply for \nthe word "life." 5 \n\nI.

The name meant Lady of Heaven. See Anne, Saint. \n\n\n\nAnnapurna \n\nHimalayan mountain called Great Breast Full of Nourishment; a \nmanifestation of the Great Goddess as the home and support of the \ngods. \n\n\n\nAnne, Saint \n\nMythical mother of the virgin Mary, from the Middle-Eastern \nGoddess Anna, or Hannah, or Di-Ana, mother of Mari. From Sumeria \nto pre-Roman Latium she was known as Anna, the Grandmother- \nGoddess; Anatha in Syria, Anat in Canaan, Ana or Anah in several Old \nTestament transformations. Long before the Bible was written, the \nGoddess Anna was already known as the Grandmother of God. Hence, \n\n\n\n38 \n\n\n\nthe choice of her name for the mother of God\'s Mother is hardly Anne, Saint \n\nsurprising. 1 \n\nSyriac versions of the Book of James said God\'s Grandmother was ^^^^^^^^ \nnot Anna but Dinah, actually the same name, a Semitic Di-Ana or \n"Goddess Ana." Dinah was the ancestress of Dinaite tribes who settled \nin Sumeria (Ezra 4:9). As Anatha, she was the consort of Yahweh at \nElephantine. 2 As Anna Perenna she was Grandmother Time to the \nRomans, mother of the Aeons. As Ana or Anu she ruled Celtic \ntribes. As Nanna, she was an incarnation of Freya in the mother-bride of \nBalder. In Phrygia too, she was Nana, mother of the Savior. She was \nreally as old as the oldest civilization. A Sumerian prayer declared: \n"Hear O ye regions, the praise of Queen Nana; magnify the \nCreatress, exalt the dignified, exalt the Glorious One, draw nigh unto \nthe Mighty Lady." 3 \n\nRomans worshipped the Goddess as Anna Perenna, "Eternal \nAnna," mother of the Aeons. She stood at the change of years, a two- \nheaded Goddess of Time with two faces named Prorsa and Postverta, \nlooking forward and backward from her heavenly gate among the \nstars, where one celestial cycle merged into the next. So she stood for \nboth Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. Under the name of \nCarmenta she invented all the letters in between. 4 She was also Jana, or \nJuno, mother of the January New Year. Classical myths masculin- \nized her as the two-faced Janus, god of gateways. Christians may have \nconfused icons labeled IANA with the mother of the Virgin; for Jana- \nJuno was the virgin mother of the savior-god Mars. \n\nOvid said Anna was the same as the Moon-goddess Minerva. \nSappho named her "the Queen." 5 To the Celts, she was the same as \ntheir Ana, first of the female trinity of the Morrigan, associated with the \nCauldron of Regeneration. Her moon-temple used to stand at Cnoc \nAine in Limerick, now a shrine of "St. Anne." 6 To Irish pagans, Ana \nmeant "mother." It also came to mean wealth, plenty, treasure. 7 \n\nAs Grandmother-goddess, Ana could be a destroying Crone. \nSome myths called her Morg-ana, "Invincible Queen Death." Medi- \neval Christians called her Anna of the Angles, or Black Annis, or \nAngurboda, the Hag of the Iron Wood, mother of Hel. 8 The magic \npentacle was the sign of Morg-ana. 9 A similar five-pointed star stood for \nthe underworld in Egyptian hieroglyphics. 10 This same star was the \nofficial sigil of St. Anne. 11 \n\nIn her Christianized form, Anne had three husbands, gave birth to \nmany saints, and became the patron of midwives and miners. Neu- \nmann says, "All this bears witness to her original fertility aspect as Earth \nMother." n \n\nSt. Anne was of crucial importance in the dogma of the virgin \nMary\'s immaculate conception, adopted as an article of faith in \n1854, after seven centuries of controversy. 13 In the official Catholic \nview, original sin was transmitted by sexual acts. Therefore, so Mary \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\n\nAntic Hey \nAntichrist \n\n\n\nJohannes Trithemius \n\n15th-century \nGerman scholar, Abbot \nof Sponheim \n\n\n\ncould be born without taint of original sin, St. Anne herself had to be in- \nnocent of sexuality. Accordingly, Johannes Trithemius proclaimed \nthat Anne "was chosen by God for her appointed services before the \nfoundation of the world. She conceived \'without the action of man,\' \nand was as pure as her daughter." H \n\nAt first the church accepted this doctrine, because it seemed to \nsolve the problem of Mary\'s sinlessness. Later it was rejected. Two \nvirgin births made one too many. In the end, St. Anne was said to have \nconceived Mary in the normal way but the child was freed in the \nwomb of original sin. Though these intimate matters are supposed to be \nknown in minute detail, churchmen incongruously admit that "noth- \ning whatever is known about the parents of the Virgin Mary." 15 \n\n1.

Carnival "antics" were connected with \nthe Old Religions, whose sacred processions were often accompanied \nby clowns deliberately making obscene gestures and jokes to heighten \nthe spirit of revelry. 1 The "hey" was, and is, a figure-eight pattern \npaced on the ground, the sign meaning "infinity" in Hindu-Arabic \nnumeral systems and in their descendant, modern mathematics. \nChoruses of old folk songs call for the hey, in nonsense phrases like \n"Hey, nonny nonny," or "Hey, deny down." Thus the antic hey was \nreally a pagan liturgy in song or dance or both, performed at secularized \nversions of the ancient rites. \n1. Funk, p. 54. \n\n\n\nAntichrist \n\nVirgin-born son of the devil, supposed to appear during the world\'s \nLast Days. Christianity never escaped the patterns of dualism, whereby \neach god had to have an equal and opposite anti-god. Antichrist was \nthe Christian equivalent of Chaldean Aciel, lord of the nether world, \ncounterbalancing the solar god of the heavens. \n\nThe coming of Antichrist has been announced and re-announced \nthroughout the entire Christian era, especially in times of political \nand social stress. His title has been laid on Nero, Attila, Genghis Khan, \nMerlin, Frederick II, and many others including several popes. More \nrecently, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, and Hitler were all nominated for \nthe position. See Doomsday. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n\n\nAntinomianism \n\nGeneral term for Christian sects that followed the original doctrine of \napotheosis, believing they could become "one with Christ." Like their \npagan contemporaries, many early Christians thought the only route \nto immortality was deification, and the object of their Mysteries was to \nlearn how to be deified. The distinction between men and gods was \nthat men died and gods didn\'t. Thus, one\'s immortality depended on \nbecoming a god, often by sacramental procedures such as eating a \ngod\'s flesh and blood (see Cannibalism). \n\nClement of Alexandria said: "That man with whom the Logos \n\ndwells ... is made like God and is beautiful [T]hat man becomes \n\nGod, for God so wills it [T]he Logos of God became man that from \n\nman you might learn how man may become God. . . . [T]he true \nChristian Gnostic has already become God." l \n\nThis doctrine of deification was soundly based on pagan prece- \ndent. Worshippers of Hermes the Logos believed that "This is the \ngood end for those who have attained knowledge, namely, Deification." \nThey said to Hermes, "Thou art I, and I am thou; thy name is mine, \nfor I am thy image (eidolon)." Mithraists used the same formula, "I am \nthou and thou art I," which the Gospels put in the mouth of Jesus, \n"Abide in me, and I in you" (John 1 5:4). Seneca said, "A holy spirit \ndwells within us." Epictetus wrote: "You are bearing a God with \nyou. ... It is within yourself that you carry him." Cicero said initiation \ninto the Mysteries taught a man he could be God, "inferior in no \nwhit to the celestials." 2 \n\nThe theological pitfall in the concept of salvation through apotheo- \nsis was that identification of self and god led to what Tantric sages \ncalled Svecchacara, "Do As You Will." In effect, the perfected sage \ncould do nothing evil because he was God, and God was incapable of \nsinning. 3 Therefore he was above all man-made laws, and could do \nas he pleased. \n\nGreek democracy was based on a related idea that through \nenlightenment and reason each citizen would become capable of self- \ngovernment and would make no moral errors. This did not apply to \nslaves, women, or those who owned no property; such were not \nclassed as citizens. Mature male landowners however could become \nidiotae, "self-gods." 4 Thus the word "idiot" began in Greek with the \nsense of "one who will not be governed," that is, one who believed the \ndivine will dwelt in himself. \n\nNumerous medieval Christian sects took the Antinomian route to \nsalvation, believing that, like eastern sages, they could become one \nwith the divine. These mystics "in their identification with God sup- \nposed that upon their conscious union with Him they were exempt \nfrom the rules governing ordinary men." Leaders like Amalric of Bena, \nJohann Hartmann, sects like the Alumbrados, Illuminates, Adamites, \nand others taught that when their flesh was occupied by the holy spirit \n\n\n\nAntinomianism \n\n\n\nClement of \nAlexandria (Titus \nFlavius Clemens) \nChristian presbyter and \nteacher of the late \n2nd century a.d., once \nreckoned a saint, but \nremoved from the \ncanon of saints in \n1586 by Pope SixtusV. \n\nAlumbrados, \n\n"Enlightened Ones" \nSpanish heretics of \nthe 15th to 17th \ncenturies, recruited \nfrom reform \nmovements among \nthe Jesuits and \nFranciscans. They \nwere eventually \nexterminated by the \nInquisition. \n\nIlluminati or \n\n"Perfectibilists" \nBavarian secret \nsociety founded by \nAdam Weishaupt, a \nformer Jesuit. The \nsociety was banned \nin 1785. \n\nAdamites 18th- \ncentury sectaries who \nbelieved nakedness \nrepresented the natural \nstate of innocence in \nwhich Adam dwelt \nbefore he "fell" into \nsin, and began to clothe \nhimself. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n\n\nAnubis they could commit no sins of the flesh. For them, sexual promiscuity \n\nwas only a natural "embracing of God." 5 \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Brothers and Sisters of the Free Spirit undertook to demonstrate \n\nthe redemptive virtues of sexuality, nakedness, and scorn of the \nconventions. The more openly they displayed their hippie-like beha- \nviors, the more closely they approached the divine essence. Frazer \nremarked, "Their progress toward this mystic communion was acceler- \nated by the Inquisition, and they expired in the flames, not merely \nwith unclouded serenity, but with the most triumphant feelings of \ncheerfulness and joy." 6 They had their own martyr, a literary sister \nwho wrote the gospel of their sect, The Mirror of Free Souls. She and \nher book both were excommunicated and burned in 1 3 10 a.d. 7 \n\nAntinomian ideas were often defined as heresy, as in the case of \nSimon Morin, who seems to have had fairly standard delusions of \ngrandeur. He said he was the incarnate second coming of Christ, and \nwas incapable of committing a sin; anything he did must be wor- \nshipped. The church disagreed, and burned him as a witch. 8 \n\nThe usual Antinomian excuses for sexual self-expression infiltrated \na group of nuns in the Dominican convent of St. Catherine de Prato. \nEarly in the 19th century, a text of the official inquiry into this case was \npublished in Brussels, then "withdrawn at the insistence of the Papal \nCourt. The second edition is . . . much expurgated." One of the nuns \nexpounded on her Antinomian teachings: "It is sufficient to elevate \nthe spirit to God and then no action, whatever it be, is sinful. . . . Love \nof God and one\'s neighbor is the whole of the commandments. Man \nwho unites with God by means of woman satisfies both command- \nments. So also does he who, lifting his spirit to God, has enjoyment \nwith a person of the same sex or alone. ... In doing that which we \nerroneously call impure is real purity ordained by God, without \nwhich man cannot arrive at a knowledge of Him." 9 \n\nSuch ideas were typically Oriental, as opposed to the Christian idea \n\nof entering into a relationship with a God who was an external \n\n"other." Though the Gospels said "the kingdom of God is within you" \n\n(Luke 17:21), orthodox Christianity treated this as a heretical idea. 10 \n\n1. Angus, 106. 2. Angus, 102, 108, 1 10, 1 12. 3.

Mated to Nephthys, the underground aspect of Isis, Anubis \nwas sometimes known as the Great Dog. He was considered essential to \nthe worship of Isis and Osiris. Plutarch said he had "a power among \n\n\n\n42 \n\n\n\nthe Egyptians much like that of Hecate among the Greeks, he being ter- \nrestrial as well as Olympic Those that worship the dog, have a \n\ncertain secret meaning that must not be revealed.

Her symbol was the cowrie, always emblematic of \nfemale genitals. Her union with the ithyphallic god was supposed to \nbring life-giving Nile waters to the land. She "clasped" a number of \ngods, including in the 5 th century b.c. the Hebrew Jehovah. 1 \n\nLike Kali Ma in India, Anuket had four arms, representing union \nbetween male and female principles. The general pattern for such \ndeities was that two arms held symbols of the male elements, and two \nheld symbols of the female elements. Yet she was known as "The \nOne." She was "self-begotten and self-produced, and whilst yet a virgin \ngave birth to the sun god." 2 \n\nAt the Festival of the Inundation, Egyptians sang to her: "Thou \nart the bringer of food, thou art the mighty one of meat and drink, \nthou art the creator of all good things. Thou fillest the storehouses; thou \nheapest high with corn the granaries, and thou hast care for the poor \nand needy." 3 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 405; Lamusse, 37. 2. Budge, D.N., 159. 3.

However, the Serpent was a common \npersonification of the Egyptian underworld or Tuat itself. The realm \nof darkness with its various "chambers" was the interior of the serpent\'s \nbody, through which the sun god must pass, as he was always \nswallowed at each sunset. 1 \n\nIn medieval alchemy the "Apophis-snake" was confused with the \nHermetic Ouroboros, a hidden world spirit in the form of a serpent, \nwho might reveal the secret of the Philosopher\'s Stone. \n\n1.

It has been shown that "In the symbolism of dreams and of \nmyths the hat is usually the phallus." 2 \n\nThe Flamen\'s wife, the Flaminica, represented the Goddess. She \nwas the more important dignitary of the two. If his marriage was \nterminated by her death, the Flamen immediately lost his sacred office \nand reverted to a private citizen. Such customs show that the powers \nof priests "in Rome as elsewhere, derived in the first instance from an \nolder priesthood of magical women." 3 \n\nThe same conical cap belonged to the Lord of the Underworld in \nCeltiberian pagan imagery. He was Helman: a man belonging to the \nGoddess Hel. 4 Sometimes he was said to be the god Frey, consort of \nHel\'s heavenly or lunar aspect, Freya. 5 \n\nThe same conical cap evolved into the traditional headdress of sor- \ncerers and witches; the Fool\'s Cap (or Dunce Cap) worn by the \nCarnival King; the bishop\'s miter; the pope\'s tiara; and before them all, \nthe conical crown of Egyptian pharaohs, emblem of the king\'s union \nwith the Sky-goddess.

Like Kali, she was a Virgin-Mother-Crone \ntrinity. She was once indistinguishable from the Fates (Moirai); her \nold name was Moira, and she was said to be older than Time. She gov- \nerned the world by ius naturale, the natural law of the maternal clan. 1 \n\nShe was not only Greek. She was the Dea Syria, also known as \nAsherah or Astarte, Goddess of the oldest continuously-occupied \ntemple in the world. 2 She was the ancestral mother of the Romans, for \nshe gave birth to their founding father, Aeneas. 3 Under the name of \nVenus, she was the mother of the Venetii, whose capital city became \nVenice, called "Queen of the Sea" after the Goddess herself. \n\nOne of Aphrodite\'s major centers of worship was the city of \nPaphos on Cyprus, the island named for its copper mines. Thus, she \nwas called "the Cyprian" or "the Paphian," and her sacred metal was \ncopper. She was also called Mari, the Sea. Egyptians referred to her \nisland as Ay-Mari. 4 \n\nDuring the Christian era, Aphrodite\'s temple on Cyprus was \nconverted into a sanctuary of the virgin Mary, another name of the \nsame Goddess, but in this sanctuary the virgin Mary is hailed to this day \nas Panaghia Aphroditessa, "All-holy Aphrodite." 5 \n\n\n\n44 \n\n\n\nContinued worship of the goddess on Cyprus probably contributed Apis \n\nto the Christian belief that the whole population of Cyprus descend- \ned from demons. 6 In reality, Cyprian Aphrodite was like all other ^^^^^^^^ \nmanifestations of the Great Goddess: ruling birth, life, love, death \ntime, and fate, reconciling man to all of them through sensual and \nsexual mysticism. The Cyprian sage Zenon taught Aphrodite\'s phi- \nlosophy: "mankind and the universe were bound together in the system \n\nof fate Diogenes Laertios tells us that Zenon was the first to \n\ndefine the end of human existence as \'life in accordance with nature.\' " 7 \n\nAphrodite had almost as many "emanations" as Thousand-Named \nKali. She was not only Mari and Moira and Marina and Pelagia and \nStella Maris, all titles related to her control of the sea; she was also \nIlithyia, Goddess of childbirth; Hymen, Goddess of marriage; Venus, \nGoddess of sexuality and the hunt; Urania, Queen of Heaven; Andro- \nphonos, the Destroyer of Men; and many others. She was often \nidentified with Isis. Anchises, her lover who begot Aeneas and then was \ncastrated, had a name meaning "he who mates with Isis." 8 Under \nseveral of her names, Aphrodite mated with Semitic gods. Her cult \noccupied the main temple in Jerusalem after 70 a.d. In the 4th \ncentury it was said that Constantine\'s mother found the true cross of \nChrist buried in Aphrodite\'s Jerusalem temple. (See Cross.) \n\nOne of Aphrodite\'s greatest shrines in Asia Minor was the city of \nAphrodisias, once dedicated to Ishtar. Up to the 12th century a.d., \nwhen the city was taken by Seljuk Turks, the Goddess was worshipped \nthere as the patron of arts and letters, crafts, and culture. 9 Recent \nexcavations have uncovered exquisite artifacts and statuary, bespeaking \na cultivated and sophisticated lifestyle under the Goddess\'s rule. 10 \n\nThe calendar still keeps the name of Aphrodite on the month \ndedicated to her, April (Aphrilis). The ancient Kalendar of Romulus \nsaid this was the month of Venus. 11 \n\n1. Bachofen, 57, 192. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Byblos." 3. Graves, G.M. 1, 69. \n4. Graves, W.G., 410. 5. Ashe, 192. 6.

Apis was begotten in bull form when moon- \nbeams fell on a cow in heat. He was identified by special markings, \nnotably symbols of the Goddess: a triangle on his forehead, a flying \nvulture on his side, a crescent moon on his flank. After death each Apis \nbull was elaborately embalmed and buried in the vast underground \nbull-tombs. 1 In mummy form, like all Egyptian gods, he became "an \nOsiris." \n\n\n\n1 . Larousse, 44. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n45 \n\n\n\nApollo Apollo \n\nGreek sun god who took over the powers of his twin sister Artemis, \n^^^^^^^^^^^ the Moon. Originally, he was her child, as the sun was born of \n\nthe Moon-goddess in Egypt and elsewhere. He was also her totemic \nbeast in several forms: a wolf (Apollo Lycaeus), a mouse (Apollo \nSmintheus), or a golden-maned lion (Apollo Chrysocomes). \n\nThe fully anthropomorphized Apollo laid claim to the Goddess\'s \npowers of prophecy, poetry, music, magic, and healing. His priest- \nhood adopted the Muses, the Graces, even the Great Serpent who gave \noracles from the earth-womb, Apollo Python, known as Sol Niger \n(Black Sun) during his nightly sojourn in the underworld. Egyptians \ncalled him Apep or Apophis, the serpent of darkness. In the Bible he \nis Apollyon, "Spirit of the Pit" (Revelation 9:1 1). \n\nApollo\'s serpent-form inspired the Pythoness, priestess of the \nDelphic oracle, Greece\'s foremost temple of prophecy. This temple \nbelonged to the Goddess in the beginning; delphi means womb. Even \nApollo\'s priests admitted that she had owned the oracle in her \ntrinitarian guise as mother of earth, heaven, and the abyss: the first of all \ndeities to prophesy, the Earth-mother; and Themis, mother of the sea \nand of all Themistes, "oracles"; and the Moon-goddess, Artemis, under \nthe name of Phoebe another title stolen by Apollo, who became \nknown as Phoebus. 1 \n\nApollonian priests naturally directed their energies toward con- \nquest of the oracles. "The reason why a deity associated with political \nconquest and order should take possession of oracular shrines is obvious; \noracles were the chief means of controlling public opinion and public \naction, and to control the oracles was as necessary to a political god as it \nis to later politicians to control the press or education." 2 \n\nLaurel became Apollo\'s sacred plant because it was the plant of \ninspired poetic frenzy, which is why Britain\'s national poet is still \ncalled Laureate, the laurel-crowned one. The Delphic Pythoness \nchewed leaves of cherry laurel to induce her poetic-prophetic trances. \nCherry laurel contains traces of cyanide, enough to cause delirium, \nfoaming at the mouth, and other symptoms of divine possession. \n\nApollo\'s priests used the oracles to create new patriarchal laws, \noverturning the laws of the matriarchate. Apollo\'s most notable \njudicial act was to absolve Orestes from the crime of killing his mother. \nApollo said it was no crime, because a mother is not a real parent; \nonly a father truly gives life to a child, the same "Apollonian" opinion \nlater adopted by Christian theologians. 3 Yet this patriarchal opinion \nwas negated by Apollo\'s own surname of Letoides, "son of Leto." 4 He \ncarried the name of his mother only, after the custom of the matri- \narchal Lycians who recognized strictly matrilineal ancestry, and in \nwhose country Apollo\'s cult first evolved. \n\nIn his earliest manifestations, Apollo was subordinate to the God- \ndess as her dog-faced or wolf-faced door-guardian: a "Spirit of the \nPit" like Apollyon, another name for Anubis or Cerberus. Four Hittite \n\n\n\n46 \n\n\n\naltars found in Anatolia were dedicated to a god named Apulunas, \nGuardian of Gates, forerunner of Apollo Lycaeus or "Wolfish Apol- \nlo." 5 Once he walked at the Goddess\'s heel, like Anubis; but this \nwas suppressed and forgotten. \n\nTo some early Christians, Apollo became a junior God. He was \neven said to have fathered on mortal virgins several pagan sages \nrespected by the church, such as Plato. 6 Healing miracles were widely \nattributed to Apollo. 7 Christians sought his intervention in certain \nillnesses. It was claimed that if a naked virgin touched the afflicted part, \nsaying, "Apollo denieth that the heat of the plague can increase \nwhere a naked virgin quencheth it," the patient would get well. 8 \n\nUnder his title of Benedictus, "Good-speaker," Apollo was even \ncanonized, and became St. Benedict. 9 \n\n1.

When he went through the streets, the people came forth \nto worship him, and every one brought him an alms, with children and \nsick folks, that he might cure them, and bless them, suffering him to do all \nthings at his pleasure, only he was accompanied with ten or twelve men \nlest he should fly. . . . The feast being come, and he grown fat, they killed \nhim, opened him, and ate him, making a solemn sacrifice of him. \' \n\nThis devoured Savior, closely watched by his ten or twelve \nguards, embodied the god Quetzalcoatl, who was born of a virgin, slain \nin atonement for a primal sin, and whose Second Coming was \nconfidently expected. 2 He was often represented as a trinity signified by \nthree crosses, a large one between the smaller ones. 5 Father Acosta \nnaively said, "It is strange that the devil after his manner hath brought a \nTrinity into idolatry." 4 His church found it all too familiar, and long \nkept his book as one of its secrets. \n\nThe Gospels contain hints that Jesus was as reluctant as the \nQuetzalcoatl-victim. Once he ran away from his "apostles" and fled \nalone into the mountains, fearing men would "come and take him by \nforce, to make him a king" (John 6:1 5). That is, he didn\'t want the \nfatal honor of being a sacred king of the Jews, the doomed Bridegroom \nof Zion. The apostles caught up with him in Capernaum, and his \nsubsequent speeches indicate resignation to his fate. \n\nHe said he was the bread of God, come down from heaven to give \nlife to the world: "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will \ngive for the life of the world Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh \n\n\n\nJose de Acosta \n\n16th-century Spanish \nJesuit missionary who \naccompanied the \nconquistadores, and \nwrote a history of \nnative cultures in Peru, \nBolivia, and Mexico. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\nApotheosis my blood, hath eternal life" (John 6:50, 54). On the eve of the \n\nApple sacrifice he prayed despairingly, "O my Father, if it be possible, let \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ this cup pass from me; nevertheless . . . thy will be done" (Matthew \n26:39, 42). At least the Gospel narrator claims Jesus said this. \n\nNaturally, any sacred king\'s guards would become popularizers of \nhis cult, "dining out" on the divine sayings and actions for years. \nHowever, the Gospels were not written by the apostles whose names \nthey bear. They were forgeries, compiled long after Jesus\'s time, \nsome as late as the middle of the 2nd century. 5 Even this is scholarly \nguesswork, since no authentic manuscript can be dated before the 4th \ncentury. 6 \n\nCanonization of the apostles used an ancient Buddhist symbol, the \nushnisha or "flame of invisible light" appearing on top of their heads. \nTo Buddhists, this flame streaming from the "lotus center" of the skull \nmeant super-intelligence. It appeared over the heads of bodhisattvas. 7 \nThe same phenomenon appeared over the heads of the apostles (Acts \n2:4). The rest of their stories were as mythical as those of the \nbodhisattvas. Guignebert says "not one of them is true. . . . [Tjhere \nexists no information really worthy of credence about the life and \nwork of the immediate Apostles of Jesus." 8 \n\nl.Frazer,G.B.,680. 2.

It became a custom to apotheosize Roman emperors while \nthey were still living. Most other ancient kings were also gods on earth. \nTheir surrogates, the "sacred kings" who died in their place, were \npromised immediate godhood after death. \n\nApotheosis was similarly promised Christian martyrs who perished \nin the belief that they would be wholly assimilated to Christ and \nwould sit "on the right hand of God" like him. The church\'s ritual of \ncanonization was a direct copy of pagan ceremonies of apotheosis. \nThe Roman emperors\' souls winging to heaven as eagles contributed \nthe idea of releasing white doves at the climax of the church\'s \ncanonization ceremony. 1 See Drama. \n\nl.Gaster,769. \n\n\n\nApple \n\nEve\'s fruit of knowledge used to be the Goddess\'s sacred heart of \nimmortality, all over the Indo-European culture complex. The God- \ndess\'s many western paradises grew the apples of eternal life. The \n\n\n\n48 \n\n\n\nCelts called the western paradise Avalon, "Apple-land," a country ruled Apple \n\nby Morgan, the queen of the dead. Irish kings received the Goddess\'s \n\nmagic apples of immortality and went away to live with her under the ^^^^^_^_^^ \n\nsunset. King Arthur was taken to Avalon by the Triple Goddess in \n\nperson, as three fairy queens. \n\nScandinavians thought apples essential to resurrection, and placed \nvessels of them in graves. 1 The Norse Goddess Idun kept the magic \napple-land in the west, where the gods received the fruit that kept them \ndeathless. 2 Apples carried souls from one body to the next. Sigurd\'s \nor Siegfried\'s great-grandmother conceived by eating an apple. 3 The \nYule pig was roasted with an apple in its mouth, to serve as a heart in \nthe next life (see Boar). \n\nGreeks said Mother Hera kept the magic apple garden in the west, \nwhere the Tree of Life was guarded by her sacred serpent. Graves \npoints out that the whole story of Eve, Adam, and the serpent in the \ntree was deliberately misinterpreted from icons showing the Great \nGoddess offering life to her worshipper, in the form of an apple, with \nthe tree and its serpent in the background. Similarly, Hellenes \nmisinterpreted icons of the hero-victim receiving an apple from the \nTriple Goddess, before his journey to paradise, as the Judgment \nof Paris: a picture of a young man receiving the apple from three \nGoddesses, not vice versa. 4 \n\nRomans gave the apple-mother the name of Pomona, which was \nprobably inherited from the Etruscans. She symbolized all fruition. A \nRoman banquet always progressed ab ovo usque mala, from eggs to \napples beginning with the symbol of creation and ending with the \nsymbol of completion. It was recorded that King Herod finished every \nmeal in the Roman style, with an apple. 5 \n\nOne reason for the extreme reverence paid to this fruit is revealed \nby cutting it transversely, as the gypsies and witches did. Hidden in \nthe apple\'s core was the magic pentacle, or sign of Kore (Core). Just as \nKore the Virgin was hidden in the heart of Mother Earth (Demeter) \nand represented the World Soul, so her pentacle was hidden in the \napple. \n\nThe five-pointed star in a circle was the Egyptian hieroglyph for \nthe underworld womb, where resurrection was brought about by the \nmother-heart of "transformations." 6 In Christian iconography also, this \napple-sign represented the Virgin concealed within the Mother, like \nKore within Demeter. (See Anne, Saint.) \n\nAmong gypsies, "occult couples" carefully cut the apple to reveal \nits pentacle and ate it together as magical nourishment during Tannic \nintercourse. 7 A gypsy maiden was supposed to bring about her partner s \nmystic union with the soul of the earth through her own body; thus \nshe was a Shakti, and the apple was her sexual symbol. It was a custom \nfor a gypsy girl to choose her lover by tossing an apple at him, just as \nKali-Shakti chose Shiva to be her doomed bridegroom. 8 \n\nIn Celtic paganism the Goddess\'s apple similarly signified a sacred \n\n\n\n49 \n\n\n\nApple \n\n\n\nVolsungs Teutonic \nclan of demigods \nfavored by Odin, \nwho used a magic apple \nto impregnate the \nmother of the original \nVolsung. His \ndescendant Sigurd is \nbetter known as \nSiegfried, hero of the \nGermanic Ring of \nthe Nibelung. \n\n\n\nmarriage and a journey to the land of death. Queen Guinevere, who \nwas really the Triple Goddess, according to the Welsh Triads, gave a \nmagic apple to "the Irish knight Sir Patrice," actually St. Patrick, \nformerly the father-god or Pater. 9 (See Patrick, Saint.) The Irish \nknight died; Guinevere was denounced as a witch and condemned to \nthe stake, from which Lancelot rescued her. Her offense was choosing a \nsacred king in the ancient ceremonial style. Pre-Christian legends \nshow that each king who ruled Britain had to be chosen by the Triple \nGoddess, and later slain by her Crone form, Morgan, lady of the \nblood-red pentacle and keeper of the Apple-Isle in the west. 10 \n\nHalloween apple-games descended from Celtic feasts of Samhain, \nthe Feast of the Dead at the end of October. Catching at apples \nsuspended from strings, or bobbing in water, may have invoked hanged \nor drowned witches. The games hinted at cheating Death in the form \nof Cerridwen, another name for Morgan as a Sow-goddess. At the end \nof the game, all players ran away "to escape from the black short- \ntailed sow." 11 \n\nHalloween apples were also used for divination, as if they were \noracular ghosts called up from the underworld. Such magic was \nespecially associated with women, harking back to the pagan tradition of \nfemale control of the spirits in that world. The Volsung cycle showed \nthat a man must be provided with "apples of Hel" by his wife, whose \ngift had the power to preserve him when he died and descended \nunder the earth. 12 Thus, Halloween apples were often linked with \nmarriage. One who peeled an apple before a candlelit mirror on \nHalloween would see the image of a future spouse. 13 \n\nApple blossoms were wedding flowers because they represented \nthe Virgin form of the Goddess whose maturity produced the fruit. \nAs the pagan symbols were Christianized, Apple-Eve-Mother-Goddess \nwas said to be reborn as her own younger aspect, Rose-Mary- Virgin- \nGoddess: the five-petaled rose and apple blossom often mystically \ncombined. The red and white Alchemical Rose was an allegory of the \nVirgin Mother. 14 Some mystics said Mary, called the Holy Rose, \nhad invented alchemy. 15 \n\nHowever, the dangerous aspect of apples associated with the \nGoddess as Mother Death were never forgotten. Since she was not \nonly the Virgin and the Mother but also Hel, or Hecate, her apples \nwere often depicted in Christian folklore as poisoned. Churchmen \ndeclared that a witch could cause demonic possession through her gift of \nan apple to her intended victim. 16 Old women were slain for giving \nan apple to a child or other person who later became afflicted with fits. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 187. 2.

The Annals of Ashurbani- \npal said Arabia was governed by queens for as long as anyone could \nremember. 1 The land\'s original Allah was Al-Lat, part of the female \ntrinity along with Kore or Q\'re, the Virgin, and Al-Uzza, the \nPowerful One, the triad known as Manat, the Threefold Moon. 2 \n\nAt Mecca the Goddess was Shaybah or Sheba, the Old Woman, \nworshipped as a black aniconic stone like the Goddess of the Scyth- \nian Amazons. 3 The same Black Stone now enshrined in the Kaaba at \nMecca was her feminine symbol, marked by the sign of the yoni, and \ncovered like the ancient Mother by a veil. 4 No one seems to know \nexactly what it is supposed to represent today. \n\nThe Black Stone rests in the Haram, "Sanctuary," cognate of \n"harem," which used to mean a Temple of Women: in Babylon, a \nshrine of the Goddess Har, mother of harlots. 5 Hereditary guardians \nof the Haram were the Koreshites, "Children of Kore," Mohammed\'s \nown tribe. 6 The holy office was originally held by women, before it was \ntaken over by male priests calling themselves Beni Shaybah, "Sons of \nthe Old Woman." 7 \n\nMohammed\'s legends clearly gave him a matriarchal family \nbackground. His parents\' marriage was matrilocal. His mother remained \nwith her own family and received her husband as an occasional \nvisitor. Mohammed lived with his mother until her death, because she \nwas his true parent according to the ancient system; "children \nbelonged to the woman\'s family . . . paternity in the biological sense was \nrelatively unimportant." 8 She may well have been one of the "aged \npriestesses" who served the temple in Mecca. 9 The traditions of such \npriestesses may well date back to Assyro- Babylonian um-mati or \n"mothers," the only people permitted to enter the Holy of Holies. \nArchaic Arabian shrines were usually served by seven high priest- \nesses, recalling the lawgiving Seven Sages, who were women. 10 The \nfirst collection of the books of law called Koran the Word of Kore, \nor Q\'re was attributed to them. \n\nPre-Islamic Arabia was dominated by the female-centered clans. \nMarriages were matrilocal, inheritance matrilineal. Polyandry \nseveral husbands to one wife was common. Men lived in their wives\' \nhomes. Divorce was initiated by the wife. If she turned her tent to \nface east for three nights in a row, the husband was dismissed and for- \nbidden to enter the tent again. 11 \n\nDoctrines attributed to Mohammed simply reversed the ancient \nsystem in favor of men. A Moslem husband could dismiss his wife by \nsaying "I divorce thee" three times. As in Europe, the change from \nmatriarchate to patriarchate came about only gradually and with \nmuch strife. \n\n\n\nArabia \n\n\n\nAnnals of \n\nAshurbanipal Assyrian \nroyal chronicles on \ncuneiform tablets, \ndating from the 7th \ncentury B.C., found in \nthe king\'s famous \nlibrary at Nineveh by \n19th-century \narcheologists. \n\n\n\nSeven Sages Legendary \nfigures in both Greek \nand Arabian lore, \nidentified with a variety \nof seers and \nphilosophers, the \nearliest ones usually \nfemale, confused with \nthe Seven Sisters, or \nPleiades. \n\n\n\nSI \n\n\n\nArabia \n\n\n\nShi\'ites Minority sect \nof Islam, tracing \ndescent of a sacred \ncaliphate from \nMohammed\'s daughter \nFatima and her \nhusband \'Ali. One line \nof Shi\'ites established \nthe powerful Fatimid \ncaliphate, now \nrepresented by the \nKhojas, Bohras, and \nthe Druze of Syria. \n\n\n\nMany Koreshites remained faithful to the Goddess and to their \nqueen, Hind al-Hunud: the Hind of Hinds, similar to the title of \nArtemis. She was also called Lady of Victory. But her victories came to \nan end with one of the last queens, whose husband betrayed her and \nsurrendered her city of Makkah to the enemy. \n\nLegend claims the step-daughter of the divine Hind married \nMohammed himself. 12 However, the history of early-medieval Arabia \nis nearly all legend. Like Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, and other founders \nof patriarchal religions, Mohammed lacks real verification. There is \nno reliable information about his life or teachings. Most stories about \nhim are as apocryphal as the story that his coffin hangs forever in \nmid-air "between heaven and earth," like the bodies of ancient sacred \nkings. 13 \n\nWith or without Mohammed, Islam succeeded in becoming com- \npletely male-dominated, making no place for women except in \nslavery or in the seclusion of the harem. Islamic mosques still bear signs \nreading: "Women and dogs and other impure animals are not \npermitted to enter." H \n\nNevertheless, traces of the Goddess proved ineradicable. Like the \nvirgin Mary, Arabia\'s Queen of Heaven received a mortal form and a \nsubordinate position as Fatima, Mohammed\'s "daughter." But she was \nno real daughter. She was known as Mother of her Father, and \nSource of the Sun: "the illumination that separates Light and Darkness; \nthe Tree of Paradise; the Red Cow who suckles all the children of the \nearth; Fate; the Night, the World; the Moon; the Pure Essence of \nBeing." 15 Like her western counterpart Mary, she was compared to \nthe Burning Bush, and the Night of Power; "she personified the center \nof the genealogical mystery." 16 \n\nFatima\'s name means The Creatress. A Shi\'a text, Omm-al-Kitab, \nsaid she appeared "at the creation of the material world," crowned, \nseated on a throne, holding a sword, and "ornamented with a million \nvaricolored shimmering lights" which illuminated the entire garden of \nParadise. She was the first to occupy the Seat of Dominion, "the \nresting place of Allah, the Most High." 17 Her symbol as Holy Virgin, \nthe crescent moon, still appears on Islamic flags. 18 She is called Al- \nZahra, "Bright-Blooming," a former title of the Great Mother. It is \nsaid the symbol of her hand, surmounting the solar disc, "represents the \nwhole religion of Islam." 19 \n\nWithin Islam, deviant sects like Shi\'ites or Sufis carried on Tantric \nworship of the female principle, maintaining that the feminine \npowers of sexuality and maternity were the powers that held the \nuniverse together. 20 The greatest medieval poet of Sufism, Ibn al- \nFarid, was known as "the sultan of lovers." 21 He said true divinity was \nfemale, and Mecca was the womb of the earth. As woman-worship- \nping minstrels of medieval Europe were attacked for their devotion to the \nGoddess of Love, so the Sufis were attacked for their "voluptuous \n\n\n\n52 \n\n\n\nlibertinism." Ibn El-Arabi, the "greatest master" of Sufi mystics, was Arabia \n\naccused of blasphemy because he said the godhead is female. 22 \n\nShi\'ites split off from orthodox Islam and claimed to follow a purer ___^_^_^_ \nline of imams directly descended from the Fatimids. In the 1 1th \ncentury they united under Hasan ibn al-Sabbah, i.e., Hasan ben- \nShaybah, another "son of the Matriarch." Hasan seized the fortress \nof Alamut and made it the headquarters of a brotherhood of warriors, \nthe hashishim or "Assassins" (see Aladdin). The fortress fell to the \nconcerted attacks of Mongols and Mamelukes in 1256, after having \nwaged war on Turks and Christian crusaders alike for more than a \ncentury. 23 \n\nStill the Shi\'ite sect survived to the present, awaiting the coming of \nthe Virgin named Paradise (Pairidaeza), who will give birth to the \nMahdi, the "moon-guided" Redeemer, whose title in Europe was the \nDesired Knight. 24 \n\nOne of the hidden secrets of medieval bardic romance is the \nArabian origin of the Waste Land motif, most prominent in the Holy \nGrail cycle of tales. Despite monkish efforts to convert it into a \nChristian chalice, the Grail was generally recognized as a female \nsymbol, whose loss implied fear for the fertility of the earth. Crusad- \ners had seen for themselves the desolation of Arabia Deserta, one of the \nmost lifeless regions on earth. They heard the Shi\'ite heretics\' \nexplanation for it: Islam had offended the Great Goddess, and she \nhad cursed the land and departed. Now nothing would grow there. \n\nWestern mystics thought the same calamity would strike Europe \nif the spirit of the Mother were not brought back from the limbo to \nwhich the Christian church consigned her. This may have been a \nreason for the frenzy of cathedral-building in honor of "Our Lady," the \nQueen of Heaven, during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Waste \nLand theme haunted the collective psyche of the early Renaissance with \na threat of conditions actually realized in the land of the infidel. \n\nTraces of the matriarchate survived to the present among some of \nthe Arabs of North Africa, ancient home of "Libyan Amazons." 25 \nTargi and Tuareg Berber women remained free of many sexual \nrestrictions. Virginity was not prized. On remarriage, a woman could \ncommand twice the bride-price of a young virgin. Men of the \nWalad \'Abdi tribe insisted the success of their crops depended on the \nsexual freedom of their women, whom the French labeled common \nprostitutes. Hassanyeh Arabs of the White Nile allowed wives to be \nunfaithful on certain days of the week, according to the marriage \ncontract drawn up by the bride\'s mother who took pride in preserving \nher daughter\'s sexual liberties. 27 Most of Islam, however, restricted \nwomen as much as possible. Many Islamic theologians said women \ncouldn\'t enter paradise, and must not receive religious instruction \nbecause it might bring them "too near their masters." 28 \n\nl.Assyr. & Bab.

Graves, CM. 1, 347; 2, 381. \n\n\n\nAriana \n\nArchaic name of Iran and its Great Goddess, sometimes rendered \nMariana. \n\n\n\nArianism \n\nEarly Christian heresy founded by Arius in the 4th century a.d. The \nbasic tenet of Arianism was that God was not a trinity but a unit or \nmonad. \n\nOrphics and other mystery-cultists of the early Christian era \nmaintained the classic trinitarian pattern laid down thousands of years \nbefore by the Triple Goddess. They said: "All things are made by one \ngodhead in three names, and this god is all things." From the \nmystery-cults, some Christians picked up the idea that their deity too \nshould be a trinity. Other Christians objected, saying their deity must \nbe a monad like the Jewish Jehovah. St. Augustine found the notion of a \ntrinity incomprehensible. He scoffed at his pagan neighbors for \ncalling their Great Goddess three persons and one person at the same \ntime. 1 \n\nNeither the Old nor the New Testament mentioned a triune God, \nso early Pauline Christians worshipped God as one individual. How- \never, this monotheistic idea was abandoned at the 4th-century Council \nof Nicaea. Arian Christians, clinging to the Hebraic belief in an \nundivided God, suddenly found themselves labeled heretics. In increas- \ningly acrimonious battles, partisans of one viewpoint or the other \nengaged in street fighting with stones and clubs, bloodying their oppo- \nnents to prove the nature of their deity. 2 \n\nArius\'s objections to the Holy Trinity were basically logical. He \ninsisted that a divine son couldn\'t have co-existed eternally with his \nown divine father. There must have been a time when the father existed \nalone, before bringing the son into being. But Arius\'s opponents \nwanted to be assured that, in assimilating the body and blood of Christ \nin communion, they partook of an infinite divinity who had existed \n\n\n\n55 \n\n\n\nArianrhod from the beginning of time. Otherwise they might be robbed of immor- \n\ntality, through unwise identification with a lesser, finite power. \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Therefore they insisted that Christ and God were one and the same. \n\nBesides, pagan traditions universally supported the notion that \ndivine fathers and sons were identical with each other, cyclically \nalternating and united through the Mother. Proponents of the trinitar- \nian theory borrowed myths and symbols from the pagans, and said \nwhen the Magi saw the star in the east announcing Christ\'s birth, three \nsuns appeared in the sky and fused into one. 3 \n\nThe emperor Constantine I at first defended Arius, because he \nliked the idea of a single supreme deity whom he might identify with \nhimself. He also disliked the Christians\' incessant sectarian strife. He \nwrote to Bishop Alexander: "I am sending to you, not simply suggest- \ning, but imploring that you will take these men (the Arians) back . . . \nthat there is peace and concord among you all." 4 This was ignored. \n\nThe Council decided that God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost were \none and the same, forever co-existent, equally potent. Arius was \nanathematized and driven into exile. At last he succumbed to a dose of \npoison, apparently administered by one of his trinitarian opponents. 5 \nBut the battle was not over. The Arian controversy dragged on for \nmany centuries, and spilled much blood, as theological arguments \nwere wont to do in those days. \n\nAfter 360 a.d., Arianism was carried by missionaries to the Ger- \nmanic tribes, whose Christianity remained a vaguely Arian semi- \npaganism up to the time of Charlemagne and beyond. 6 Arianism came \nto the surface again in Hungary and Transylvania during the 16th \ncentury. Christian writers then denied the trinity altogether, starting a \nmovement that led ultimately to the foundation of Unitarian churches. 7 \n\nl.Briffault3,90. 2. de Camp, A.E., 282. 3.de Voragine,49. \n\n4.

In \nMesopotamia and Egypt, the sun god was generally considered a child \n)f the moon-, earth-, sea-, or heaven-goddess. \n\n\n\nArinna \nArk \n\n\n\nVrk of the Covenant \n\n)n its earliest appearances in the Bible, the ark of the covenant was so \nacer (taboo, dangerous) that it would kill at a touch. While it was \neing transported on an oxcart, it teetered "because the oxen shook \n:" and would have fallen, had not Uzzah "put forth his hand to the ark \nif God, and took hold of it" (2 Samuel 6:3). In spite of Uzzah\'s good \nitentions, God instantly struck him dead for daring to touch the \nloly object. \n\nAgain, when the ark returned from Philistia, God perpetrated an \nxtraordinary slaughter of 50,070 well-intentioned people for daring \n3 look inside the ark in their joy: "And he smote the men of \nlethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even \ne smote of tlfe people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and \nle people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the \neople with a great slaughter" (1 Samuel 6:19). \n\nEven priests feared the power of the ark, and resorted to ritual \n/ashing before approaching it, "that they die not" (Exodus 30:20). \nVater was a common prophylactic charm against the destructive power \nf holy things. Philon of Byzantium said all the "ancients" used water \n)r ritual purification before entering temples; they also spun prayer- \n\'heels made of Aphrodite\'s sacred metal, copper. 1 \n\nFor some reason God lost interest in his ark by Jeremiah\'s time: \nSaith the Lord, they shall say no more, the ark of the covenant of \nle Lord: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; \neither shall it be magnified any more" (Jeremiah 3:16). \n\nThe probable cause of God\'s change of heart was a reform \nlovement to purge the temple of sexual symbols. The arks or cistae of \nle Greeks and Syrians held emblems of the lingam-yoni, such as eggs \nnd serpents, clay or dough models of genitalia. Rabbinical tradition \nlid the ark contained a hexagram representing the sexual union of God \nnd Goddess, the same meaning given to the hexagram in India. 2 \n\'hus the ark was a female container for a male god. Mary, God\'s \nDnsort in her later form, often received the title of "Ark." \n\nSemitic Arek, "ark," descended from Hindu Argha, "great ship," \nletaphorically the Great Yoni: a female-sexual vessel bearing seeds \nf life through the sea of chaos between destruction of one cosmos and \nreation of the next. 3 From the same root came "arcane," literally a \nark or crescent phase of the moon. The crescent moon boat symbol- \ned the Goddess\'s spirit dancing on her primordial uterine Ocean of \n\n\n\nvar.

H.Smith, 227. \n\n\n\nArtemis \n\nAmazonian Moon-goddess, worshipped at Ephesus under the Latin \nname of Diana or "Goddess-Anna." Like the Hindu Goddess Saranyu \nwho gave birth to all animals, she was called Mother of Creatures. \nHer image at Ephesus had a whole torso covered with breasts, to show \nthat she nurtured all living things. Yet she was also the Huntress, \nkiller of the very creatures she brought forth. 1 In Sparta her name was \ngiven as Artamis, "Cutter," or "Butcher." 2 \n\nArtemis\'s myths extend back to Neolithic sacrificial customs. At \nTaurus her holy women, under their high priestess Iphigeneia, \nsacrificed all men who landed on their shores, nailing the head of each \nvictim to a cross. 3 At Hierapolis, the Goddess\'s victims were hung on \nartificial trees in her temple. In Attica, Artemis was ritually propitiated \nwith drops of blood drawn from a man\'s neck by a sword, a symbolic \nremnant of former beheadings. Human victims were later replaced by \nbulls, hence the Goddess\'s title Tauropolos, "bull-slayer." 4 \n\nHer Huntress aspect was another form of the destroying Crone or \nwaning moon. Like Hecate, she led the nocturnal hunt; her pries- \ntesses wore the masks of hunting dogs. Alani, "hunting dogs," was the \nGreek name for Scythians who revered Artemis. The mythological \nhunting dogs who tore the Horned God Actaeon to pieces were really \nArtemis\'s sacred bitches. \n\nClassic mythographers pretended that Actaeon committed the sin \nof seeing the chaste virgin Goddess in her bath, and she condemned \n\n\n\nCft \n\n\n\nhim out of offended modesty. Actually, the bath, the nakedness, and the \ntearing to pieces of the sacred king were all part of the drama. In \nbarbarian Germany, the Goddess\'s ritual bath could be witnessed only \nby "men doomed to die." 5 Actaeon\'s deerskin and antlers marked \nhim as the pre-Hellenic stag king, reigning over the sacred hunt for half \na Great Year before he was torn to pieces and replaced by his tanist \n(co-king). In the first century a.d., Artemis\'s priestesses still pursued and \nkilled a man dressed as a stag on the Goddess\'s mountain. 6 Her \ngroves became the "deer-gardens" (German Tiergarten, Swedish Djur- \ngarden), once the scene of venison feasts. \n\nOne of Artemis\'s most popular animal incarnations was the Great \nShe-Bear, Ursa Major, ruler of the stars and protectress of the axis \nmundi, Pole of the World, marked in heaven by the Pole Star at the \ncenter of the small circle described by the constellation Ursa Major. \nHelvetian tribes in the neighborhood of Berne worshipped her as the \nShe-Bear, which is still the heraldic symbol of Berne. The city\'s very \nname means "She-Bear." 7 Sometimes the Helvetians called her Artio, \nshortened to Art by Celtic peoples who coupled her with the bear- \nking Arthur. As Artio\'s Lord of the Hunt, the medieval god of witches \ncame to be known as "Robin son of Art." According to the Irish, Art \nmeant "God," but its earlier connotation was "Goddess" specifically \nthe Bear-Goddess. 8 She was also canonized as a Christian saint, \nUrsula, derived from her Saxon name of Ursel, the She-Bear. \n\nThere was a rather sophisticated astronomical reason for worship- \nping the heavenly She-Bear who followed her track around the Pole \nStar, year by year. It was probably discovered first in the far east. "The \nmonths and seasons are determined by the revolution of Ursa Major. \nThe tail of the constellation pointing to the east at nightfall announces \nthe arrival of spring, pointing to the south the arrival of summer, \npointing to the west the arrival of autumn, and pointing to the north the \narrival of winter. . . . The Great Bear occupies a prominent position \nin the Taoist heavens as the aerial throne of the supreme deity." This \ndeity in Taoist tradition is the Queen of Heaven, Holy Mother Ma \nTsu P\'o, with characteristics similar to those of Artemis. She protects \nseafarers and governs the weather; she is called a virgin, and Matron \nof the Measure; she is a Mother of Mercy who has been compared to \nthe virgin Mary and to the Buddhist Goddess Maritchi. 9 \n\nThe axis mundi was often associated with male gods, as either a \nGreat Serpent or a World Tree more or less recognized as a phallic \nsymbol. Similarly the Little Bear within the circle of the Great Bear was \npictured by the Greeks as Areas, her son (see Callisto). Yet among \nthe oldest traditions may be found hints that this world-supporting tree \nor pole was female. Even as Yggdrasil, the World Tree of the \nVikings, it showed many parallels with birth-giving, fruit- or milk- \nproducing mother trees of the Near East, under its older name of \nMjotvidr or Mutvidr, "Mother-Tree." Sometimes it was Mead-Tree, \nlike "the milk-giving tree of the Finno-Ugric peoples, a symbol which \nmust go back ultimately to Mesopotamia, and be of great antiquity." It \n\n\n\nArtemis \n\n\n\nUrsa Major "Great \nBear," colloquially \ncalled the Big \nDipper, a circumpolar \nconstellation with \nseven bright stars \nincluding the "north \npole pointers." For a \nbrief time the \nconstellation was \nrenamed Charles\'s \nWain, after the chariot \nof Charlemagne. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n\n\nArtha \nArthur \n\n\n\nTatian 2nd-century \nChristian apologist of \nGreek education and \nGnostic leanings.

Its fruit could be given to women \nin childbirth "that what is within may pass out." The spring at the tree\'s \nroot was a fountain of wisdom or of the life-giving fluid aurr, which \nmay be likened to the "wise blood" of the Mother that much- \nmythologized feminine life-source likened to the Kula nectar in the \nuterine spring of Kundalini, as if the maternal tree upholding the \nuniverse were the Mother\'s spine with its many chakras. 10 See \nMenstrual Blood. \n\n"Many-breasted" Artemis was always a patroness of nurture, \nfertility, and birth. Male gods turned against these attributes in \nopposing the cult of the Goddess. Her own twin brother and sometime \nconsort Apollo made birth illegal on his sacred isle of Delos; \npregnant women had to be removed from the island lest they offend the \ngod by giving birth there. 11 Christians continued to vilify Artemis. \nTatian said, "Artemis is a poisoner; Apollo performs cures." 12 The \nGospels demanded destruction of Artemis\'s Ephesian temple (Acts \n19:27). St. John Chrysostom preached against this temple in 406 a.d. \nSoon afterward, it was looted and burned.

See Earth. \n\n\n\nArthur \n\nKing Arthur was the Welsh Arth Vawr, Heavenly Bear. His prede- \ncessor or "father" was Uther Pendragon, "Wonderful Head of the \nDragon." 1 Where did the dragon\'s head precede the bear? At the \nhub of the heavens, which the ancients always anxiously watched. \n\nIn the 3rd millenium b.c, the north pole star was not the present \nPolaris in Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. It was Alpha Draconis, the \nHead of the Dragon. 2 Due to precession of the equinoxes, a slow subtle \nshift of the celestial pole took place over the course of 5000 years. \nHowever difficult it may have been to observe, the ancients seem to \n\n\n\n60 \n\n\n\nhave known about it. India as well as Britain placed the former north \npole in the constellation of the Dragon. The Mahabharata said the pole \nstar, to which "the yoke of the world" was fixed, was the head of the \nGreat Serpent. 3 \n\nGreeks said the little bear-god who replaced the serpent was Areas, \nancestor of the Arcadians. His mother was Artemis Calliste, the \nGreat She-Bear who used to rule all the stars. 4 As Ursa Major, she still \ncircles the pole. Western Europeans called her Artio, Art, Ursel, or \nErcel. 5 Arthur was a Celtic version of her son, spouse, sacred king. \n\nArthur was another humanization of an old pagan god apparent- \nly very old, for he had no credible human parentage but rather many \ncontradictory miraculous-birth myths. Some said he had no father. Like \nthe Norse god Heimdall and the Saxon hero Scyld, he was born of \nthe Ninefold Sea-goddess and cast ashore on the ninth wave, to land at \nMerlin\'s feet. 6 Bulfinch\'s Mythology said Arthur\'s father was Ambro- \nsius, an earlier name for Merlin. \n\nThe story of Uther Pendragon\'s fatherhood of Arthur bears marks \nof strained revision. Arthur\'s royal mother was married to Uther\'s \nrival at the time. Uther was far away, but with Merlin\'s help he sent his \nspirit to her in the guise of her husband, while the latter was being \nkilled. Arthur was begotten at the instant his official father died. He was \ntaken away by Merlin to be raised in a secret place until he came of \nage the cliche secret upbringing of every sacred king\'s career. \n\nArthur\'s mother was really the Triple Goddess, incarnate in the \nqueen as usual. Her three daughters represented herself in triad: \nElaine, the virgin Lily Maid; Margawse, mother of the four Aeons; \nMorgan, Queen of the Shades. Arthur later coupled with his sister \nMargawse and incestuously begot his own son-nephew-supplanter, \nMordred, who was likewise taken away at birth to be raised in hiding. \n\nAs Galahad was the reincarnated Lancelot, so Mordred was the \nreincarnated Arthur, destined to succeed him by both matrilineal and \npatrilineal right, as both sister\'s-son and son. Like all kings threatened by \nthe Oedipal rival, Arthur tried to kill Mordred by a Slaughter of the \nInnocents. He collected all the children born on May Day, the birthday \nof his prophesied supplanter, put them on a ship, and sent them out \nto sea to be wrecked. Of course Mordred survived the wreck and grew \nup to return incognito to Arthur\'s court. 8 \n\nArthur lost his sacred mana when he lost his queen, the Triple \nGoddess incarnate in Guinevere, who was really three Guineveres \naccording to the Welsh Triads. 9 Mordred seized her, thus symbolically \nseizing the kingdom, and brought Arthur to his death. \n\nWhen Arthur died, the same Triple Goddess took him back into \nthe sea that gave him birth. "Three fairy queens" carried him away to \nthe western isles of paradise, singing his death-song, the kind of song \nWelsh bards called marwysgafen giving-back-to-the-sea-mother. 10 \nThe three fairy queens were really the final triad of the Ninefold \nGoddess, Morgan le Fay and two of her alter egos: the Queen of \n\n\n\nArthur \n\n\n\nMahabharata \n\nIndian epic poem, \nconsisting of historical \nand legendary \nmaterial gathered \nbetween the 4th and \n10th centuries a.d., \nincluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\nWelsh Triads \n\nPoetic literature of pre- \nChristian Wales, drawn \nfrom the bards\' oral \ntradition. \n\nNinefold Goddess \n\nThe triple trinity, as \nexemplified by the \nNine Muses of Greece, \nthe Nine Sisters of \nScandinavia, the Nine \nMorgans of the \nFortunate Isles, etc. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n\n\nAryan \nAsceticism \n\n\n\nBrythonicOfthe \n\nBritish branch of Celts, \nincluding speakers of \nthe Welsh, Cornish, \nand Breton \nlanguages. \n\n\n\nNorthgallis (i.e., North Gaul, or Brittany), and the Queen of the \nWesterlands, which meant the isles of the dead. 11 These isles were \nsaid to be ruled by nine fairy sisters, the leader of whom was Morgan. \n\nArthur\'s legends generally suggest no human king, but a Brythonic \ngod, whom Johnson called a Celtic Zeus. 12 He may have been \nincarnate in one or several warrior kings for brief periods, but his basic \nstory was mythic rather than historical. \n\n1.

In Persia he \nbecame known as Ahriman, the dark earth god, opponent or \nsubterranean alter ego of the solar deity Ormazd (Ahura Mazda). In \nCeltic Ireland he was Eremon, one of the sacred kings who married \nthe Earth (Tara). \n\nThough there was nothing "pure" about either the name or the \nfar-flung mixture of tribes it was supposed to describe, the term \n"pure Aryan" was revived in Nazi Germany to support a mythological \nconcept of Teutonic stock, the so-called Master Race. Non-Aryans \nwere all the "inferior" strains: Semites, Negroes, gypsies, Slavs, and \nLatinate or "swarthy" people whose blood was said to be polluting \nthe Nordic superiority of their betters. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 33. \n\n\n\nAsceticism \n\nThe religion of self-denial, such as practiced by early Christian \neremites, characterized by self-inflicted pain, hunger, and other auster- \nities, and renunciation of sensual pleasures. \n\nPerhaps the earliest sectaries to regard asceticism as the key \nto heaven were Jain Buddhists (see Jains), whose theology influenced \nPersian patriarchs, who in turn influenced Jewish eremites like the \nEssenes. Jain Buddhist monks had already penetrated the courts of \nSyria, Egypt, Macedonia, and Epirus by the 4th century B.C., and \nwere glorified in legend for the alleged magic powers they developed \nthrough prodigies of self-denial. 1 \n\nOriginally, men\'s ascetic practices seem to have evolved from a \nnotion that extreme forms of self-denial would bring them the \nmagical female capacity to give birth. Oriental myths said the first \n\n\n\n62 \n\n\n\ncreator-gods acquired the ability to produce living things by "practic- \ning fierce asceticism for ten thousand years." 2 \n\nThough men never achieved the ability to give birth, they claimed \nother miraculous powers developed by asceticism. Perfected eremites \nwere said to fly, to walk on water, to understand all languages, to turn \nbase metals into gold, to heal lameness and blindness, and other \nmiracles that became the common property of all scriptures including \nthe Christian ones. 5 \n\nJain Buddhists looked upon women as hopelessly inferior in the \npursuit of asceticism. Their handbook said no woman could achieve \nNirvana, because "in the womb, between the breasts, in their navel and \nloins, a subtle emanation of life is continually taking place. How then \ncan they be fit for self-control? A woman may be pure in faith and even \noccupied with a study of the sutras or the practice of a terrific \nasceticism; in her case there will be no falling away of karmic matter." 4 \n\nSome of the ascetics openly despised sexuality and motherhood. \nThe Mahabharata anticipated St. Augustine\'s remarks about the \nnastiness of birth: "-Man emerges mixed with excrement and water, \nfouled with the impurities of woman. A wise man will avoid the \ncontaminating society of women as he would the touch of bodies \ninfested with vermin." 5 Some advertised their renunciation of sex by \ncastrating themselves or affixing large metal rings in the flesh of the \npenis. 6 \n\nEssenic Judaism and early Christianity were offshoots of the Jain \ntradition, urging abandonment of the family and of all secular \nconcerns. 7 Like the art of the Jains, Christian art in the early medieval \nperiod showed stiff, crude, doll-like figures, apparently bodiless under \ntheir wooden draperies, even hands and faces badly drawn. Not even \nartists were permitted to study the human form. 8 To look at some- \nthing attractive especially if it was made of flesh was highly suspect \nbecause the observer might enjoy the act of looking. According to St. \nJerome, a Christian must consider poisonous every act or experience \nhaving the smallest hint of sensual pleasure. 9 \n\nPain, however, was permitted and encouraged throughout the \nChristian era. St. Catherine of Siena was highly praised for whipping \nherself three times a day, once for her own sins, once for the sins of the \nliving, and once for the sins of the dead. St. Simeon Stylites was \nglorified for remaining motionless on top of his pillar, like Buddhist \nstanding-yogis, until his living flesh rotted. 10 \n\nFathers of the church constantly urged asceticism upon the faith- \nful. Gregory of Nyssa touted it in terms of both wetness and dryness: \n"As the tympanum, from which all moisture has been removed so that it \nis exceedingly dry, gives out a loud noise, so also is virginity, which \nreceives no life-giving moisture, illustrious and renowned." " Again he \nsaid: "We often see water, contained in a pipe, bursting upward \nthrough this constraining force, which will not let it leak, and this in \nspite of its natural gravitation; in the same way the mind of man, \n\n\n\nAsceticism \n\n\n\nMahabharata \n\nIndian epic poem, \nconsisting of \nhistorical and legendary \nmaterial gathered \nbetween the 4th and \n10th centuries a.d., \nincluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n\n\nAsceticism enclosed in the compact channel of an habitual continence, and not \n\nhaving any side issues, will be raised by virtue of its natural powers of \n^ B| ^ B ^^^^ B i^^ motion to an exalted love." n \n\nMoral tales told by the Christian fathers concentrated on renuncia- \ntion of sexual love, and acceptance of painful martyrdom. The tale of \nSts. Cyprian and Justina is typical. Cyprian, a pagan sorcerer, fell in love \nwith the Christian maiden Justina and cast a love spell on her. \nThough sworn to virginity like all good Christian maidens, Justina was \ntortured by desire. Nevertheless she conquered her desire and proved \nher piety with such prodigies of asceticism that she impressed even \nCyprian: she fasted almost to death, she slept naked on the stony \nground, she mutilated herself to spoil her beauty. 13 Cyprian was so \nintrigued by all this he turned Christian too, and was martyred along \nwith his incorrigible virgin. 14 \n\nHuman love was anathema to the early Christians who insisted \nthat families must be abandoned. Sexual impulses were perverted \ninto unnatural obsessions. 15 The fall of Rome was not entirely unrelated \nto Christians\' abhorrence of the basic social unit of the state: the \ninterlocked loyalties and dependencies of the family. Jesus himself \nundermined the family in his teaching: "If any man come to me, and \nhate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and breth- \nren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple" \n(Luke 14:26). Becker says Christianity stood for "renunciation of this \nworld and the satisfactions of this life, which is why the pagans thought \nChristianity was crazy. It was a sort of anti-heroism by an animal who \ndenied life in order to deny evil." 16 \n\nPrinciples of asceticism so embedded themselves in Christian \nsociety that nearly every kind of sensual pleasure came to be regarded \nas wicked only because it was pleasant. The delights of sacramental \ndancing were forbidden. A story from Ramersdorf in the Rhine- \nland tells of a Christian missionary priest who found youths and maidens \ndancing together on the Sabbath. He called God\'s curse on them, \nwhich forced them to go on dancing day and night until they lost their \nminds. 17 Some European peasants still abstain from sexual inter- \ncourse during the sowing season, in the church-fostered belief that \nsexual activity might call down a curse on the crop. 18 \n\nIn the 18th century, theologians were still preaching the wicked- \nness of even the most subtle feelings of pleasure. Beaumont \ncounseled women especially to attribute any enjoyable bodily sensation \nto the devil\'s influence: "If ye perceive a sudden sweet taste in your \nmouths or feel any warmth in your breasts, like fire, or any form of \npleasure in any part of your body, or ... if ye become aware by \noccasion of pleasure or satisfaction derived from such perception, that \nyour hearts are drawn away from the contemplation of Jesus Christ \nand from spiritual exercises . . . then this sensation is very much to be \nsuspected of coming from the Enemy; and therefore were it ever so \nwonderful and striking, still renounce it." 19 Yet the obsessive contem- \n\n\n\n64 \n\n\n\nplation of pain, starting with Jesus\'s pain on the cross, was always to Asceticism \n\nbe encouraged. \n\nThe most significant difference between Christianity and its pagan ^^^^^^^^^_ \nforerunners was this reversal of the pleasure-pain continuum. Earlier \nsocieties regarded sensual pleasure as a touch of divinity, and "bliss" \nsexual or otherwise as a foretaste of heaven. Woman was a carrier \nof the divine spark because of her capacity to give and receive physical \npleasure. The Christian theory turned this opinion completely \naround. Fathers of the church taught that the human race must die out \nthrough universal celibacy, before Jesus could return and establish his \nheaven on earth. Reasoning that man fell from grace through woman, \nman could return to grace only by renouncing woman. 20 Therefore, \nmedieval churchmen came to identify sexuality with the worst of \nheresies and sins, especially since St. Augustine had labeled it the \npipeline of original sin. Even Protestant theologians adopted this view. \nCalvin said that, because of its origin in sexuality and in a woman\'s \nbody, every child was "defiled and polluted" in God\'s sight even before \nit saw the light of the day; a newborn infant is a "seed-bed of sin and \ntherefore cannot but be odious and abominable to God." Martin Luther \nmarried an ex-nun, but still didn\'t think much of sex. He said, "Had \nGod consulted me in the matter, I would have advised him to continue \nthe generation of the species by fashioning them out of clay." 21 \n\nThis note of arrogance, even hubris, in the idea of man issuing \ninstructions to God, was always a hidden component of asceticism, \ndespite its outward show of extreme or unnatural humility. "Nothing is \nprouder than the humility of the ascetic of other-worldly spirit that \nproclaims itself superior to the whole natural world, or than the \nmysticism that renounces the self only to commune with God \nhimself." 22 Here lies the real reason for men\'s secret delight in ascetic \nprinciples and practices. It must be remembered that the original \npurpose of such self-denial was to become identified with a god and to \nacquire God\'s sacred powers for one\'s self. \n\nBecoming a god meant acquiring the ability to perform miracles, as \nmany Christian ascetics were supposed to have done. By definition, \nmiracles flouted the laws of nature. Thus the ascetic became deliberate- \nly un-natural, confusing the denial of his own instinctual desires with \ndenial of Mother Nature\'s observed habits. Ascetic ideals therefore \nplaced body and spirit in conflict with each other. "Asceticism is the \nethical code which arises inevitably from a dualistic opposition between \nthe spiritual and the natural. These are represented as absolutely irre- \nconcilable and mutually antagonistic; if a man is to escape the natural he \nmust renounce the rights of his physical nature in the interests of his \nspiritual." 25 The psychic problem of such dualistic opinion is still much \nin evidence. \n\n1.

Angus, 219. \n\n\n\nAsherah \n\nSemitic name of the Great Goddess, possibly from Old Iranian asha, \n"Universal Law," a law of the matriarch, like Roman ius naturale. 1 \nAsherah was "in wisdom the Mistress of the Gods." 2 Sumerians \ncalled her Ashnan, "strength of all things," and "a kindly and bountiful \nmaiden." 3 Her sacred city Mar-ash appears in the Bible as Mareshah \n(Joshua 15:44). \n\nThe Old Testament "Asherah" is translated "grove," without any \nexplanation that the sacred grove represented the Goddess\'s genital \ncenter, birthplace of all things. In the matriarchal period, Hebrews \nworshipped the Goddess in groves (1 Kings 14:23), later cut down by \npatriarchal reformers who burned the bones of Asherah\'s priests on their \nown altars (2 Chronicles 24:4-5). \n\nThe Goddess\'s grove-yoni was Athra qaddisa, "the holy place" \n(literally, "divine harlot"). Sometimes she was called simply "Holi- \nness," a word later applied to Yahweh. Canaanites called her Qaniyatu \nelima, She Who Gives Birth to the Gods, or Rabbatu athiratu \nyammi, Lady Who Traverses the Sea (i.e., the Moon). 4 Rabbatu was an \nearly female form of rabbi. Athirat, Athra, Aethra, Athyr, and Egypt\'s \nHathor were all variations of the same name for the Goddess. 5 In Egypt \nshe was also a Law-giving Mother, Ashesh, an archaic form of Isis; \nthe name meant both "pouring out" and "supporting," the functions of \nher breasts. Her yonic shrine in Thebes was Asher, Ashrel, or Ashrelt. \nSome called her "Great Lady of Ashert, the lady of heaven, the queen \nof the gods." 6 \n\nFor a while, Asherah accepted the Semitic god El as her consort. \nShe was the Heavenly Cow, he the Bull. 7 After their sacred marriage, \nshe bore the Heavenly Twins, Shaher and Shalem, the stars of morning \nand evening (see Lucifer). The marriage rite seems to have involved \nthe cooking of a kid in its mother\'s milk, a procedure later forbidden by \nJewish priests (Exodus 23:19). 8 \n\n1. Larousse, 312; Bachofen, 192. 2.

Ashes were called the seed of \nthe fire god Agni, with power to absolve all sins. Even if a man does \n"a thousand things that one ought not to do, by bathing in ashes he will \ncause all of that to be burnt to ashes as fire burns a forest with its ener- \ngy." Another source said ashes stood for the purifying blood of Shiva, in \n\n\n\n66 \n\n\n\nwhich one could bathe away sins, as Christians bathed in the blood of \nthe Lamb. 1 \n\nAt Rome\'s New Year Feast of Atonement in March, people wore \nsackcloth and bathed in ashes to atone for their sins. 2 Then as now, \nNew Year\'s Eve was a carnival of eating, drinking, and sinning, on the \ntheory that all sins would be wiped out the following day. As the \ndying god of March, Mars took his worshippers\' sins with him into \ndeath. Therefore the carnival fell on dies martis, the Day of Mars. In \nEnglish this was Tuesday, because Mars was identified with the Saxon \ngod Tiw. In French the carnival day was Mardi Gras, "Fat Tues- \nday," the day of merrymaking before Ash Wednesday. \n\nA Catholic directory of 1 5 1 1 ordered priests to say to the congre- \ngation on Ash Wednesday, "Remember, man, you are ashes and to \nashes will return." Fuller\'s Church History said the purpose of Ash \nWednesday was to remind every man that he is "but ashes and earth, \nand thereto shall return." 5 These maxims oddly contradicted the \nchurch\'s official doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh. Their purpose \nwas to justify with* some Christian gloss the ancient notion that \nredemption might be brought about by contact with ashes. \n\n1. O\'Flaherty, 148-49, 174. 2. Encyc.

Tobit\'s Asmodeus was really "the god \nAsmo," or Aeshma, a Persian deity associated with Ahriman. Zoroastri- \nan priests may have brought about his original diabolization because \nof an archaic connection with the Goddess Ma. 1 \n\n1 . Larousse, 3 1 8. \n\n\n\nBook of Tobit One \n\nof the Apocrypha, once \naccepted as part of \nthe Judeo-Christian \ncanon of sacred \nscriptures but later elim- \ninated from the \nofficial canon. \n\n\n\nAss \n\nThe ass-god Pales had an extensive cult throughout the ancient \nworld. Palestine, Philistia, and the Palatine Hill in Rome were named \nfor Pales, who was both male and female. 1 \n\nThe Old Norse word Ass meant both "Asian" and "deity," \npossibly indicating that the divine ass originated in Asia. 2 The pre- \nVedic sacred king Ravana sported ten crowned human heads \nsurmounted by one ass head, symbolizing the spirit of the ass god \nincarnate in ten kings. 3 The long ears of the ass seem to have had the \nsame significance of virility in ancient India as the horns of the sacred \nbull or stag. 4 \n\nTacitus said the Jews worshipped the ass because wild asses were \nresponsible for their survival in the desert. 5 According to Genesis 36:24, \n\n\n\nCornelius Tacitus \n\nRoman historian \nand rhetorician, ca. \n56-120 a.d. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n\n\nAss \n\n\n\nPyramid Texts Col- \nlections of prayers, \nhymns, and magic \nspells inscribed on the \ninner walls of the \npyramids at Saqqarah \n(Sakkara), dating \nfrom the 5 th through \n7th dynasties. \n\n\n\nit was the tribal matriarch Anah, or Hannah, who first found asses in the \nwilderness. Balaam\'s oracular she-ass may have been a manifestation of \nthe spirit of Anah, as Balaam himself was another name for Baal. \nSamson slew the Philistines with an ass\'s jawbone, the same bone still \nregarded as a seat of the soul by some African tribes. 6 Jesus entered \nJerusalem on an ass\'s colt, symbol of the New Year. The lilim or \nChildren of Lilith were ass-haunched, for they were spirits left over \nfrom the real source of the Jewish ass-cult: Egypt, home of the ass- \nheaded god Set, or Seth. \n\nSet once ruled the dynastic gods, and in token of his sovereignty \ndisplayed a pair of ass\'s ears at the tip of a reed scepter. The Hyksos \nkings of Egypt revived Set\'s cult in the 2nd millenium B.C., perhaps \nbecause their own ass-eared Midas was a similar god-king. The annual \nalternation of Set and his brother Osiris (or Horus), who murdered each \nother in perpetual rivalry for the favors of Isis, reflected constant \nreplacement of sacred kings in pre-dynastic times. 7 \n\nAss-eared king Midas, a son of Cybele, died of drinking bull\'s \nblood. In other words, he was connected with the Taurobolium or bull- \nsacrifice made in honor of both Cybele and Isis. Midas has been \nidentified with Mita ("Seed"), a king of the Moschians or "calf-men," \nwho invaded the country of the Hittites from Thrace during the second \nmillenium B.C. Midas\'s Golden Touch and ass\'s ears link him with the \ncult of Set and the Golden Calf (Horus), whose image was worshipped \nby the Israelites (Exodus 32:2-4). \n\nUnder Egypt\'s Hyksos kings, Set was a god of the hot desert wind, \nknown as the Breath of the Ass. He was "Lord of the Chambers of the \nSouth," whence storm winds came. 8 His wind from the desert was \nsupposed to bring pestilence, i.e., typhus, derived from Set\'s Greek \nname, Typhon. This name was interlingual and world-wide. It meant \nboth the ass god and the wind called tufan in Arabic and Hindustani; t\'ai \nfung in Chinese; and tuffbon or Typhoon in the South Pacific. 9 \n\nAss-headed Set was a sacrificial deity in the cult of Horus and \nOsiris. He was crucified on a furka and wounded in the side. 10 He and \nHorus were represented as alternating year-gods who fought and \ncastrated one another, each being baptized in the blood of the other\'s \n"phallic eye," as the Pyramid Text said: "Horus is purified with the \nEye of his brother Set; Set is purified with the Eye of his brother \nHorus." n The Eye or phallus passed from one to the other. A statue \nof Horus at Coptos carried Set\'s severed phallus in his hand. 12 After \ncastrating Set, Horus spread his blood on the fields to render them \nfertile the usual fructification-by-male-blood found in the oldest sacri- \nficial Mysteries. 13 \n\nThus, Set and Horus were remnants of a primitive sacred-king \ncult, which the Jews adopted. The story of the rival gods appeared in \nthe Bible as Seth\'s supplanting of the sacrificed shepherd Abel, evidently \n\n\n\n68 \n\n\n\nthe same "Good Shepherd" as Osiris-Horus (Genesis 4:25). Their \nrivalry was resolved in Egypt by having the pharaoh unite both gods in \nhimself. Tomb paintings of Rameses IV showed him as both Set and \nHorus, two heads set upon one neck. 14 \n\nSimilarly, the Jewish God uniting both Father and Son was \nsometimes an ass-headed man crucified on a tree. This was one of the \nearliest representations of the Messiah\'s crucifixion. Some said Christ \nwas the same as the Jewish ass-god Iao, identified with Set. 15 Jews in \nRome were said to worship an ass\'s head as their deity. 16 \n\nThe Roman cult of the ass apparently originated in Libya, home of \nthe bisexual Pales, whose temple stood on the Palatine Hill and gave \nrise to the word "palace." 17 Servius said Pales was a Goddess, the Diva \nPalatua, a disguise of Vesta. Others said Pales was either a female \nprotectress of herd animals, or Vesta\'s male consort. In the first two \ncenturies a.d., Pales was worshipped as a priapic god at the festival of \nthe Palilia, traditional date of the founding of Rome, when the Palladi- \num was brought to Vesta\'s temple. 18 Priests of Pales wore ass-head \nmasks as they danced in honor of the long-eared deity. The Palilia was \ntaken into the Christian calendar as the Feast of St. George. One of \nits old customs may have given rise to the Halloween game of "Pin the \nTail on the Donkey," which recalls Rome\'s sacrifices of equine tails \ntriumphantly carried to the temple of Vesta. 19 \n\nI.

See Aladdin. \n\n\n\nAstarte \n\nLady of Byblos, one of the oldest forms of the Great Goddess in the \nMiddle East, identified with Egypt\'s Hathor, Mycenae\'s Demeter, \nCyprus\'s Aphrodite. \n\nHer shrine at Byblos dated back to the Neolithic and flourished \nthroughout the Bronze Age. 1 She was the same creating-preserving- \nand-destroying Goddess worshipped by all Indo-European cultures, and \nstill typified by Kali as the symbol of Nature. Astarte was the "true \nsovereign of the world," tirelessly creating and destroying, eliminating \n\n\n\nThe Bible calls her \nAsherah or Ashtoreth, \nthe Goddess wor- \nshipped by Solomon \n(1 Kings 11:5). \n\n\n\n69 \n\n\n\nAster \nAstraea \n\n\n\nTo the Arabs the \nGoddess was Athtar, \n"Venus in the \nMorning." In Aramaic \nshe was Attar-Sa- \nmayin, "Morning Star \nof Heaven," uniting \ntwo sexes in herself, like \nLucifer the Morning \nStar and Diana Luci- \nfera. Her Hurrian \nname was Attart, or \nsometimes Ishara, \nanother form of Ishtar, \n"the Star." 4 To Ca- \nnaanites, she was \nCelestial Ruler, Mis- \ntress of Kingship, \nmother of all baaJim \n(gods). 5 \n\n\n\nthe old and generating the new. 2 Sidonian kings could not rule \nwithout her permission. Each king styled himself first and foremost \n"Priest of Astarte." \n\nSumerian cylinder seals from Lagash, ca. 2300 B.C., showed the \nGoddess in a pose identical with Kali\'s love-and-death sacramental \nposture, squatting on top of her consort\'s body. 5 \n\nAstarte ruled all the spirits of the dead who lived in heaven wearing \nbodies of light, visible from earth as stars. Hence, she was known as \nAstroarche, "Queen of the Stars." 6 She was the mother of all souls in \nheaven, the Moon surrounded by her star-children, to whom she \ngave their "astral" (starry) bodies. Occultists still speak of the astral body \nas an invisible double, having forgotten the word\'s original connota- \ntion of starlight. 7 \n\nAstarte-Ashtoreth was transformed into a devil by Christian writ- \ners, who automatically assumed that any deity mentioned in the Bible \nother than Yahweh was one of the denizens of hell. She was also \nmasculinized. One finds in books of the 1 5th and 16th centuries a \ndemon Ashtoreth or Astaroth, a "duke" or "prince" of hell. 8 Milton \nknew better; he spoke of "Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent \nhorns." 9 \n\nScholars who really understood the mystery of Astarte recognized \nin her one of the ancient prototypes of the virgin Mary. In Syria and \nEgypt her sacred dramas celebrated the rebirth of the solar god from the \ncelestial Virgin each 25th of December. A newborn child was \nexhibited, while the cry went up that the Virgin had brought forth. \nFrazer says, "No doubt the Virgin who thus conceived and bore a \nson on the twenty-fifth of December was the great Oriental goddess \nwhom the Semites called the Heavenly Virgin or simply the Heavenly \nGoddess; in Semitic lands she was a form of Astarte." 10 \n\n1.

Like Minerva, Athene, Maat, and other \nmanifestations of the same Goddess, she was characterized as a celestial \nVirgin dispensing the fates of men. See Virgo. \n\n\n\nAstrology \n\n\n\nAstrology \n\nStudy of the stars has been called "the basis of all intellectual \nculture." \' It was highly refined by the Chaldeans, who were simulta- \nneously astronomers and astrologers. Unlike modern "Chaldeans," \nthey were moon worshippers, basing their system almost entirely on the \nmovements of the Moon-goddess. Their zodiac was known as \nHouses of the Moon. 2 \n\nApparently a majority of moon-watchers were women, the pries- \ntesses charged with determining correct seasons for planting and \nharvest, drawing up calendars, etc. Pliny said the study of the heavens, \nto foretell events such as eclipses, was traditionally the business of \nwomen. He suspected the priestesses\' magic didn\'t cause eclipses, but \nrather foresaw them by scientific measurements; yet "the most part \nof the common people have been and are of this opinion . . . that all the \nsame is done by enchantments, and that by the means of some \nsorceries and herbs together, both sun and moon may be charmed, and \nenforced both to loose and recover their light: to do which feat, \nwomen are thought to be more skilful and meet than men." He credited \nthe Goddesses Medea and Circe with special powers over the lights \nof heaven. 3 \n\nDivination by the lights of heaven was another particular province \nof the Moon-goddess and her sybils, the word cognate with the \nGoddess Cybele and possibly derived from Chaldean subultu, the \nCelestial Virgin (the constellation of Virgo). 4 An archaic term for \nastrological divination was mathesis, "the Learning," literally Mother- \nwisdom. Chaldean astrologers were Mathematici, "learned \nmothers." 5 \n\nAs a result of its ancient feminine associations, astrology was \nviewed as a devilish art by many fathers of the Christian church. \nSome thought it indistinguishable from witchcraft. Others respected it. \nOrigen said the stars are intelligent spirits, able to foresee the future \nand communicate their knowledge by their observed motions. St. \nThomas Aquinas agreed with this. He said man\'s fate is the power \nexerted by the stars in their movements. 6 \n\nSavonarola thought it a disgrace, however, that in his day the \nchurch was "wholly governed by astrology," as he said. Every \nimportant prelate had his "Chaldean" at his side, determining every \nmove by the stars. 7 St. Jerome said astrology was idolatry. Sts. Gregory, \nAmbrose, Chrysostom, Eusebius, and Lactantius all condemned it. \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, ex- \nerting a powerful \ninfluence on the early \nGreek church. At \nfirst he was accounted a \nsaint, but three cen- \nturies after his death he \nwas declared a here- \ntic because of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n\n\nAtalanta \n\n\n\nCouncil of Toledo \n\nThe greatest theological \nsignificance was at- \ntributed to the church \ncouncil held in Tole- \ndo in 675 a.d., though \nthere were seventeen \nother church councils in \nthe same city be- \ntween the 5 th and 8th \ncenturies. \n\nZodiacus Christianas \nA curious astrological \nwork claiming Jesuit \norigin. Full title: \nZodiacus Christianus \nlocupletatus seu \nSigna XII Divinae \nPraedestinationis. \nTotidem Symbolis ex- \nplicata ab Hierem \nDrexilio e Societatis \nJesu. \n\nPeter of Abano \n\n(1250-1318) Renais- \nsance scholar, \nphysician, geomancer, \nastrologer, and here- \ntic; an acquaintance of \nMarco Polo. \n\n\n\nSt. Augustine said astrology must be expelled from all Christian nations. \nIt was prohibited by the Council of Toledo. 8 \n\nDespite all this, the church took astrology to its bosom in the 12th \nand 1 3th centuries. Pope Julius II settled the date of his coronation on \nthe advice of astrologers. Pope Paul III planned the consistory by \nhoroscopes. Pope Leo X founded a chair of astrology in a major \nuniversity. 9 Signs of the zodiac were associated with the apostles. \nCathedrals were decorated with astrological symbols. The Zodiacus \nChristianus compared the zodiac to the stages of Christian life and the \ntwelve virtues. 10 \n\nPeter of Abano was one of the few unbelievers. He openly scoffed \nat God, and managed to avoid the Inquisition only by dying at an \nopportune moment. Toward the end, he remarked that he had devoted \nhis life to three noble arts: philosophy, which made him subtle; \nmedicine, which made him rich; and astrology, which made him a liar. 11 \n\nProtestants were not as enthusiastic about astrology as Catholics. \nQueen Elizabeth I of England disapproved of the Chaldean art, fearing \nimplications of treason against the royal person in prognosticating the \nlength of her life. Toward the latter part of her reign, she imposed \nsevere legal penalties for casting royal horoscopes. 12 Protestant leaflets \nlisted among the "sins of the papists" such as "Observation and choice \nof days, of planetary hours, of motions and courses of stars \n. . . horoscoping, or marking the hours of nativities, witchcrafts, en- \nchantments, and all such superstitious trumpery." 13 \n\nYet the common people retained many superstitious beliefs based \non astrology. The idea that the stars are souls in heaven never really \ndied out. English peasants were sure that a falling star denoted either a \nconception or a birth some said one, some said the other, for none \nwere clear about which moment the soul descended from heaven to \noccupy its new body. 14 Because it represented an essence of new life, \nthe falling star was and still is "wished on," like any spirit thought to be \npassing from one world to another. \n\n1.

Christian \ntheologians tended to regard atheism as devilish, though atheism im- \nplied disbelief in devils as well as all other supernatural entities. \n\nOriental thinkers were less simplistic about atheism. The more \nadvanced sages taught that non-belief can be more "religious" than \nbelief indeed, atheism may make better human beings than faith can \nmake. In the east "it is not thought impossible that atheism may be as \nprofoundly religious as theism, nor is atheism regarded by religious men \nas in itself unspiritual. This is extremely hard for a westerner to \nunderstand he does not see that the essence of religion lies in the \nreligious experience, and not in any belief at all, and that all so-called \nreligious beliefs or doctrines are merely theories about the religious \nexperience." \' \n\nEvans- Wentz called attention to the same Oriental thought: \n" The Fatherhood of God\' as a personal and anthropomorphic deity is \nthe cornerstone of Christian theology, but in Buddhism although \nthe Buddha neither denied nor affirmed the existence of a Supreme \nDeity it has no place, because, as the Buddha maintained, neither \nbelieving nor not believing in a Supreme God, but self-exertion in right- \ndoing, is essential to comprehending the true nature of life." 2 \n\nBy these standards, no criminal could be considered religious, no \nmatter how much faith he professed.

Oriental sages viewed theological \n\nmmmm ^ m j, mam ^^ reasoning with a certain contempt, as irrelevant to the behavior that \nconstitutes true religion: "Mere talk about religion is only an intellec- \ntual exercise. . . .

Though classic \nwriters insisted on her chastity, older traditions gave her several \nconsorts, such as Hephaestus and Pan. 1 She was united with the phallic \nPallas, whose "Palladium" was a lingam, later Rome\'s greatest fetish. 2 \n\nAthene came from North Africa. She was the Libyan Triple \nGoddess Neith, Metis, Medusa, Anath, or Ath-enna. An inscription \nat Larnax-Lapithou named her Athene in Greek, Anat in Phoenician. 3 \nPre-Hellenic myths said she came from the uterus of Lake Tritonis \n(Three Queens) in Libya. 4 Egyptians sometimes called Isis Athene, \nwhich meant "I have come from myself." 5 \n\nGreeks claimed Athene was born from Zeus\'s head, after he \nSign of Athene swallowed her mother Metis i.e., Medusa, "Female Wisdom," \n\nformerly symbolized by the Gorgoneum, Athene\'s snake-haired mask, \ninvested with power to turn men to stone. 6 Gorgo, or Gorgon, was \nAthene\'s Destroyer aspect. 7 Funerary statues or phallic pillars were her \n"men turned to stone," perhaps even identified with the pillars of the \nParthenon which was seized by Christians at an unknown date in \nthe 5th or 6th century a.d. and rededicated as a temple of the virgin \nMary. 8 \n\n1.

This was a re-interpreta- \ntion of his primary earth-supporting function. As Prometheus was \nassociated with the Caucasus and Heracles with the "Pillars of \nHeracles" in the west, so Atlas was associated with the Atlas Mountains \nof Africa indicating that the Titans were originally divine pillars of \nthe heavens, upholding the world. Atlas might be compared to the \n\n\n\n74 \n\n\n\nVedic god Vishnu who took the form of a tortoise (Greek Tartarus) Atonement \n\nand supported the world on his back. \n\n\n\nAtonement \n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia the Day of Atonement corresponded to the \nbeginning of the New Year, when all sins were collectively purged for a \nnew time-cycle. The Jews\' Yom Kippur, Day of Atonement, was \nbased on the Sumero-Babylonian kupparu, an atonement ceremony in \nwhich a sheep was ceremonially loaded with all the community\'s sins, \nand killed. The sheep was an animal substitute for the man who in \nearlier times died as Sin Bearer, Savior, or Good Shepherd that is, \nDumuzi or Tammuz. \n\nA ram played the part of Sin Bearer at atonement festivals of \nEgypt, which is why Aries the Ram is still the zodiacal sign of the \nNew Year that began in March, by ancient reckoning. Egyptians called \nhim Amon the ram god; the Jews assimilated him to the paschal lamb \nand sacrificed him at Passover. \n\nAll over the world, the sheep stood for the shepherd as an \natonement-victim. In China the name Ch\'iang, "Shepherd," was \ngiven to war prisoners who provided sacrificial victims. The pictograph \nfor "shepherd" was a man with a knife severing his neck. 1 The dead \nshepherd was also called the Son of God. In Samarkand during the 2nd \ncentury B.C., "the Son of God died with the seventh moon ... all the \ninhabitants, without distinction, appear dressed in robes of black wool. \nThey go barefooted, striking their breasts, uttering loud wails and \nweeping copious tears. Three hundred persons, both men and women, \ngo about the fields scattering grass, and looking for the remains of the \nSon of God." 2 Such was a Chinese traveler\'s impression of the rite \nknown in Greece as the anagnorisis, search and discovery (see \nDrama). \n\nIsrael\'s law called for a goat to bear away the sins of the community \nto the god Azazel, whom the Syrians called Aziz, "the Lord\'s \nMessenger." 3 Having selected the scape-goat, the priest would "confess \nover him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their \ntransgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat" \n(Leviticus 16:21). A first goat was driven away, a second one was \nkilled, for no god would absolve sins without an offering of blood: \n"Almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without \nshedding of blood there is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22). \n\nAs development of the wool industry made it more profitable \nto keep sheep alive for their fleeces than to kill them for their meat, the \ngoat became a more popular sacrificial victim. The animals were \nsometimes skinned to produce copious shedding of blood for remission \n\n\n\n75 \n\n\n\nAtonement of sins. An incantation from the Shurpu series gives a magic rationale \n\nfor flaying a scape-goat: \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ m As this goat skin is pulled off and thrown into the fire, and the burning \n\nFlame consumes it, and it does not return to its goat, and it is no longer \ndyed (with blood), so the oath, the ban, the pain, the misery, the disease, \nthe sickness, the trespass, the misdeed, the crime, the sin, the disease \nwhich dwells in my body, my flesh, and my joints, may they be pulled off \nlike this goat skin, and may the ban depart and may I see the light. 4 \n\nEarly Greek myths evoke primitive totemism with goat gods \nflayed in atonement for the sins of others. Athene flayed the goat god \nPallas, or Pan, and made her aegis from his skin. 5 Phrygians called \nthe same god the satyr Marsyas, nailed to a pine tree and flayed in \natonement for a crime against Apollo. In Rome, goats were flayed at \nthe purification festival of the Lupercalia, where the dying satyr-god \nFaunus was offered to the Sabine mother-goddess Ops. 6 \n\nThe old Roman New Year was celebrated at the Ides of March \nand called the Mamuralia, carrying another trace of scapegoat- \nsacrifice. A man dressed in goatskins was led through the city in \nprocession, beaten with rods, and driven away into exile with the \nformula, "Out with hunger, in with health and wealth." 7 Ovid said the \nMarch scapegoat was a legendary smith named Mamurius, who \nforged coins representing each month of the year zodiacal sun- \nsymbols. \n\nSuch practices make it clear that scapegoat-sacrifices were formerly \nhuman, and the animals replaced human victims. Liturgical formulae \nnearly always sent human sins into oblivion along with the sacrificed \nanimal. Egyptians, killing the bull that represented Osiris, said the \nwhole nation\'s sins were placed on his head. 8 Animal sacrifice took a \nmore humane form in Tibet: at the New Year ceremony, three \nhorses and three dogs were smeared with red paint instead of flayed, \nthen dedicated to the temple. 9 \n\nChristian symbolism made Jesus the sacrificial Lamb of God slain \n\nto atone for sin like the paschal lamb. Some early Christian writers \n\ninsisted that animal sacrifice came first, and human sacrifice was a later, \n\n"higher" development: "God is a man-eater. For this reason men are \n\nsacrificed to him." 10 Among medieval theologians there was a general \n\nopinion that Jesus\'s sacrifice was not really effective; only "a few" \n\nwere saved by the Savior\'s death. St. Thomas Aquinas and others \n\nclaimed the vast majority of people were still doomed to eternal \n\nsuffering in hell. 11 Thus the theory of atonement for all time or for all \n\nhumanity was actually denied by the same church that propounded \n\nit as a basis for worldly power. \n\n1.

She was \nthe Destroyer whose function was to cut the thread of life that the first \nsister spun, and the second one wove. She was usually depicted as an \nold woman carrying a pair of shears. Like Kali the Destroyer, she was \nalso worshipped as a Goddess in her own right. In Parthia, the \n"Virgin-Land," she had her own holy city, Atropatene. Its modern \nname is Azerbaijan. 1 \n\n\n\nl.Thc \n\n\n\n173. \n\n\n\nAtropos \nAttis \n\n\n\nAttis \n\nThe cult of Attis strongly influenced early Christianity. \n\nAttis accompanied Cybele, the Great Mother of the Gods, \nbrought to Rome from Phrygia in 204 B.C. They were established in a \ntemple on the Vatican hill, where they remained for six centuries. 1 At \nfirst Attis was separated from, and subordinated to, the Goddess, \nwhom the emperor Augustus regarded as the Supreme Mother of \nRome. "The Romans tolerated Attis because, maintaining the tradi- \ntion of earlier days, they continued to regard Cybele as a national \nGoddess." 2 \n\nAttis was a son of the Goddess\'s earthly incarnation, the virgin \nNana, who miraculously conceived him by eating an almond or a \npomegranate, yonic symbols both. Thus he was a typical "god without a \nfather," the Virgin\'s son. He grew up to become a sacrificial victim \nand Savior, slain to bring salvation to mankind. His body was eaten by \nhis worshippers in the form of bread. 3 He was resurrected as "The \nMost High God, who holds the universe together." 4 His epiphany was \nannounced with the words, "Hail, Bridegroom, Hail, new Light." 5 \nLike his priests he was castrated, then crucified on a pine tree, whence \nhis holy blood poured down to redeem the earth. \n\nAttis\'s passion was celebrated on the 25th of March, exactly nine \nmonths before the solstitial festival of his birth, the 25th of Decem- \nber. The time of his death was also the time of his conception, or \nre-conception. To mark the event when Attis entered his mother to \nbeget his reincarnation, his tree-phallus was carried into her sacred \ncavern. Thus the virgin mother Nana was actually the Goddess \nherself: she who was called Inanna by the Sumerians, Mari-Anna by the \nCanaanites, Anna Perenna by the Sabines, and Nanna, mother of the \ndying god Balder, in northern Europe. 6 \n\nChristians claimed the same dates for the conception and birth of \ntheir savior. The usual quarrels ensued. The Christians resorted to \ntheir favorite argument, that the devil had established pagan Mysteries \nin imitation of Christianity before there was a Christianity. Tertullian \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens Ter- \ntullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Car- \nthage of pagan parents. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n\n\nAttis said, "The devil by the mysteries of his idols, imitates even the main \n\nparts of the divine mysteries." 7 \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Followers of Attis eventually lost their sacrificial day to the Chris- \n\ntians. Justinian ruled that March 25 would be known as the day of \nthe Annunciation, or Lady Day. Naturally, the day of the Annunciation \nwas the day of Jesus\'s conception, so that he, like Attis, could be born \nnine months later at the winter solstice, as were all gods assimilated \nto the sun and called Light of the World. 8 \n\nMarch 25 was also the day when Blessed Virgin Juno miraculous- \nly conceived her savior-son Mars by eating her own magic lily, which \nis why March was named after this god and why medieval France called \nLady Day Notre Dame de Mars. The date was officially Christian- \nized by the tenth Council of Toledo in 656 a.d. as the Festival of the \nMother of God. But its symbol remained a pagan sign of the yoni. 9 \nMars had a Phrygian counterpart, the satyr Marsyas, likewise hung on a \ntree, and likewise a son of Cybele. It was said that he and Attis were \nthe same god. 10 \n\nThe day of Attis\'s death was Black Friday, or the Day of Blood. \nHis image was carried to the temple and bound to the tree, escorted \nby "reed-bearers" (cannophori) with the reed scepters representing re- \ngenerated phalli and new fertility. 11 During the ceremonies, initiates \ncastrated themselves in imitation of the castrated god, and presented \ntheir severed genitals to the Goddess along with those of the gelded \nbull sacrificed at the Taurobolium. 12 All these male remnants were \ndeposited in the sacred cave of the Great Mother. 15 \n\nThe god died and was buried. He descended into the underworld. \nOn the third day he rose again from the dead. His worshippers were \ntold: "The god is saved; and for you also will come salvation from your \ntrials." 14 This day was the Carnival or Hilaria, also known as the Day \nof Joy. People danced in the streets and went about in disguise, \nindulging in horseplay and casual love affairs. 15 This was the Sun- \nday; the god arose in glory as the solar deity of a new season. Christians \never afterward kept Easter Sunday with carnival processions derived \nfrom the mysteries of Attis. Like Christ, Attis arose when "the sun \nmakes the day for the first time longer than the night." 16 \n\nNaassenes of the 3rd century a.d. worshipped Attis as a syncretic \nmixture of deities. One of their hymns said, "Of Attis I will sing, of \nRhea\'s son, not sounding his praises with rolling drums, nor on the reed, \nnor with the roar of Ida\'s Curetes, but as the Muse of Phoebus on the \nlyre I will blend the strains. Euhoi, Euhan, he is Pan, he is Bacchus, he \nis the shepherd of the white constellations." 17 \n\nInscriptions of the 4th century gave Attis the title of Menotyrannus, \nfrom Greek tyrannos, "lord," plus Men or Mennu, Osiris as the \nresurrected, ithyphallic moon-bull, "the Lord Who Impregnates His \nMother." 18 \n\n\n\n78 \n\n\n\nPagans sometimes celebrated the Hilaria at the end of their Holy \nWeek, bringing it to April 1 and the carnival of the April Fool, or \nCarnival King, or Prince of Love, all originally synonymous with Attis. \nHe was also identified with Green George of the old Roman Palilia, \nhonored on Easter Monday with sacrificial hanging of the god\'s effigy \non a sacred tree. People of the 18th century still said the 25th of \nMarch used to be New Year\'s Day, while April 1 stood at the "octaves" \nterminating the sacred week. 19 \n\nSome Christians claimed Jesus\'s crucifixion took place on April 1, \nso the Fool of the April Fool\'s Day processions became Christ \ncarrying his cross and enduring the mockery of the mob. But the spring \nHoly Week was not really Christian. Its origin was a universal Indo- \nEuropean tradition of extreme antiquity, probably traceable to the Holi \nfestivals of India which celebrated the rebirth of spring with joyous \norgies. 20 \n\n1.

Oracles were augustae \nin the semi-matriarchal "republican" period. The term was later applied \nto male priests, then to emperors. An "august" man was one filled \nwith the spirit of the Goddess. 1 Augur, the old name for a seer, meant \n"increaser," once referring to the mother-priestess. 2 The first emper- \nor Augustus took his title from the Great Mother of the Gods, \npresumed incarnate in his wife Livia Augusta. Their house stood \nopposite the temple of the Great Mother, whom Augustus honored as \nthe national Goddess. 3 \n\nAmong European pagans the month of August began with one of \nthe Goddess\'s major festivals, Lammas Eve, from Hlaf-mass, "the \nFeast of Bread." The secret worship of Ops, Ceres, Demeter, or Juno \nAugusta continued throughout the Middle Ages in the rites ad- \ndressed to the Lammas corn-mother who ruled the harvest-month. \n"For a seventeenth-century Scot to say \'he (or she) was born in \nAugust\', was to imply high praise and recognition of a well-skilled \nperson\'. August, the month of the Lammas towers, the month when \nthe Irish dancers moved around the female effigy, was the right time for \nbirth. Then the Lammas moon was at work, on behalf of new \nchildren, and the new harvest." 4 \n\nChurchmen repeatedly tried to obliterate the Goddess\'s connec- \ntions with her harvest month.

Every god was a Baal. The title was introduced into Ireland \nvia Phoenician colonies in Spain, and became the Irish Bel or Bial, Lord \nofBeltain. 1 \n\nOld Testament Jews worshipped many baalim as past or present \nconsorts of the Goddess Zion (Hosea 2:2-8). Yahweh shared these other \ngods\' temples for a long time, until his priesthood managed to isolate his \ncult and suppress the others. 2 Some of the baalim revered in Israel \nwere: Sin, the moon god of Sinai; Molech (Melek), the "king" and sun \ngod of Tyre; Horus, the Egyptian Golden Calf whose image was \nmade by Aaron; Baal-Peor, a phallic "Lord of the Cleft" (or yoni); \nNehushtan, the "fiery flying serpent" of lightning, made by Moses (2 \nKings 18:4); Chemosh, the Babylonian sun god Shamash, incarnate in \nSamson (or Shams-on, the sun); Melchizedek, the god of Salem; \nEtana, or Ethan, the Canaanite Eytan who "went up to heaven"; Baal- \nRimmon, the Lord of the Pomegranate impersonated by Solomon; \nBaal-Berith, the Canaanites\' "God of the Covenant"; El, or Elias, the \nsun god Helios to whom Jesus called from the cross; Joseph, Jacob, \nand Israel, who were not men but tribal gods. 2 \n\nSince nearly all gods were sacrificial victims in their earthly \nincarnations, Baal may have been derived from Sanskrit Bala or Bali, \na sacrificial offering. 5 The Semitic melek, "king," came from Phoeni- \ncian molk, a votive offering, because early kings were not only gods \nbut also victims. 4 (See Kingship.) \n\nBaal was often used as the title of a mortal king, especially one \nwhose reign might be terminated by a ritual sacrifice. In the time of \nEsarhaddon of Assyria, the king of Tyre was named Baal, or "God." In \nthe 10th century B.C., kings of Byblos bore names like Yehimilk \n(God-king), Abibaal (Father-god), and Baalshamen (Heavenly Father). 5 \n\nBaal became a favorite Christian name for a devil, because biblical \nwriters denounced all the baalim indiscriminately as devils (2 Chroni- \ncles 1 1:15; 1 Corinthians 10:20; Revelation 9:20). Still, the northern \nEuropean cognate Bal, Bel, Bael, or Balder retained the affection of \ncommoners. 6 Baal was still the patron of the Beltain feast in 18th- \ncentury Scotland. To make the crops thrive, Scandinavians burned \nhis effigy at midsummer in "Balder\'s Balefires" throughout Denmark, \nNorway, and Sweden. 7 \n\n1. Joyce, 279. 2. Reinach, 201; Frazer,G.B., 341. 3.

Commandments on \n\nthe tablets were based on the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, received \n\nby the Babylonian king from the god Shamash. 1 These, in turn, were \n\nbased on the tablets of law given the first god by his Great Mother, \n\nTiamat. 2 \n\nThough both tablets and title were claimed by the Judeo-Christian \nGod, the name of Baal-Berith was attached to a devil, often invoked \nby medieval authors on magic, who were apparently unaware that they \ncalled upon the God of the Covenant. Weyer placed Baal-Berith in a \nposition suiting his ancient function, however. In the royal hierarchy of \nhell he was Minister of Treaties. 3 Though churchmen had small use \nfor the heretic Weyer, yet they used this precedent to assign the de- \nmonic pact to Baal-Berith. In 1335a witch named Catherine Delort \nwas burned for signing a pact with "the demon Berit." 4 \n\n1. Hooke, M.E.M* 142, 147. 2. Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 287. \n3. Waite, B.C.M., 186-87. 4. J.B.

Beelzebub \n\n\n\nBaal-Zebub \n\n"Lord of Flies," a god of Ekron in Philistia, to whose oracle King \nAhaziah of Israel sent messengers in quest of healing magic (2 Kings \n1:2). Like Hermes Psychopomp, his title meant the same as Lord of \nDeath or Conductor of Souls, because flies were common forms taken \nby souls in search of rebirth. Mothers of many mythic heroes \nmiraculously conceived them by swallowing their souls in fly shape. 1 \nEtain, legendary Irish queen married to Ochy Airem, and Cu \nChulainn are examples from popular Celtic myth. \n\nThe Pharisees called Baal-Zebub a "prince of devils," apparently \nbecause it was thought he could cure people possessed by lesser devils \n(Matthew 12:24). One or two passing references to this "prince of \ndevils" in the New Testament sufficed to establish Beelzebub as an \nalternative name for Satan, and flies as diabolic manifestations in \nmedieval Christendom. \n\nSt. Bernard once exorcised a cloud of flies, which instantly \ndropped dead at the sound of his holy words and had to be shoveled \nout of his church in heaps. 2 \n\nFly-devils were still firmly believed in during the late 16th century. \nWhen a young Viennese girl suffered from cramps in 1 583, Jesuit \npriests diagnosed her case as demonic possession.

The ziggurat restored by \nNebuchadnezzar was a "temple of the seven spheres of the world." It \nhelped established universal belief in the seven heavens, corresponding \nto the seven planetary spheres. Christians and Moslems also adopted \nthis view of the cosmos. The Koran says Allah made seven heavens and \nseven underground spheres, the seven hells. 4 \n\nWhen ziggurats were abandoned and became ruinous, their mud- \nbrick construction crumbling, later nomadic peoples assumed the \ngods were angered by the pride of the elder races and broke down their \nheaven-aspiring constructions. The Babel myth is found all over the \nworld, including India and Mexico. It was familiar in the Greek story of \nthe giants who piled up mountains to reach heaven. Hindus said it \nwas not a tower but a great tree that grew up to heaven, angering \nBrahma, who cut off its branches and threw them down. From each \nbranch grew a separate wata tree that gave humanity another separate \nlanguage. 5 \n\nBerossus said the Babylonian heaven-mountain was destroyed by \nwinds, which blew a diversity of tongues among men. The first part \nof this premise was certainly not irrational, since drying and wind- \nerosion were major causes of the destruction of mud-brick structures. \nBerossus\'s story surfaced many centuries later in the Armenian myth of \nthe holy mountain built by giants. It was blown down by winds, while \n"unknown words were at the same time blown about among men." 6 \n\nThe same story was told in the western hemisphere. Choctaw \nIndians said their own ancestors piled up stones to build a mountain \nthat would reach heaven, but it was blown down by winds, whereupon \npeople found themselves speaking different languages. 7 In Central \nAmerica the heaven-reaching pyramid of Cholula was built by giants un- \nder the leadership of Xelhua. The angry gods broke it down with light- \nning and sent different, mutually incomprehensible languages to earth. 8 \n\n1. White 2, 170. 2.Hcx)ke,M.E.M., 138. 3. Eliade, M.E.R., 14. \n4.

Sometimes \nthey were ordinary \ncakes marked with a \nsymbol of the sacrifice, \nlike the Christian \nhost (from Latin hostia, \n"victim"). \n\n\n\nBalder \n\nNorwegian name for the god Bel, or Baal, sacrificed as a son of \nFather Odin. He descended into the womb of Mother Hel, the \nUnderworld. At doomsday, Ragnarok, he would return to earth in \nSecond Coming. He would establish a new earth and a new heaven \nafter the passing of the old destructive gods and their world. \n\nBalder\'s effigy is still burned at Beltain fires in Scotland and \nIreland. Scandinavians knew them as Balder\'s Balefires. His was the \nspirit inhabiting the Beltain cake, an effigy of god-flesh like the Christian \nhost, sometimes man-shaped like the symbolic dough "victims" of \nthe Far East. 1 Such pagan hosts probably gave rise to the living \nGingerbread Man of the fairy tale. 2 \n\nLike Heracles, Siegfried, and other solar heros, Balder stood for \nthe idea of regeneration through cremation. His funeral was the \nViking\'s dissolution in both fire and water; he was sent to sea on a \nburning ship. This was arranged by a Goddess called Hyrrokkin, \n"Fire-shrunk," one of the Elder Deities.

"When the banshee \nloves those she calls, the song is a low, soft chant giving notice, \nindeed, of the proximity of death but with a tenderness of tone that \nreassures the one destined to die and comforts the survivors; rather a \nwelcome than a warning." 4 To others, she came like a bad death, full of \nhorror. \n\n1.

Shah, 225.2. Knight, S.L., 202. \n\n\n\nBaptism \n\nIn 418 a.d., a Catholic church council decided that every human \nchild is born demonic as a result of its sexual conception, thus automati- \ncally damned unless baptized. 1 During a Catholic baptismal \nceremony the priest still addresses the baby, "I exorcise thee, thou \nunclean spirit. . . . Hear thy doom, O Devil accursed, Satan ac- \ncursed!" 2 The exorcism is euphemistically described as "a means to \nremove impediments to grace resulting from the effects of original sin \nand the power of Satan over fallen nature." 3 But it is obvious from the \nfolk belief still widespread, that the church\'s teaching was that every \nnewborn infant before baptism belonged to the devil. 4 St. Augustine\'s \ndoctrine of original sin laid the foundation for this idea, and Tertul- \nlian said every baby is born evil; its soul is "unclean" and "actively \nsinful" before baptism. 5 Medieval theologians held that any infant still \nin the womb is doomed to eternal damnation. 6 The Oedipal jealousies \nof men apparently developed these ideas, since few women would \nhave pictured babies screaming in an eternity of torture in hellfire, \nsimply because no priest had sprinkled them with water before they \nperished. \n\nIndeed, priests refused to baptize a child within forty days of its \nbirth, for both mother and infant were considered impure (hence too \ndangerous for priests to touch) during that period. "An unbaptized \nchild, as well as a woman between childbirth and churching, was \ndesignated as heathen." 7 The real reason for this "heathenism" appears \nin numerous folk beliefs: it was the birth magic of the ancient \nGoddess that claimed both women and their infants in the performance \nof her Mysteries. In the north it is still said that children dying \nunbaptized go to Frau Holda, or Hel, or Perchta, the underground \nMother. 8 In the Hebrides, the Goddess\'s protective ritual is still used \nto preserve children during the perilous pre-baptismal period: a torch is \ndaily carried around the cradle as in old pre-Christian custom. 9 Some \ntraditional ballads deny the Catholic doctrine that women dying in \nchildbed or infants dying unbaptized must go to hell; they claim, \nrather, that such individuals pass into a pagan heaven. Mexican peasants \nstill say they go to "a place of delight in the temple of the sun." 10 \n\nThus, paganism was kinder to infants and their mothers than \nChristianity, so that theologians often felt called upon to explain \nGod\'s apparent cruelty in allowing infants to die unbaptized, so con- \ndemning them before they had a chance for salvation. In the 16th \nand 17th centuries, churchmen insisted that God\'s cruelty was perfectly \njust. Said Martin Del Rio, S.J.: "If, as is not uncommon, God permits \n\n\n\n90 \n\n\n\nchildren to be killed before they have been baptized, it is to prevent their Barabbas \n\ncommitting in later life those sins which would make their damnation Barbara, Saint \n\nmore severe. In this, God is neither cruel nor unjust, since, by the mere ^^^^^^^^^^ \nfact of original sin, the children have already merited death." n \n\nIt was customary to refuse baptism altogether to those thought to \nhave been conceived out of wedlock, or sinfully. American church- \nmen often refused to baptize children born on Sunday, because it was \nthought children were always born on the same day of the week as \ntheir conception, and marital relations on Sunday were forbidden. 12 \n\nModern theologians have trouble explaining why baptism should \nbe necessary. Few educated parents seriously believe their infants are \ndoomed to eternal torture unless splashed with a little water in a church. \nThe biblical "fall" that provided the original rationale has long since \nbeen relegated to the realm of myth. 13 The primitive notion of the \npublic name-giving ritual seems to be all that is left to justify the \nformalities: no more than an excuse for people to dress up and get \ntogether, to celebrate a new life in the clan. Perhaps it should be \nremembered that this function was once the exclusive concern of \nmothers and Goddesses. \n\n1. H. Smith, 238. 2. de Givry, 157. 3. Encyc. Brit, "Exorcism." \n4.

Within the mountain dwelt the \nheathen dead, "bewitched men and women" who spent their time in \ndancing, lovemaking, and other pleasures until the day of doom. 1 In \nother words, St. Barbara was none other than the Fairy Queen. \n\nAs a spurious martyr, Barbara followed the usual pattern: she was a \nbeautiful virgin, tortured by her evil pagan father to make her \nrenounce Christianity. She remained steadfast, so her father killed her. \nThen God struck the father dead with a lightning bolt, unfortunately \na few minutes too late to save Barbara.

He was inserted into the Gospels as an apostle, but hagiogra- \nphers gave him a different origin. He was called a son of "Prince \nPtolomeus," crucified in Armenia, and flayed like the satyr Marsyas (see \nMars). Icons showed him holding a moon-sickle, the sacrificial knife \nof the Middle East. 1 \n\nAn alternative history made Bartholomew a missionary to India, \nwhere he overthrew the idols of the oddly non-Indian deities Astarte \nand Baal-Berith. With many miracles, Bartholomew converted the \nking of that country to Christianity, but the king\'s brother was \nunaccountably permitted to crucify, flay, and behead the saint \nafterward. 2 \n\nSpurious relics of the saint were installed in the Roman healing \nshrine of Asclepius, which was taken over by Christians and remained \nthe Hospital of San Bartolommeo up to the 20th century.* \n\n1.

As the serpent-haired \nGorgon head represented women\'s "wise blood" and guarded men- \nstrual mysteries that men were forbidden to behold, so there was a \npopular medieval belief that a hair taken from the head of a menstru- \nating woman and buried in the earth would turn into a serpent or \nbasilisk. 1 Superstitious folk supposed that all the serpents on the \nGorgon\'s head were basilisks, which derived their evil eyes from her \nown deadly glance. \n\nl.Rawson.A.T., 165-66. \n\n\n\nBassareus \n\nLydian fox god, a totemic form of Orpheus or Dionysus, whose \nMaenads were sometimes called Bassarids because they wore fox \n\n\n\n92 \n\n\n\nskins. 1 As a pagan deity, the fox became the popular trickster-hero of \nmedieval folklore, where he appeared as Reynard or Renaud.

Herodotus said that in Egypt, "All cats that die are \ncarried to certain sacred houses, where being first embalmed, they are \nburied in the city of Bubastis." \' The Greeks identified Bast with \nArtemis or Diana, also called the mother of cats, and claimed the great \nshrine of Bubastis was built in her honor. 2 The cat\'s legendary nine \nlives stemmed from Artemis as the mother of the nine Muses, corre- \nsponding to the Egyptian Ennead of nine primordial deities.

In Rome, each paterfamilias went \nthrough an annual ceremony of exorcising ancestral spirits by throwing \nbeans behind him at midnight, nine times enjoining the manes to \nleave the house. 2 \n\nAnother Roman ceremony on the twelfth day after the midwinter \nsolstice (Epiphany) recalled ancient customs of choosing a sacred \nking. It was called the Festival of Kings Created or Elected by Beans, \nthe beans evidently representing women, the choosing carried out by \ndrawing black or white beans. Later, dice were used, and a ceremonial \nking-for-the-night called Basilicus was chosen by the "Venus" throw. \nThe ceremony persisted in medieval England, where the Twelfth- \nNight plum cake contained one bean, and the man who received the \nbean was declared king of the festival. 3 \n\nSome overlapping esoteric meanings of beans may be found in the \nSanskrit word mudra, "kidney beans," also "woman," and a "magical \ngesture," the benevolent spell cast by a Shakti. 4 The influx of Tantric \nsymbols into medieval Europe probably gave rise to Jack\'s beanstalk, \nresembling the Ladder of Heaven in that it was a soul-bridge: "the myth \n\n\n\n93 \n\n\n\nBeata of the vine that once joined earth and sky," in the paradisal time \n\nBehemoth when men knew the way to heaven or thought they did. 5 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ 1.

Sometimes \nthey were persecuted for heresy and witchcraft. \n\n\n\nBeelzebub \n\nSee Baal-zebub. \n\nBehemoth \n\nBiblical name of the Indian elephant god Ganesha, the "Lord of \nHosts." \' His title was adopted by the Jewish Jehovah, during the period \nwhen he was married to the Virgin Goddess Anath, or Neith, in the \ntemple of Elephantine in Egypt. Jewish mercenaries stationed there wor- \nshipped the elephant-headed, virgin-born Lord of Hosts as their own \nYaho (or, Yahweh). 2 At the time, the Jewish God was a subordinate \nspouse of the Goddess who was hailed as "Queen of Heaven and \nmistress of all the gods." 3 \n\nThe same Virgin Goddess was the mother, as well as the bride, of \nthe elephant bull-god, according to the standard myth of divine incest \ncreated by identification of Father and Son. In India the mother of \nGanesha was Parvati, virgin form of Kali. She made him from her \nown "body-dew" (menstrual blood). A true archetypal son, he guarded \nher "gate" (yoni) against the entrance of All-father Shiva. For this \nOedipal offense he was slain, but resurrected. 4 Upon the same virgin \nmother under her other name of Maya (comparable to Mari, the \nother name of Anath), he begot the next incarnation of the Son of the \nLord of Hosts: Buddha, the Enlightened One. \n\nThe elephant-god was not forgotten by the Jews, but he was \ndissociated from the later concept of Yahweh, and diabolized. He \nbecame the demon Behemoth. In this guise he appeared in medieval \ndemonologies and grimoires, still wearing the elephant head of Shiva- \nGanesha. 5 \n\nYet traces of the earlier divine elephant could be found in Jewish \ntradition. Rabbinical sources said the Passover feast commemorated \nmore than one god. The lamb stood for the Firstborn. The fish \nrepresented Leviathan, the original wise serpent-deity of Levites. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n\n\nThe hard-boiled egg represented Ziz, or Aziz, or Azazel, the god of \natonement sacrifices.

Through \nwearing the bear\'s skin, a warrior acquired the bear\'s fighting spirit \nand the grace of the ursine Goddess who was often a teacher of the \nmartial arts. "Berserk" came to mean one possessed by battle-frenzy, \ncareless of his own safety, unable to feel fear. \n\nTotemic descent from the She-Bear characterized several old \nEuropean clans. The Orsini or Ursini family were "bear\'s children," \ncarrying a bear on their coat of arms. William of Auvergne, bishop of \nParis in the 16th century, solemnly explained the origin of the Orsinis \nby saying a bear\'s semen is very like a man\'s, therefore it was quite \npossible for a bear to beget human children, presumably on a human \n\n\n\n95 \n\n\n\nBible mother. 1 The story reflects contemporary theological opinion that only \n\na male can be a true parent. Nothing was said about a she-bear\'s \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m ovum being like a woman\'s, nor was there a human father who might \nhave begotten children on a bear mother. \n\n1. Summers, W, 243. \n\n\n\nBible \n\nThis word for a holy book came from Byblos, the City of the Great \nMother, the oldest continuously occupied temple in the world. The \nGoddess called Astarte, Baalat, Hathor, etc. patronized learning, \nand her priestesses collected a library of papyrus scrolls. Therefore, \nGreeks called any papyrus byblos, which came to mean any holy \nbook. Hence the "Bible." \' \n\nScholars have found in the Bible\'s numerous layers of additions \nand corrections a substrate of the former Semitic matriarchy, such as \nthe Book of Ruth with its matrilineal and matrilocal marriage customs, \nand the Book of Judges with its feminine government of Israel \n(Judges 4:4). In several books the word translated "God" is really a \nfeminine plural, "Goddesses," especially in reference to the matriar- \nchal functions of lawgiving, avenging crimes, and bestowing the \nimperium of leadership. 2 \n\nSome of the miracles attributed to biblical heroes were copied from \nolder myths of the Goddess. Joshua\'s arrest of the sun was formerly \ncredited to priestesses of Isis, Hecate, and the Thessalian Great Mother, \nwho were said to stop heavenly bodies in their courses, and lengthen \nnight or day at will. 3 Moses\'s flowering rod, river of blood, and tablets of \nthe law were all symbols of the ancient Goddess. His miracle of \ndrawing water from a rock was first performed by Mother Rhea after she \ngave birth to Zeus, and by Atalanta with the help of Artemis. 4 His \nmiracle of drying up waters to travel dry-shod was earlier performed by \nIsis, or Hathor, on her way to Byblos. 5 \n\nThe greatest mistake of religious authorities in the western \nworld was their view of the Bible as intrinsically different from other \nancient scriptures, in that it was dictated word for word by God, not \ncollected slowly, rewritten and mis-written, revised and worked over by \nhuman beings for a long time. The notion that the Bible did not \nevolve haphazardly, like most other holy writings of the same period, \npersisted almost up to the present day, even among people who \nshould have known better. \n\nAccording to the prevailing myth of biblical origins, the Old \nTestament was supposed to have been translated from Hebrew to \nGreek by seventy-two translators sent to Ptolemy by Eleazar, a Jewish \nhigh priest, in the 3rd century B.C., hence its name, Septuagint. \nPtolemy locked the scholars in individual cells on the island Pharos, \nwhere each one made his own Greek version in exactly seventy-two \n\n\n\n96 \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndays. Each translation agreed exactly, in every word, with the other \nseventy-one translations. \n\nOf course this never happened. The Bible\'s real history was far less \ntidy. A collection appeared in the first century b.c. and again in the \nfirst century a.d. to be accepted by the Jews of the Diaspora as sacred, \nand passed on to Christians. In both Jewish and Christian hands the \npapyri underwent many changes. In the 4th century a.d., St. Jerome \ncollected some Hebrew manuscripts and edited them to produce the \nLatin Vulgate, a Bible of considerable inaccuracy, differing markedly \nfrom Jerome\'s stem texts. \n\nThe King James Bible relied mostly on a Greek text collected and \nedited by Erasmus in the 16th century, which in turn relied on a \nByzantine collection assembled gradually at Constantinople between \nthe 4th and 8th centuries. A few older texts have been discovered: the \nCodex Sinaiticus, the Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Alexandrinus, and \nthe Chester Beatty papyri. All are fragmentary, all differ from one \nanother and from the King James version. There are no known portions \nof the Bible older than the 4th century a.d. 6 \n\nThe Revised Version of the New Testament published in 1881 \ntried to correct some of the more glaring errors. It erased the spurious \nfinal twelve verses of Mark, which were late interpolations including the \nwords that caused centuries of suffering: "He that believeth not shall \nbe damned." It eliminated the fraudulent translation "Joseph and his \nmother," intended to preserve the dogma of the virgin birth, and \nrestored the original "his father and his mother." It omitted the forged \ninterpolation intended to preserve the dogma of the trinity: "For \nthere are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and \nthe Holy Ghost: and these three are one." These words appeared \nnowhere before the 1 5th century a.d. However, the Catholic church \ninsisted on retaining the forgery. Churchmen\'s argument was: "How, \nif these verses were an interpolation, could the Holy Spirit, who guides \nand directs the Church, have allowed her to regard this lofty affirma- \ntion of the Trinity as authentic, and permitted its insertion in the official \nedition of the sacred books?" In 1897 the Congregation of the Index, \nwith the approval of Pope Leo XIII, forbade any further research into \nthe origins of this text. 7 \n\nTraditionally, the church forbade not only research but even \nreading of the Bible by laymen. Throughout the Middle Ages, \npossession of a Bible written in the vernacular was a crime punished by \nburning at the stake. 8 With the Reformation came Bible-reading in \nsearch of a new basis for faith; but in the process were found many new \ngrounds for skepticism. \n\nRichard Simon\'s 17th-century Critical History of the Old Testa- \nment exhibited the now well-known internal evidence that the books \nof Moses were not written by Moses but were compiled by many hands \nat a much later date. Bishop Bossuet pronounced this work of \nscholarship "a mass of impieties," drove its author out of the Oratory, \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\n97 \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\nMaurice Jones \n\nAuthor of The New \nTestament in the \nTwentieth Century, \n1934. \n\n\n\nand ordered the entire first edition burned. Dr. Alexander Geddes, a \nCatholic scholar, translated the Old Testament in 1792 with a critical \nvolume proving that the Pentateuch could not have been written by \nMoses, nor at any time prior to the reign of David. He was denounced \nas "a would-be corrector of the Holy Ghost." 9 \n\nAs the years passed, it became increasingly clear that the Holy \nGhost needed correcting. Seven clerical scholars published Essays \nand Reviews in 1860, defining the new science of Bible criticism. They \nwere denounced, and two were suspended from office; but they took \ntheir case to court, and won. In 1 869 Kuenen\'s The Religion of Israel \nestablished Bible criticism as a valid field of investigation. He was \nfollowed by many others in Holland, Germany, and France. In 1889 \nthe book of biblical essays called Lux Mundi gave up all pretense of \nthe scriptures\' historicity or divine inspiration, admitting that the Bible is \na confused mass of myth, legend, and garbled history, often contra- \ndicting provable facts. 10 \n\nNaturally, there was constant opposition to the efforts of the \nscholars. Many 19th-century churchmen insisted that the Bible\'s only \nauthor was God. Dean Burgon said, "The Bible is the very utterance of \nthe Eternal; as much God\'s own word as if high heaven were open \nand we heard God speaking to us with human voice. Every book is in- \nspired alike, and is inspired entirely." Dr. Baylee said the Bible is \n"infallibly accurate; all its histories and narrations of every kind are \nwithout any inaccuracy." Dr. Hodge declared that the books of the \nBible are "one and all, in thought and verbal expression, in substance, \nand in form, wholly the work of God, conveying with absolute \naccuracy and divine authority all that God meant to convey without \nhuman additions and admixtures." 11 Apparently none of these gen- \ntlemen were familiar with the earlier contradictory texts; nor had they \nread the Bible closely enough to see the many passages where God \ncontradicted himself. \n\nThe real point was that organized religions had an economic \ninterest in maintaining literal interpretation of biblical myths. Guigne- \nbert says, "The doctrine of the inerrancy of the Bible . . . necessarily \nplaced theology in an attitude of surly and sanguinary hostility toward \nthe exact and experimental sciences, which it will not abandon save \nmost reluctantly and after as much delay as possible. . . . [Mjethods \nhave changed, the illusions still current have decreased, but its spirit is \nscarcely altered." 12 \n\nWhen the theologians began to give in, they complained that \nviewing the Bible as myth would destroy the whole structure that \ntheir livelihood and self-respect depended on. After David Straus\'s \nLebenjesu disposed of the historicity of the Gospel stories, and \nRenan\'s Vie de Jesus showed that the Gospels cannot be taken as literal \ntruth but only as romantic symbolism, the Rev. Maurice Jones \nexclaimed, "If the Christ-Myth theory is true, and if Jesus never lived, \n\n\n\n98 \n\n\n\nthe whole civilized world has for close upon two thousand years lain Bible \n\nunder the spell of a lie." 13 The Archbishop of Canterbury found it \nimpossible to deny the Bible\'s apparent lies, and began to backtrack _. \n\nwith his plaintive question, "May not the Holy Spirit make use of myth \nand legend?" 14 \n\nObviously the Bible was full of myths and legends, but most \northodox theologians had no idea of their meaning. One reason was \nthat they didn\'t study the corresponding myths and legends of other \ncultures ancient paganism, modern mysticism, the non-Christian \nbeliefs of people both civilized and uncivilized throughout the rest of \nthe world. Christian missionaries thought theirs was the only pipeline \nto divinity, the deities of all other people throughout the world were \ndevils, and the myths of the Bible were absolutely true whereas all \nother myths were absolutely false. \n\nNowadays such crude beliefs seem no less superstitious than the \nprimitive animisnvthat the missionaries sought to destroy. Yet an \neven darker blot on the history of Christian missions was their arrogant \nvandalism burning books and artworks, smashing images, forbid- \nding the songs and poems of heathen tradition instead of listening and \nrecording them in order to understand the people, to display a decent \nrespect for what alien races held sacred, as the pagan Romans did in the \ndays of their empire. It may well have been that, had the missionaries \nbeen willing to listen and learn, they would have discovered the \nmythology of the Bible all over again in other offshoots from its \noriginal sources; for all peoples, nearly everywhere in the world, shared \nthe same fables of the creation, the flood, the magic garden with its \ntree of life and its primal couple, the wise serpent, the heaven-piercing \ntower, the divided waters, the chosen people, the virgin mothers, the \nsaviors, and all the rest. It has been said both testaments of the Bible are \nonly recent and relatively corrupt derivations from a world-wide cycle \nof archetypal myths. 15 \n\nLeast of all were righteous Christians prepared to understand \nthat their awe of the Bible rested on a foundation of magical supersti- \ntion: it was, and is, a fetish. Legal oaths were taken in physical contact \nwith a Bible because of a very primitive belief in its destructive mana, \nwhich would automatically punish perjurors. Both Jews and Chris- \ntians used their Bible for divination, just as a witch might use a crystal \nball, an African might use a thunder-stone, or a Roman augur might \nuse the sacred chickens. Bibliomancy (taking omens from the Bible) was \nsometimes deplored, but from the 4th to the 14th centuries was \n"repeatedly practiced by Kings, Bishops, and Saints." 16 St. Augustine \nfrankly recommended taking omens from the Bible "in all cases of \nspiritual difficulty." 17 Even in this "enlightened" age, in both Europe \nand America, the Bible is still used to give omens. 18 \n\nA favorite biblical method for discovering a thief easily lent itself to \nconscious legerdemain. The name of the accused was written on a \n\n\n\n99 \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\nRobert Ingersoll \n\n(1833-1899) American \nlawyer and lecturer, \nAttorney General of the \nstate of Illinois; an \noutspoken popularizer \nof Bible criticism. \n\nJosephine Henry \n\n19th-century Kentucky \nsuffragist and pam- \nphleteer, active in the \nwomen\'s rights \nmovement. \n\nElizabeth Cady \n\nStanton (1815-1902) \nOne of the leaders of \nthe women\'s rights \nmovement in the \nU.S.; an associate of \nSusan B.

The diviner recited Psalm 50:18: "When thou \nsawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker \nwith adulterers." The guilt of the accused was proven if the key was \nfound turned around afterward. 19 \n\nDespite the many discoveries and clarifications made by biblical \nscholars in the last century or so, the average Christian\'s attitude \ntoward the Bible is still hardly more sophisticated than this simple- \nminded magic. Most churchmen see to it that their congregations are \nnot told the true origins of biblical myths. The most primitive or \nunattractive of these are constantly re-interpreted as deep allegories \nor metaphorical fables, intended by their divine author to wait two \nthousand years or more for a correct explanation. Yet the real \nexplanation of the sources of these stories, uncovered by the careful \nresearches of the higher critics, is seldom mentioned. Likewise \nignored are many of the truly awkward passages such as "Thou shalt not \nsuffer a witch to live," or God\'s frequent commands to wage \nmerciless war, which no amount of exegesis can fit into a more tolerant \nethic. 20 \n\nErroneous but traditional views of Bible origins and meanings are \ndoggedly preserved by male chauvinists in particular, since the \ncanonical books were deliberately selected and edited to wipe out all \nfeminine images of divinity and sanction religious suppression of \nwomen. Robert Ingersoll pointed out that "As long as woman regards \nthe Bible as the charter of her rights, she will be the slave of man." Jo- \nsephine Henry grumbled, "The Bible records that God created woman \nby a method different from that employed in bringing into life any \nother creature, then cursed her for seeking knowledge." Elizabeth \nStanton said there is no escape from the Bible\'s "degrading teaching" \nas to the position of women, and advised women to boycott churches. \n"It is not commendable for women to get up fairs and donation \nparties for churches in which the gifted of their sex may neither pray, \npreach, share in the offices and honors, nor have a voice in the \nbusiness affairs, creeds and discipline, and from whose altars come forth \nBiblical interpretations in favor of woman\'s subjection." 21 \n\nOne of the erroneous notions that still keep Christian women \nshackled to their Bible-based "inferior" image is the notion that \nChristianity was founded on the New Testament, when in fact the early \nchurches had no Gospels but rather created and produced their \nown. 22 Not only did churchmen falsely pretend an apostolic origin for \ntheir scriptures; they also weeded out all references to female author- \nity or participation in Christian origins. 23 Only the forbidden Gnostic \nGospels retained hints that Jesus had 12 female disciples correspond- \ning to the 12 male disciples, or that Mary Magdalene was the leader of \nthem all. Even women\'s scholarship was denied. St. Jerome openly \nadmitted that his co-authors of the Vulgate were two learned women; \n\n\n\n100 \n\n\n\nbut later scholars erased the women\'s names and substituted the \nwords "venerable brothers." 24 \n\nl.Encyc.Brit, "Byblos." 2.

Latin aves meant both "birds" \nand "ancestral spirits," or ghosts, or angels. Roman emperors \nachieved godhood in the form of an eagle which was released above an \nemperor\'s funeral pyre to carry his soul to heaven. 1 Similarly, an \nEgyptian pharaoh\'s spirit rode aloft, on, or in, the solar hawk of Horus \nreleased at his funeral. Like Phoenix, he passed through the Fire and \nwas reborn with wings. Based on such prototypes, the souls of Christian \nsaints ascended to heaven in the form of white doves released at the \ncanonization ceremony. 2 \n\nBecoming a bird in a visionary or trance state was a widespread \nsymbol of initiatory death and rebirth. Shamans and prophets in the \nSouth Pacific, Indonesia, Central Asia, and Siberia claimed to transform \nthemselves into birds. Buddhist yogis said ecstatic flight was the first \nmagical power to be developed by the practice of yoga. "Becoming a \nbird oneself or being accompanied by a bird indicates the capacity, \nwhile still alive, to undertake the ecstatic journey to the sky and \nbeyond." 3 Celtic "fays" or "fairies" could change themselves into \nbirds, which is why they were depicted with wings like angels, and why \nwitches "flew" to the Sabbat. 4 \n\nThe Chinese said women knew the secret of flying before men \ndid. The emperor Shun first learned it from two princesses. "Down \nto a certain date the source of magical power lay in women ... an \nindication of an ancient Chinese matriarchy." In northern Europe \nalso, the Goddess Freya owned all the magic feather garments that \nenabled magicians to fly through the air like birds. 5 The elaborate \nfeather garments of Mayan and Aztec priesthoods probably had the \nsame original function, to facilitate their soul-flights. \n\nBecause birds traveled freely between the earthly and heavenly \nrealms, they were everywhere regarded as angelic messengers, givers \nof omens, possessors of occult secrets, as well as soul-carriers. Carrion \ncrows and vultures took souls to heaven. Storks brought them back to \nearth for rebirth. Wise owls told the secrets of the night; lustful doves \nand nightingales told the secrets of love. Angelic eagles foretold the \nfuture. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n\n\nBirds \n\n\n\nPhilo Judaeus (ca. 30 \nB.c-40 a.d.) Alexandrian \nJewish philosopher, \nstrongly influenced by \nHellenistic Platonism, \nPythagoreanism, and \nStoicism; author of \nbiblical commentaries, \ntracts, and histories. \n\n\n\nMyths repeatedly credit seers with power to understand the lan- \nguage of birds, usually because sacred serpents licked their ears to \n"open" them, as in the case of the Trojan prophetess Cassandra. 6 \nSiegfried likewise obtained the power to understand birds, via the \nmagic blood of the Great Serpent or dragon. A bird call, a magic \nformula, and singing were expressed by the same word in Germanic \nlanguages. 7 \n\nThe magpie was especially revered as an oracle. It was a picus \n(pecker) sacred to the Goddess Mag, or Magog, eponymous ances- \ntress of Scythian Magnetes, the Amazonian centaurs credited with \nprophetic powers. 8 In Rome, the magpie or woodpecker was a \ntotemic form of the god Mars, said to contain his soul between his \nincarnations as Maris or Faunus. \n\nIn Egypt the hawk represented the soul of Horus and of the \npharaoh who embodied him. Hawks came to stand for that portion of \nevery soul called the ba, which could come and go at will after death, \nflying freely in and out of the tomb. Narrow shafts were left open in pit \ngraves for the passage of the ba. Similar shafts in pyramids, sometimes \nmisconstrued as ventilation shafts, were originally intended to let the \nbird-soul of the deceased fly in and out. 9 \n\nThe bird-soul born out of the cremated body entered Egyptian \nmythology as the Phoenix, sometimes a man, sometimes a firebird. \nThe name was Greek, meaning "the Phoenician," a reference to \nsacrificed sacred kings of Astarte at Byblos, where they were frequent- \nly burned. 10 The cult moved to North Africa with Phoenician colonists, \nand was carried on at Carthage where sacred kings perished in flames \nto a very late date. 11 Their bird-souls, reborn from the flames and flying \nto heaven, gave rise to the myth of the Egyptian Phoenix who \nperiodically cremated himself and rose again from his ashes. His \nworshippers, identified with the god through his sacraments, partook \nof the same power of heavenly flight. A common expression for death \nwas "flying away." \n\nPhilo wrote of the sages\' soul-flights: "They accompany in thought \nthe Moon and Sun in their circuitings, the choirs of other planets and \nfixed stars, attached below to the ground by their bodies, but giving \nwings to their souls, so that, walking on the ether, they contemplate the \npowers they find there." Still known today as the yogic trance or out-of- \nbody experience, the soul-flight was often described in medieval \nbooks on Hermetic magic: "Nothing can obstruct, neither the Sun\'s fire \nnor the Ether nor the heaven\'s revolution nor the bodies of other \nstars; but, cutting across all space, the soul will ascend in its flight up to \nthe furthest heavenly body." 12 Bird lore has always clearly expressed \nman\'s envy of the power of flight and his longing to know what the \nworld looks like from high in the sky. \n\n1.

The system is still followed in some parts of the world. \nAmong the Hunza, pregnant or nursing women do not sleep with their \nhusbands. The Semai of Malaya think it correct to forbid sex during \nthe long nursing period, as this allows parents to space their children and \ngive adequate care to each one. 1 Even in an aggressive male- \ndominated society like the Yanomamo, men say they are afraid to have \nsexual intercourse with a nursing mother. \n\nSometimes modern people insult the animals by calling a human \nrapist an "animal." Animals don\'t rape. Sexual intercourse takes place \nonly when the female is receptive. When she is preoccupied with caring \nfor her young always her first priority the female shows no sexual \ninterest in the male. Should he be so ill-advised as to make sexual \ndisplays to her, she drives him away with bared teeth. \n\nThere is among animals no question of the use of force on the part \nof the male; the conjunction of the sexes is dependent upon the \nwillingness of the female. . . . And the female sexual instincts are subject \nto frequent and prolonged natural suspensions which do not always \ncorrespond with the operation of those instincts in the male. Among all \nherbivores the females, as soon as they are pregnant, retire from the \ncompany of the males to seek either complete seclusion and solitude, or to \ncollect in herds from which the males are excluded. Female elephants \ndrive away all males from the herds of cows and calves not only during the \nlong pregnancy of nearly two years, but throughout the period of \nlactation. The behavior is typical of animal females. Had the primitive \nhuman female admitted the male during menstruation, pregnancy, and \nlactation she would have departed from all biological precedents; her \nbehavior would have constituted an abnormality. 2 \n\nMany early records show that human females did not depart \nfrom biological precedent. Hippocrates and Galen supported the an- \ncient taboo on sex during pregnancy and lactation. There was a \ncurious remnant of the taboo even in a popular marriage manual of the \nearly 20th century, part of the vast body of sexual misinformation that \nour grandparents struggled with. The author declared that marital \nrelations during pregnancy would make the child epileptic. 3 \n\nIn most primitive societies it was unthinkable that male sexual \ndesires should take precedence over the needs of mothers and their \nchildren. 4 Patriarchy everywhere sought to change this, through reli- \ngious sanction. Women were to serve men\'s sexual urges even when \npreoccupied with motherhood. This was the meaning of God\'s an- \nnouncement to Eve: "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy \nconception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire \nshall be subject to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee" \n\n103 \n\n\n\nBirth Control (Genesis 3:16). In this context, "sorrow" meant labor pangs, as well as \n\nthe harried life of a mother with children too close together, and the \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m illnesses and injuries caused by spreading a mother\'s care too thin. \n\nThe Christian canon omitted the First Book of Adam and Eve, \nwhich contradicted the canonical scripture by stating that Eve stuck \nto the old system of birth control after all. She gave birth to Cain \nand his twin sister Luluwa, another incarnation of the lilu or "lily" \nwho was also Eve\'s predecessor Lilith. Then "when the days of \nnursing the children were ended" but not until then "Eve again \nconceived." She produced Abel and his twin sister. After Abel was \nkilled at the age of 15 years, Eve produced Seth to replace him. \n"After the birth of these, Eve ceased from childbearing." 5 Thus the \nentire human race descended from these four: Cain, Seth, and their \nsisters. According to this version of the story, Eve was not particu- \nlarly troubled by God\'s curse. \n\nHowever, later Judeo-Christian culture insisted on men\'s con- \ntrol of women\'s bodies. Wives were not to initiate sexual relations, but \nthey were never to deny their husbands. The Catholic church laid \ndown the law that no wife could accuse her husband of rape even if he \nforced her with accompanying brutality. Sexual "release" was his \nconjugal right (but not hers). \n\nThe church interpreted the fable of Genesis as God\'s mandate to \ncompel women to bear as many children as possible, even at the cost \nof the children\'s or the mothers\' physical health and welfare. 6 Men \nrefused to deal with the problem of over-production, and women \nwere forbidden to do so, by the church\'s tradition. In pagan times, \nwomen used some fairly effective birth-control devices, ranging from \nvaginal sponges to abortifacient drugs. Many churchmen believed the \nwitches inherited secret knowledge of such things, which contributed \nto the vigor of witch- and midwife-persecutions. \n\nFather Dominic Pruemmer recently wrote in American Freedom \nand Catholic Power: "Birth control is nothing else than mutual \nmasturbation or unnatural lust." 7 It is not usual to view the "lust" \nof marital partners for each other as unnatural. Nor did the church ever \nobject to sex as masturbation when it was for a husband\'s benefit \nonly that is, not mutually satisfying. In fact church-sanctioned litera- \nture of the 1 7th century said the only purpose of marital sex must be \nconception, and if a woman receives too much pleasure she cannot \nconceive. 8 \n\nThe church further taught women that their children belonged \nmore to God than to themselves, thus eroding the instinctive mater- \nnal possessiveness that fosters the best of child care. Not illogically, \nmothers often left their unwanted children for God to care for. In the \n1 8th century, the hospital of St. Vincent de Paul in Paris reported \nas many as 5000 infants annually deposited on God\'s doorstep. 9 Infant \ncorpses were rather commonly found among the rubbish of western \ncities. Foundling hospitals were so busy that they set revolving boxes in \n\n\n\n104 \n\n\n\ntheir walls, so infants could be passed through. Yet foundling hospi- Birth Control \n\ntals seldom saved the children they were given. In practice, they solved \n\nthe problem of excess births by killing babies by the thousands, under ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe sanction of male-dominated officialdom. 10 \n\nLondon\'s first foundling hospital admitted 1 5,000 infants in the \nfour years between 1756 and 1760. Of these, fewer than a third \nsurvived to adolescence. On the continent, the death rate for children in \nfoundling institutions ran between 80 and 90 percent during the first \nyear of life. Parish officers entrusted the care of newborns to women \nnicknamed "killing nurses," because they were expected to do the \nstate\'s dirty work, and see to it that the unwanted children did not long \nsurvive. 11 \n\nIn effect, the patriarchal society having outlawed birth control and \nabortion could find nothing better to do with the overflow than \ndestroy it after all. Apparently this was all right, as long as the decision to \ngive life or withhold it was not being made by the mothers them- \nselves. Vetter found this kind of morality puzzling: \n\nIs there any evidence that religion has provided a superior brand of \nwisdom for the guidance of secular affairs, or in the burning social \nissues of the day? With the population of the earth growing by geometric \nleaps from unchecked fertility but with epidemics and diseases well \nunder control, what religious leaders spoke up for the necessity of planned \nparenthood? Not one! But many did hound Margaret Sanger to prison \nfor her constructive work in that direction. IZ \n\nAn Englishwoman gave the following picture of conventional \nmorality in regard to reproduction, indicating that religious leaders care \nfor their own mythology and ceremonial well ahead of the future \nwelfare of the race: \n\nIn a village that I know well a woman, legally married, bore five idiot \nchildren one after the other; her husband was a confirmed drinker and \na mental degenerate. One of the children fortunately died. The text that \nwas chosen for his funeral card was "Of such is the kingdom of \nheaven. "About the same time in the same village a girl gave birth to an il- \nlegitimate child. She was a beautiful girl; the father, who did not live in \nthe village, was strong and young; probably the child would have been \nhealthy. But the girl was sent from her situation and, later, was driven \nfrom her home by her father. At the last she sought refuge in a disused \nquarry, and was there for two days without food. When we found her, \nher child had been born and was dead. Afterwards the girl went mad. n \n\nMargaret Sanger gave her life to the effort to prevent such \ntragedies, both within and without marriage. She believed that "excess \n\npeople, not acts of God, created poverty, famine, and war All \n\nsociety would gain . . . if birth control were allowed to shut off the spigot \nthat floods the world with weaklings. When sick and unfit mothers \nwere not forced to breed, there would be an end to unwanted children \nwho grow up to fill our prisons and asylums." 14 \n\nBut churches still doggedly opposed the right of women to \n\n\n\n105 \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male determine when, where, and how much they shall breed, largely \n\nbecause of the deep-seated male desire to control the life-giving miracle \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ m in which men play only a negligible part biologically. It can hardly be \ndenied that male-dominated religions were everywhere devoted to this \nend from their earliest inception. As a result, overpopulation threatens \nthe world with virtually unthinkable ecological and sociological dis- \nasters. 15 Even now, in the face of such disasters, religious leaders tend \nto the view that the faithful should multiply forever. \n\nl.Dentan,98. 2.

Brahmanas are \nprose commentaries on \nVedic scriptures, dated \nfrom 800 to 500 B.C. \n\n\n\nPadma Purana \n\n"Lotus Purana." Pura- \nnas are ancient \nSanskrit scriptures in \nverse, treating of cos- \nmologies, sacred \nhistories, and the na- \nture of the divine. \n\n\n\nRig Veda Foremost \nof the four Aryan scrip- \ntures written in Vedic \n(an older form of San- \nskrit), ca. 1500-1200 \nB.C., containing sacred \nmythology, hymns, \nand verses; literary \nfoundations of the \nVedic religion. \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male \n\nSince birth-giving was the only true mark of divinity in primitive \nbelief, the first gods to claim any sort of supremacy had to claim also the \nability to give birth. In fact, usurpation of the feminine power of \nbirth-giving seems to have been the distinguishing mark of the earliest \ngods. \n\nLacking vaginas, many gods gave birth from their mouths. Priests \nof Ra claimed their god gave birth to the first couple from his mouth. \nThe Satapatha Brahmana said the god Prajapati learned to give birth to \ncreatures from his mouth; but before he could manage it, he had to \nmake sacrifices to an older, higher power: the Goddess Svaha, Lady of \nSacrifices. According to the Padma Purana, a god named Sukra \n(Seed) was born from Shiva\'s penis, after living in Shiva\'s belly for a \nhundred years. However, this was not a proper maternal-type birth. \nSukra existed beforehand, and Shiva had to make himself pregnant by \nswallowing him. 1 \n\nThe Rig Veda spoke of a male creator who gave birth to the \nMother of Creation, then impregnated her, so she brought forth the \nrest of the universe. Brahmans tried to claim the Mother of All Gods \nwas born from Brahma\'s body, even though she was the mother of \nBrahma too. 2 Brahma was known as Lotus-Born, meaning he sprang \nfrom the primal Yoni, the Goddess Padma ("Lotus"). His first \nLotus Throne was located in her lap. The Rig Veda also called her Vac, \nthe Great Womb, the Queen, the First, the Greatest of All Deities. \nShe said: "I begot the All-Father on high. I dwell in the waters, the \ndeep, and thence extend through all creatures, and touch the heavens \nwith my crown. Like unto the wind I blow, encompassing all creatures; \nabove the heavens and above the earth." 3 \n\nHellenic Greeks pretended their new Father Zeus gave birth to the \nmuch older Goddess Athene from his head. But before he could \ngive birth to Athene, he had to swallow her real mother, Metis \n(Wisdom), who was pregnant with her at the time. 4 The Hellenes \nalso claimed Zeus gave birth to Dionysus from his thigh; but again, the \n\n\n\n106 \n\n\n\nreal mother was the Moon-goddess Selene, whom Zeus killed during Birth-Giving, Male \n\nher pregnancy. As Conductor of Souls, Hermes took the six-month \n\nfetus from Selene\'s womb and sewed him up in Zeus\'s thigh to \n\ncontinue his gestation. ^^^^^^^^ 11 \n\nA Greek carving showed the god Apollo sitting on a pile of eggs, \ntrying to copy the life-giving magic of his mother Leto, or Leda, or \nLatona, who gave birth to the World Egg and hatched it. 5 This World \nEgg was an old Oriental idea. The Satapatha Brahmana said it \ncontained "the continents, the oceans, the mountains, the planets and \nthe divisions of the universe, the gods, the demons, and humanity." 6 \nThus, birth laying the egg was the image of cosmic creation, and \ncreator-gods needed to copy it. In Egypt, the mother of the World \nEgg was Hathor in the guise of the Nile Goose, later mythologized as \nthe Goose who laid the Golden Egg. (See Goose.) \n\nAtum, the local god of Heliopolis, the biblical "City of On," \nclaimed to give birth to a primal couple from his penis by masturbat- \ning. Pyramid Texts of 2000 B.C. said "Atum created in Heliopolis by an \nact of masturbation. He took his phallus in his fist, to excite desire \nthereby. And the twins were born, Shu and Tefnut." 7 However, priests \nof Khepera insisted that their god produced Shu and Tefnut by \nmasturbation and self-fertilization through his mouth. Yet the oldest \ntraditions said Shu and Tefnut ("Dryness" and "Moisture") were \nborn of the primal Mother, Iusaset. Like the biblical God who copied \nher many centuries later, she not only created the first couple, but \nalso brought forth light as her first act of creation. 8 \n\nBefore begetting was understood, archaic myth-makers tried all \nsorts of ideas for making a male body produce offspring. A Chinese \nancestor-god, Kun, suffered a crude Caesarian section. He was slain and \ncut open so Yu, founder of the Hsia dynasty, could emerge from his \nstomach. 9 Norsemen said a first male-and-female couple were born \nfrom the sweaty armpit of the giant Ymir, who imitated Mother \nEarth in that his flesh became the soil, his blood the sea, his bones the \nmountains. 10 Ymir\'s skull became the dome of the heavens, support- \ned at four corners by four dwarves, Austri, Vestri, Nordri, and Sudri \n(East, West, North, and South), northern copies of the Sons of \nHorus. \' \' Similar cardinal-direction gods became identified with the four \nangels of the Apocalypse and four evangelists, whose totems were \nthe same. 12 Totem Symbol or \n\nThe god Loki gave birth to Odin\'s horse, after making himself embodiment of an \n\npregnant by eating a woman\'s heart. 15 The usual mythic symbol of a rationahSrif 31 \' ^ \n\nwoman\'s heart, from Egypt to northern Europe, was an apple. Thus it frequently in animal \n\nmight be assumed that in some prototypical versions of the Eden f orm; a divine or \n\nstory, Adam ate the apple before, not after, he gave birth to Eve. semi-divine mascot \n\nAdam\'s birth-giving was a syncretic product of numerous local supposed to have \n\nnotions of the male mother. A Hittite god, Kumarbi, managed to esce " e r man \n\n_ r , animal ancestor, \n\nbecome pregnant by eating his rival s penis. His offspring retused to \n\ncome out through his mouth or ears, and having no vagina he was \n\n\n\n107 \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male unable to deliver them. Finally the sea god Ea took them out through \n\nhis side, as Adam\'s God did later. The idea for Adam\'s magic birth- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ giving rib came from a Sumerian childbirth-goddess, Nin-ti, "Lady of the \nRib." Since ti meant both "rib" and "life," she was also a Lady of \nLife. She made infants\' bones in utero from their mothers\' ribs, which is \nwhy biblical writers thought ribs possessed the magic of maternity. 14 \n\nAn odd male-birth myth came from Persia\'s intensely patriarchal \nZoroastrian cult, suggesting a combination of homosexuality and \nbestiality. The primal being, the Sole-Created Bull, was castrated and \nslain. Its semen went to the moon to be purified; then from this \npurified seed two new bulls were formed. From these, "all animals \ndescended." The hidden feminine element in this phallic fantasy was \nthe moon, of course; but the two bulls must have procreated homosex- \nually. This idea was not unknown even in Christian Europe. \n"Authorities" like Paracelsus taught that a monster may be born of a \nman as a result of oral or anal intercourse with another man. 15 No \nmatter how impossible it seemed, men apparently wished to preserve at \nany price the notion that a male could give birth. \n\nChristianity demoted the Goddess to mortal status in both Eve and \nMary, whom mystics regarded as two incarnations of the same \nperson. In both incarnations she was a Mother of her Father. Gnostic \nGospels said Adam came into being from the virgin Earth, who was \nnone other than Eve. 16 The story of her birth from Adam was a late, \ndistorted version of the myth. \n\nUnless the male spirit is able as in mathematics to construct a purely \nabstract world, it must make use of the nature symbols originating in \nthe unconscious. But this brings it into contradiction with the natural \ncharacter of the symbols, which it distorts and perverts. Unnatural \nsymbols and hostility to the nature symbol e.g. Eve taken out of \nAdam are characteristic of the patriarchal spirit. But even this attempt \nat revaluation usually fails, as an analysis of this symbolism might show, \nbecause the matriarchal character of the nature symbol asserts itself \nagain and again. \' 7 \n\nThroughout the world, men\'s initiatory dramas enacted birth- \ngiving to represent even the attainment of man\'s estate. Apparently men \ncould think of no better way to adopt new members into their \nfraternities than to make the novices symbolically dead and reborn, \noften from a male mother. In New Guinea, initiates into the men\'s \ngroup crawled out from between the legs of men costumed as the birth \nspirit. 18 Australian men opened their veins to bathe a young initiate \ninto their blood, magically imitating the blood of the womb. 19 \n\nBaptismal rebirth from male blood was an idea shared by all \nmystery cults of the early Christian era. In the Mithraic Mysteries, an \ninitiate was showered with the blood of the sacrificial bull and pro- \nnounced "reborn for eternity." 20 Afterward he was fed on milk, like \nan infant. 21 From primitive times to the present, men\'s groups devised \ntheatrical imitations of birth, often claiming the rites were stolen from \n\n\n\n108 \n\n\n\nwomen or that women were murdered for them and have sought to Bitch \n\nprotect these masquerades with all the taboos their priesthoods could \n\ninvent. 22 In Malekula, men even applied the name of mara to the place ^^^^__ ^_ \nwhere male initiations were held; it meant the women\'s obstetrical ^^^^^^ \n\nenclosure or birth-temple. 23 \n\nIn its determined exclusion of women, early Christianity evolved \nsome "birth rites" of a somewhat homosexual cast. Some writers \nclaimed Christian men could "impregnate" each other, in the spiritual \nsense, by kissing: "For it is by a kiss that the perfect conceive and give \nbirth." 24 But it was hard for men to see themselves as perfect, when \nthey conspicuously lacked the ability to bring forth and nurture new \nmembers of their race. Thus their endless quest for superiority nearly \nalways required some travesty of motherhood. \n\nSymbolic motherhood represented authority in the medieval \nRussian Orthodox wedding ceremony. The bridegroom threw the \nlap of his gown over his bride, signifying adoption by the ancient rite of \nmock birth. The wearer of the gown was "mother"; the one emerg- \ning from under it was "child." The Christian idea was to show that a \nhusband exercised over his wife the authority of a mother over her \nchild.

The Bitch-goddess of antiquity was \nknown in all Indo-European cultures, beginning with the Great Bitch \nSarama who led the Vedic dogs of death. The Old English word for \na hunting dog, bawd, also became a naughty word because it applied to \nthe divine Huntress\'s promiscuous priestesses as well as her dogs. 1 \n\nHarlots and "bitches" were identified in the ancient Roman cult of \nthe Goddess Lupa, the Wolf Bitch, whose priestesses the lupae gave \ntheir name to prostitutes in general. 2 Earthly representatives of the Wolf \nBitch ruled the Roman town of Ira Flavia in Spain, as a queen or \nseries of queens named Lupa. 3 \n\nIn Christian terms, "son of a bitch" was considered insulting not \nbecause it meant a dog, but because it meant a devil that is, a \nspiritual son of the pagan Goddess. \n\n1.

According to Tacitus, the Celts "deemed it \nindeed a duty to cover their altars with the blood of captives." 2 The \nRomans did the same in essence, though their altars were "blessed" with \nthe blood of sacrificial animals. \n\nCatholics now bless altars by sprinkling them with salt, an ancient \ncustom of the Jews, based on the primitive idea that blood and salt \nwere magical equivalents because they tasted alike. Egyptian altars were \ndedicated with salt. In Egypt, dedi was the magic salt that made Nile \nwater become "as human blood." 3 (See Menstrual Blood; Salt.) \n\nBlessing a person by drawing a cross on his head and breast \noriginated with the Mithraic rite of the Taurobolium, when the cross \n(an emblem of Mithra) was marked thus on participants with the bull\'s \nblood, so they became official witnesses of the ceremony of rebirth. \n\n\n\n110 \n\n\n\nTo be blessed meant to be saved, through the magic of blood, as the \nChristian Gospels also admitted: "Almost all things are by the law \npurged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission" \n(Hebrews 9:22). \n\nl.M.

Vishnu \nsaid the blood of his boar incarnation had the creative power that only \nthe Mother\'s blood formerly had: "Gods and creatures arise out of \nthe sacrifice, for the sacrifice is their appointed food. Everything will \nalways arise from the sacrifice; this whole universe is made of the \nsacrifice." Vishnu dared to copulate with the Earth Goddess while she \nwas menstruating, and begot three boar-sons who were also sacrificed \nby "gods saying Om," the Word of creation. 1 \n\nVishnu the Boar represented an early attempt to re-assign to a \nmale the holy creative blood of life, the Goddess\'s menstruum. As the \nphallic god who gave his life for humanity, he was worshipped in \nconjunction with the Goddess by Germanic Aryans who, Tacitus \nsaid, "worship the mother of the gods, and wear as a religious symbol \nthe device of a wild boar." 2 \n\nThis Germanic boar-god became the doomsday-averting Savior \nand Lord of Death, in both human and porcine form, "born in the \ndays of old . . . of the race of gods." He was identified with Heimdall, \nborn of the Earth-and-Sea mother, fathered by boar blood. "He was \nmade strong with the force of the earth, with the cold sea and the blood \nof the sacrificial boar." 3 That is, like most gods, in dying he begot \nhimself again. \n\nThe boar-god was sacrificed especially at Yul (Yule), with an apple \nin his mouth, symbolizing his regenerated heart-soul, according to \nthe Scandinavian belief that apples were resurrection charms. 4 Hence \nthe traditional Yule pig roasted with an apple in its mouth. There was \na mystical meaning behind the pork-eating ritual. "Valhalla\'s boar" was \ncooked in a cauldron, the regenerative womb-symbol, and the skalds \nsaid of it, "It\'s prime of pork, but few men know on what Valhalla\'s \nchampions feed." 5 If one may hazard a guess, Valhalla\'s champions \nused to feed on human flesh, for which the boar was substituted. \nSwedish priests in boar masks were regarded as incarnations of Frey, \nand husbands of Freya, indicating an identification with the sacrificial \ngod who once wedded the Mother and died as both a boar and a \nman. 6 \n\nThe Jews\' taboo on pig\'s flesh was nothing so hygienic or rational \nas fear of trichinosis, as some modern apologists have tried to suggest, \nshowing gross misunderstanding of the biblical mentality. Reinach said, \n"In the whole of the Bible there is not a single instance of an epi- \ndemic or a malady attributed to the eating of unclean meats. ... To the \nBiblical writers, as to contemporary savages, illness is supernatural; it \nis an effect of the wrath of spirits. The pious Jew abstains from pork \nbecause his remote ancestors, five or six thousand years before our \nera, had the wild boar as their totem." 7 \n\nLike their neighbors, the Jews worshipped sacrificial boar-gods: \n\n\n\n112 \n\n\n\nSyrian Adonis, for one. Boars were offered to Astarte in Syria, and to Bogey \n\nher counterpart Demeter in Greece. Demeter\'s Eleusinian Mysteries \n\nmythologized the boar sacrifice as "pigs falling into a crevice in the ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nearth" at the moment when Pluto, Lord of Death, seized his virgin \n\nbride Kore. 8 The custom of driving sacrificial pigs into pits, as in the \n\nrites of Demeter and Astarte, appeared in Christian Gospels as the \n\nmiracle-tale of the Gadarene swine, whose sacrificial death impelled \n\nby "demons" was re-assigned to the intervention of Jesus (Mark \n\n5:11-13). \n\nMyths of dying gods like Tammuz, Attis, and Adonis featured the \nboar, or boarskin-clad priest, who sacrificed the god in swine form. \nSuch gods were "gored in the groin" by the boar, an allegory of ritual \ncastration. 9 As lovers of the Goddess, they were chosen from mem- \nbers of her priesthood. The sacrificer of Adonis was another of the \nGoddess\'s lovers, Ares, wearer of the boarskin. The sacrificer and \ncastrater of Attis was his divine alter ego, a boar sent by Zeus, or by the \nking of Phrygia these presumed simultaneously incarnate in the \nsame body. 10 Like Christ, Attis was the dying Son later resurrected as \nthe Father who decreed his death in the first place. Similarly, Vishnu \nthe Boar decreed death for his boar-sons. 11 Some myths said Attis died \nin the same way as Adonis, being gored by a boar. Others said Attis \nhimself was the boar, a totemic sign of his kingship. 12 \n\nMalekula presents an original primitive view of the sacrificial \nanimal as savior or surrogate for men. Mother Death guards the gates \nof the after-world. A man must pass these gates by distracting her \nattention with his sacrificial pig. While she devours the pig, he slips \nby her. 13 After sacrificing and eating on earth the savior-pig who \nbecomes part of himself, the man says, "It is no longer I who live, but \nmy sacrifice who lives in me." H Christians similarly ate their god in \ncommunion, and were taught to recite at the gate of heaven, "No \n\nmore I, but Christ." \nThe old cults of the boar were not altogether forgotten. Medieval \nfairy tales abound in magic boars, often figuring as sacrificial animals. \nThe first French book printed on the subject of witchcraft, de Spina\'s \nFortress of the Faith, declared that French witches assembled at a \ncertain sacred rock to worship the devil in the shape of a boar. 15 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty, 196-97. 2.

Like other Manicheans, they held that \nthe God who created this world of matter was a demon. 1 \n\nThe Bogomils were highly puritanical but less sexist than the \nRoman church. They admitted women to religious offices on an \nequal basis with men. The Catholic writer Cosmas condemned as \n"deviltry" their custom of appointing women to hear confessions and \ngive absolution to men. 2 Up to the late 14th century, Bogomilism was \n"the most powerful sectarian movement in the history of the Bal- \nkans," but Catholic crusades drove many members of the sect into the \narms of Islam, and the movement was crushed.

Spinka, p. 66. \n\n\n\nBones \n\nMany religions tabooed breaking the bones of a sacrificial animal, on \nthe theory that the gods needed a complete skeleton to resurrect it \nanew. 1 On one occasion, the god Thor killed and resurrected two \ngoats, but the thighbone of one had been damaged, so the new goat was \nlame. 2 \n\nThe same belief is evident in the Bible. Concerning the paschal \nlamb, God ordered: "Neither shall ye break a bone thereof" (Exodus \n12:46); "They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break \nany bone of it" (Numbers 9:12); "He keepeth all his bones; not one of \nthem is broken" (Psalms 34:20). To fulfill all these alleged prophe- \ncies, Jesus\'s bones were left intact to identify him with the Lamb: "That \n\n\n\n114 \n\n\n\nthe scripture should be fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken" \n(John 19:36). \n\nSeveral saints\' legends also made use of regenerative bones. \nSt. Germain resurrected a calf, on whose flesh he had just feasted, by \nlaying the bones on the hide and praying over them. 3 A derivative\' \nmedieval belief was that every body contains an incorruptible seed-bone, \n"out of which, as they say, as a plant out of the seed, our animal \nbodies shall in the resurrection of the dead spring up." 4 \n\nl.Lnrvusse, 307. 2. Silberer, 82. 3. de Voragine, 398. 4. Agrippa, 88. \n\n\n\nBrahma \n\n\n\nBrahma \n\nIndia\'s patriarchal god, whose priests tried to establish wholly male- \ndominated society and eliminate the Mother Goddess who, \nnevertheless, remained the parent of Brahma as she was of the other \ngods. Though some of Brahma\'s scriptures tried to dissociate him from \nthe Mother by calling him "the Birthless," yet the same scriptures \nincongruously referred to him as the Goddess\'s "Firstborn." 1 \n\nThe older dharma (holy law) said the worst of crimes was killing a \nwoman or female child, because it meant killing unborn generations. 2 \nHowever, like most patriarchal systems, Brahmanism lifted the taboo on \nmale aggression against females, and claimed that it was better to kill \nwomen than to insult Brahmans: "To revile and calumniate a worship- \nper of the Supreme Brahman is a sin ten million times worse than \nthat of killing a woman." 3 \n\nLike the medieval Christian church, Brahman priests made rules \nfor rigid control of wives, and made their deity say any other kind of \nmarriage was a sin that made the wife a whore and the children \nillegitimate, disqualified for religious observances. 4 \n\nBrahman marriage reversed the old system of matrilineal inheri- \ntance, insisting that property must pass from father to son. A widow \nwithout male children was entitled to inherit only if she "lives under the \ncontrol of the relations of her husband, and in their absence under \nthe control of her father\'s relations" that is, male relations "then \nonly is she entitled to inherit. The woman who is even likely to go \nastray is not entitled to inherit the husband\'s property." 5 In practice of \ncourse, any or all of these male groups could easily declare the widow \nunfit to inherit and divide the property among themselves. \n\nBrahmanism was essentially paternal ancestor-worship, possibly the \nroot of similar paternal ancestor-worship instituted in Israel by the \nlegendary Abraham, whose name meant "Father Brahm." There was \nthe same obsession with record-keeping. At every Brahman wedding, \nlong lists of paternal ancestors were recited, like the biblical lists of \n"begats." Brahman sons were taught to recite: "My father is my \nhighest Dharma My father is my Heaven. On my father being \n\n\n\n115 \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\n\n\nsatisfied, the whole Universe is satisfied." Brahma also displayed the \npatriarchal god\'s usual insistence on exclusivity: "Those who are averse \nto My doctrine are unbelievers and sinners, as great as those who slay \na Brahman." 6 \n\nIt is clear that Jewish patriarchy owed a debt to Brahman prece- \ndent. From the Far East came the legend of the Golden Age of \nrighteousness, when men were free from sin, had great longevity, and \ngrew to gigantic size. 7 Comparable were the long-lived biblical \npatriarchs of the antediluvian age when there were "giants in the earth" \n(Genesis 6:4). The story of Cain and Abel was Indo-Iranian. Vedic \npoets used to beg their god to accept their sacrifices, and reject those of \nother arya (men). 8 \n\nThe legend of Jonah was prefigured by the Indian tale of Candra- \ngomin, who endangered the ship he sailed on because a rival \nmagician caused a storm and took the form of a sea beast to swallow \nhim. 9 \n\nTalmudic tradition adopted the typical Oriental belief in transmi- \ngration of souls; Adam\'s soul passed by transmigration into David, \nthan into the Messiah. 10 Brahmanic revelation seemed to be part of the \nMessianic promise also. The Katha Upanishad said Brahma is realized \nin one\'s own soul dimly, as if seen in a mirror; but in the heaven of \nBrahma he is realized clearly, "as one distinguishes light from \ndarkness." 11 The New Testament repeats the same message copied al- \nmost word for word: "For now we see through a glass (i.e., mirror) \ndarkly, but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). The Brahman \ndoctrine that a thousand years is one Day of Brahma is repeated in \nPsalms 90:4, and again in the First Book of Adam and Eve, where God \nexplains that "five days and a half for him means 5,500 years for \nmen. 12 \n\nBrahma is no longer popular in his native land. He is described as a \n"theologian\'s god, whose worship never struck vital roots in the \npopular folk soil." He was used mainly to support the caste system. \n"Today Brahma is so relatively unimportant that only one or two \ntemples in all India are reserved for his exclusive worship." 13 \n\n1.

However, some \nscholars believe the \nGlossary was compiled \nlater than his \nlifetime. \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\nTriple Goddess of the great Celtic empire of Brigantia, which \nincluded parts of Spain, France, and the British Isles. Before she was a \nsaint, she was a typical feminine trinity. Brigit ruled; her two sisters \ngoverned the arts of healing and smithcraft. Cormac\'s Glossary called \n\nher "Brigit the female sage Brigit the goddess, whom poets \n\nadored, because her protecting care over them was very great and very \nfamous." 1 \n\n\n\n116 \n\n\n\nDr. MacCulloch said Brigit "originated in a period when the Celts \nworshipped goddesses rather than gods, and when knowledge \nleechcraft, agriculture, inspiration were [sic] women\'s rather than \nmen\'s. She had a female priesthood and men were perhaps excluded \nfrom her cult, as the tabooed shrine at Kildare suggests." 2 Brigit\'s \npriestesses at Kildare kept an ever-burning sacred fire like that of the \ntemple of Vesta in Rome. They called the three personae of Brigit the \n"Three Blessed Ladies of Britain" or the "Three Mothers," and \nalways identified them with the moon. 3 \n\nThe number of Brigit\'s priestesses at Kildare was 19, representing \nthe 19-year cycle of the Celtic "Great Year." Greeks said the sun god \nof the north, whom they called Hyperborean Apollo, visited the north- \nern "temple of the moon goddess" once every 19 years, a mythic \nexpression of the coincidence of solar and lunar calendars. 4 In reality the \nperiod of coincidence was 18.61 years, which meant the smallest \nregular unit to give a"mating" of sun and moon was 56 years, two \ncycles of 19 and one of 18. This astronomical data was well known to \nthe builders of Stonehenge, who marked the span of Great Years with \nposts around their circle. 5 \n\nBrigit was older than Celtic Ireland, having come with Gaelic \nCelts from their original home in Galatia. One of her earliest shrines \nwas Brigeto in Illyricum. 6 Long before the Christian era, the Goddess \nof the Brigantes was said to be the same as Juno Regina, Queen of \nHeaven, and Tanit, the Dea Celestis (Heavenly Goddess). 7 \n\nFinding the cult of Brigit impossible to eradicate, the Catholic \nchurch rather unwisely canonized her as a saint, calling her Bridget \nor Bride. Hagiographers declared she was a nun who founded a convent \nat Kildare. But the convent was noted for its heathenish miracles and \nevidences of fertility magic. Cows never went dry; flowers and sham- \nrocks sprang up in Brigit\'s footprints; eternal spring reigned in her \nbower. Irish writers refused to reduce their Goddess to mere sainthood, \nand insisted that she was Queen of Heaven, which meant identifying \nher with Mary. She was called "Mother of my Sovereign, Mary of the \nGoidels, Queen of the South, Prophetess of Christ, Mother of \nJesus." 8 \n\nAn Irish charm against the evil eye suggested collusion between \nthe pagan and Christian heavenly-mother figures; it was "the Spell \nthe great white Mary sent to Bride the lovely fair." 9 She was also the \nmystic mother-bride of St. Patrick, supposed to have died as one of \nher sacrificial victims, and entered the underworld via her sacred grove \nat Deny Down. An old distich said, "On the hill of Down, buried in \none tomb, were Bridget and Patricius." 10 Since Patrick\'s name meant \n"father," and he was as apocryphal as other Irish saints, he may have \nbeen a new name for Brigit\'s old consort the Dagda or "father." \n\nThree churches of "St. Brigit" occupied her Triple-Goddess \nterritory of Hy Many, formerly Emania or Emain Macha, country of \nthe Moon. Baptismal fees of those churches belonged to the O\'Kelly \ntribes, descended from the Goddess\'s kelles or sacred harlots. Her \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\n\n\nJ. A.

St. Brigit\'s feast day was the first of \n\nFebruary, the first day of spring according to the pagan calendar. It \nwas called Oimelc, Imolg, or Imbulc, the day of union between God \nand Goddess. 11 \n\nThe same day was celebrated in Rome as the Lupercalia, sacred to \nVenus and to women generally. With unconscious irony, the church \ntransformed it into the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, also called \nCandlemas, which kept much of its pagan symbolism and was \nregarded as a major festival of witches. 12 \n\nLike other versions of the Celtic Goddess, Brigit was a teacher of \nthe martial arts, and a patron of warfare or briga. Her soldiers were \nbrigands, or as Christians called them, outlaws. 15 Robin Hood\'s merry \nmen were outlaws of the same kind; so were Kali\'s Thugs and the \n"Assassins" who worshipped the Arabian Moon-goddess. \n\nBrigit was canonized more than once. Besides the Irish Brigit there \nwas a St. Bridget of Sweden, foundress and supreme ruler of a double \nmonastery of both sexes, the Order of Brigantines. (See Convent.) A \nbranch of the ancient "colleges" of Brigit was a Brigantine House of \nSion established in 1420 on the bank of the Thames, where it flourished \nuntil 1589 as a center of education for ladies of noble birth. 14 \n\nI.

Burning sulfur was used \neven in medieval times to fumigate sickrooms and avert the plague. The \nuse of brimstone as an agent of purification accounts for its appear- \nance in the cauldron of Purgatory with its "fire and brimstone" to burn \naway sins. \n\nAlchemists tried to "marry Hermes and Athene" by combining \nmercury with brimstone, which they thought might create gold. \nThey never succeeded. \n\n1.

The \ntitles by which she was addressed in prayers and hymns were later mis- \nunderstood as the names of different deities, which is why the \nGoddess became "goddesses" in the west, or the Thousand-Named \nOne in the east. \n\n1 .

Graves, W.G., 39. \n\n\n\nBroomstick \n\nBroomsticks were long associated with witches because they figured \nin pagan rituals of marriage and birth, the Mysteries of Women. In \nRome the broom was a symbol of Hecate\'s priestess-midwife, who \n\n119 \n\n\n\nBroomstick swept the threshold of a house after each birth to remove evil spirits that \n\nmight harm the child. 1 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ As Hecate was also the Triple Goddess presiding over marriage, \n\nher broomstick signified sexual union. Old wedding customs included \njumping over a broomstick, possibly to represent impregnation. Gypsy \nweddings always included the same ritual, though gypsies now say they \ndon\'t know what it means. 2 Oddly enough, the same broom-jumping \nritual marked the churchless weddings of black slaves in nineteenth- \ncentury America. \n\nMedieval peasant weddings in Europe were also churchless, as a \nrule, coming under the jurisdiction of common law rather than canon \nlaw, and using the rites of the old religions rather than the new. The \nbroom was so closely identified with non-ecclesiastical marriages that \nby Renaissance times, when the church began to take over the nuptial \nrites, unions "by the broom" were declared illegitimate. English \nrustics still say "if a girl strides over a broom-handle, she will be a mother \nbefore she is a wife." A girl who gives birth to a bastard child is said to \nhave "jumped over the besom." ? \n\nAs a horse for witches to ride, the broomstick apparently signified \nTantric-type sexual unions which were primary attractions of the \nfemale-oriented witch cults. Plants genet, the broom plant, was sacred \nto witches. This may explain why the ruling family of Anjou in the \n12th century was named Plantagenet. Henry II, first Plantagenet king of \nEngland, inherited his throne by matrilineal succession through his \nmother Matilda, or Maud names commonly associated with witch- \ncraft the countess of Anjou. Genet also meant a horse or steed, the \n"royal horse" of paganism. This meaning is preserved in the word \njennet, a small horse or the female donkey, and in the names fre- \nquently taken by witches: Jenet, Janet, Jeannette, Jean, or Joan. \n\nSuch names suggested a witch-child born of a sacred marriage with \na phallic god represented by the broom. A Janet or Jenny was a \nDaughter of the Horse, and old gods like Volos, Volsi, Waelsi, or Odin \nwere called "Horse\'s Penis." 4 Riding the broomstick seems to have \ndenoted the kind of sexual position viewed as a perversion by the \nchurch, woman above, man below acting as her "horse." This sexual \nimplication is confirmed by the old witch-rhyme, "Ride a cock-horse to \nBanbury Cross (i.e., crossroads), to see a fine lady on a white horse." \nThe fine lady was Godiva, "the Goddess." Her white cock-horse \nsignifed her consort. 5 \n\nChildren rode the cock-horse as a broomstick with a horse\'s head, \ncopied from Sufi mystics who entered Spain in the early Middle \nAges. Besides their organization in groups of thirteen, like covens, and \ntheir worship of the Rabba or "Lord," later transformed into the \nwitches\' god Robin, Sufi sages rode horse-headed canes called zamal- \nzain, "gala limping horse." The dervish\'s stick-horse stood for the \nPegasus-like fairy steed that carried him to heaven and back. 6 Such \ncustoms became prevalent among the Basques, who were frequently \naccused en masse of witchcraft. \n\n120 \n\n\n\nAt times a witch\'s broomstick seems to have been nothing more \nthan a dildo, anointed with the famous "flying ointment" and used \nlor genital stimulation. 7 French witches "flew" this way: "With an \nlintment which the Devil had delivered to them they anointed a \nIvooden rod which was but small, and their palms and their whole hands \nlikewise; and so, putting this small rod between their legs, straightway \nIhey flew there where they wished to be . . . and the Devil guided \nIhem." 8 Certainly churchmen were prone to describe any kind \nIf masturbation as guided by the devil women\'s masturbation most \nlarticularly so, for nothing was more abhorrent to the patriarchal \nInind than the thought that women could experience sexual pleasure \nwathout men. \n\nWitches\' ointments often incorporated such drugs as aconite, \nleadily absorbable in an oil-based liniment through skin or mucus \nInembrane, producing symptoms like giddiness, confusion, lethargy, \nlingling sensations followed by numbness, and quite possibly the \nIllusion of flying. Thus Oldham wrote: \n\nSo witches some enchanted wand bestride, \nAnd think they through the airy regions ride. 9 \n\nBecause of their ancient association with pagan midwives and \njheir Christian counterparts the witches, broomsticks took on an accre- \nion of similar superstitions. Witches\' familiar spirits were said to be \ninable to cross running water; hence, it became "bad luck" to move a \nroom across running water. It was also "bad luck" to burn a broom, \nince it was certainly bad luck for the witch. 10 \n\n1. Dumezil, 616. 2. Trigg, 86-87. 3. Spence, 148. 4. Turville-Petre, 201. \n5. Hazlitt, 25. 6.

English "brother" stemmed from Sanskrit \nhratr, "support." In pre-Vedic India it was the duty of a brother, not a \nusband, to help support a woman and her children. Husbands came \nnd went, but the matrilineal clan remained stable. As an old proverb of \nirab women said: "A husband can be found, a son can be born, but a \nrother cannot be replaced." \' \n\nA preference for brothers over husbands may be found in many \nre-patriarchal cultures. Pagan Slavic women considered "by my \nrother" their most binding oath. In pre-Christian Norway, rune stones \nn women\'s graves were raised by their brothers, not their husbands. 2 \nindent systems of clan loyalty were similar to that of the Nairs, of \nhorn it was said that no man knew his father, but "every man looks \nn his sister\'s children as his heirs. A man\'s mother manages his \n\n\n\nBrother \n\n\n\n121 \n\n\n\nBuana \n\n\n\nfamily; and after her death his eldest sister assumes the direction." \nNames and property were bequeathed in the female line. 3 \n\nThe uterine-sibling bond was so much stronger than the marriage \nbond in ancient societies that the ultimate endearment of lovers or \nspouses was to call each other "brother" and "sister." 4 King Solomon \ncalled his bride "my sister, my spouse" (Song of Solomon 4:10) with \n"sister" in the place of honor. An Egyptian wife affectionately addresse \nher husband as "brother, husband, friend," in that order. 5 \n\nWeddings sometimes meant making bride and groom pseudo- \nsiblings in some magical way. Polynesian couples were not \nconsidered truly married until their two mothers mingled their blood, \nsignifying that the married pair were born of a double, or merged, \nwomb. 6 Often, the bride and groom mingled their own blood; this was \nthe common rite of gypsy weddings. 7 \n\nBrother-sister incest was customary in ancient ruling families, \nwhen it was felt that a king and queen should be offspring of the same \nmother, so the true line of succession would not be weakened. Egyptiai \npharaohs married their sisters as a matter of course because their \nthrones were inherited through the female line. 8 One pharaoh with onl \none son and one daughter suggested to his wife that the children \nmight marry outside the family. The queen angrily rejected the idea: \n"Dost thou wrangle with me? Even if I have no children after those \ntwo children, is it not the law to marry them one to the other?" 9 \n\nBrother-sister incest was everywhere the practice of the elder gods \nand goddesses, many of whom were twins who copulated even in \ntheir mother\'s womb. Examples are Isis and Osiris, Artemis and Apollo \nFauna and Faunus, Diana and Dianus, Zeus and Hera, Yama and \nYami, Freya and Frey. According to Norse skalds, brother-sister incest \nwas the accepted custom of the Vanir or elder deities. 10 \n\nMythological evidence tends to destroy the modern conception oi \nStone Age man protecting "his" cave with "his" mate and "their" \nchildren. If the home was a cave or anything else, it was probably \nselected, furnished, and owned by the female. If there was a male \nprotecting it, he was more likely to have been a sibling than a mate. In \nfact there were no monogamous families but only family groups, \ncentering on the women and children with impregnating males a loose \nchangeable periphery. \n\n1. Briffault 1, 405, 498, 505. 2.

The Amogha school of Buddhism practiced a severe \nmorality, a life of poverty and chastity in retirement from secular \nconcerns, and the expectation of a Savior coming to earth in the near \nfuture. 1 Buddhist sages provided prototypes of Christian miracles. \nThey were said to walk on water, to speak in tongues, and to ascend to \nheaven in the flesh. 2 Jains regarded the true Buddhist "hero" (vira) as \n"not he who is of great physical strength and prowess, the great eater \nand drinker, or man of powerful sexual energy, but he who has \ncontrolled his senses, is a truth-seeker, ever engaged in worship, and \nwho has sacrificed lust and all other passions." 3 \n\nBuddha is more properly the Buddha, since Buddha was not a \nname but a title, the "Enlightened or Blessed One," comparable to \nChristos, "the Anointed One." Buddha had many other names because \nhe had already lived through many incarnations on earth. Even the \nBuddha supposed to have appeared in the 5 th century B.C. had several \nnames: Gautama, Sakyamuni, Siddhartha the last, again, not a \nname but a title, "Rich in Yogic Power." Buddha was miraculously \nbegotten by the Lord of Hosts and born of the Virgin Maya, the \nsame Great Goddess worshipped throughout Asia and having the \nalternative Near-Eastern names of Maia, Marah, Mari, or Maria. 4 \n\nMany Buddhas who had already come and gone were bodhisattvas \nor saints, sometimes simply known as Buddhas. Any sage might \nbecome a bodhisattva through devotion to the holy life. But one true \nBuddha remained to come again to earth. He was Maitreya, the \nMaster, or the Future Buddha, similar to the being known as Kalki, the \nlast avatar of the god Vishnu who would appear with the approach of \ndoomsday. The final coming of the Savior would signal the end of the \npresent world. He would judge the righteous, and annihilate the \nwicked, and make everything ready for the ultimate creation of a new \nheaven and a new earth. 5 \n\nThese were basic ideas of Christianity as well as Buddhism: simple, \neasy to understand, dramatic, and appropriately aligned with arche- \ntypal hopes and fears. The more subtle teachings of Buddhism, like \nthose of Christianity, apparently developed out of group thinking of \nsubsequent sectaries, especially the more ascetic sort. Yet again, as in \nChristianity the ascetics were unable to blot out the rich, colorful \nsensuality of "pagan" Hinduism. Although they claimed Buddha said \nthe true sage must never see or speak to a woman, must avoid \nfeminine creatures like the plague, yet within a few centuries the \nworship of the Goddess reasserted itself and all the bodhisattvas were \nprovided with Shaktis who would welcome them to eternal sexual bliss \n\n123 \n\n\n\nBuddhism in heaven. "Tantric" Buddhism re-assimilated the feminine principle. \n\nUntil the advent of Islam, the original Buddhist asceticism was largely \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ forgotten except for a few eremitic groups. A well-known aphorism \nsaid: Buddhatvam yosidyonisamsritam, "Buddhahood resides in the \nvulva (yoni)." 6 \n\nBuddhist legends reveal the constant tension between ascetic and \nsensual elements. It was said Buddha wanted his brother Nanda to \nbecome a monk, but Nanda was too much in love with his beautiful \nmistress. So Buddha played a trick on him. He took Nanda to heaven \nand showed him the celestial nymphs, who were so desirable that Nanda \ninstantly forgot the mortal woman he had loved. Buddha then told \nhim these nymphs could be won only by a life of rigorous self-denial \nand meditation. Nanda agreed to join the monkish order. The ascetic \nlife soon purged him of all desires, and he became as celibate as Buddha \nhad wished but only because of his overwhelming lust for a tran- \nscendent sexual experience! 7 \n\nLike their western counterparts in later centuries, Buddhist monks \nself-consciously threatened the Goddess with destruction, even \nthough her virgin form had given birth to their Savior. A Buddhist \nhymn said, "This time I shall devour thee utterly, Mother Kali; for I \nwas born under an evil star and one so born becomes, they say, the \neater of his mother." 8 \n\nStories of the Buddha and his many incarnations circulated inces- \nsantly throughout the ancient world, especially since Buddhist monks \ntraveled to Egypt, Greece, and Asia Minor four centuries before Christ, \nto spread their doctrines. 9 Ascetics like the Essenes were certainly \ninfluenced by them. Christians continued to hear tales of Buddhist \norigin, and to relate them rather naively to their own beliefs. Buddha \nhimself entered the Christian canon as a saint St. Josaphat, a corrup- \ntion of Bodhisat when John of Damascus wrote down his life story \nin the 8th century a.d. 10 Buddha the Christian saint was supplied with \na companion called Barlaam, who converted the Indian prince to a \nChristian asceticism despite his royal father\'s efforts to thwart this \npurpose. 11 \n\nMany scholars have pointed out that the basic tenets of Christian- \nity were basic tenets of Buddhism first; but it is also true that the \nceremonies and trappings of both religions were more similar than \neither has wanted to acknowledge. \n\nBuddhism has much in common with Roman Catholic Christianity, \nhaving its purgatory, its Goddess of Mercy, and its elaborate machinery \nfor delivering the dead from pain and misery through the good offices of \nthe priests. Among other similarities may be mentioned celibacy, \nfasting, use of candles and flowers on the altar, incense, holy water, \nrosaries, priestly garments, worship of relics, canonization of saints, use \nof a dead language for the liturgy and ceremonials generally. The trinity of \nBuddhas, past, present, and future, is compared by some to the Father, \nSon, and Holy Ghost. The immaculate mother of Shakyamuni, whose \nname Maya is strikingly similar to that of Mary, the mother of Jesus, is \n\n124 \n\n\n\nBugger \n\n\n\nalso to be noticed, while Buddha\'s temptation on Vulture Peak by Mara \n\nthe Evil One, may also be contrasted with the similar temptation of \n\nOur Lord. . . . The worship of ancestors is in some measure akin to the \n\nsaying of masses for the dead, and at one time the Jesuits considered it a ^^^^^^"" \n\nharmless observance and tolerated it in their converts.

Bulgarian Paulicians were \nanathematized for disobeying the Roman pope, setting up their own \nchurches independent of Rome, and admitting women to clerical \noffice on an equal basis with men. 1 \n\nBosnian Patarenes were also called buggers, since they modeled \ntheir national church on that of Bulgaria. About 1200 a.d. the papacy \nlaunched "a cruel war against the Bosnian Patarenes, which lasted two \nand a half centuries, and finally culminated in the acceptance, on \ntheir part, of the Mohammedan faith and in becoming Turks, rather \nthan submit to the Roman See." 2 \n\nReligious wars led the Balkans into social chaos. Heretics were \nhunted down like animals, and tortured. Lands belonging to the \nheretic magnates (nobles) were seized and handed over to their Catholic \nenemies. The heretics for their part continued to regard themselves \nas the only true Christian nations. Under the anti-Roman Code of \nStephen, Catholic priests who tried to convert Balkan Christians back \nto "the Latin faith" were declared criminals. 3 Quarrels and conflicts \npersisted up to the present century. \n\n1. Knight, D.W.P., 176. 2. Spinka, 147. 3. Spinka, 167-68. \n\n\n\nBull \n\nThe biblical title translated "God" is El, originally the title of the \nPhoenician bull-god called Father of Men. As the "supreme god of the \nSemitic pantheon, El was worshipped throughout Syria alongside the \nlocal gods, or Ba\'als, one of his titles, indeed, being \'the Bull.\' " \' Like \nZeus the Bull, consort of Hera-Europa-Io the white Moon-Cow, El \nmarried Asherah, the Semitic sacred Cow. He was identified with Elias \nor Helios, the sun. He was still the Semitic Father of Men in the time \nof Jesus, who cried to him from the cross, calling him Father (Mark \n15:34). \n\nNearly every god of the ancient world was incarnate sooner or later \nin a bull. The Cretan moon-king called Minos inhabited a succession of \nMinotaurs (moon-bulls), who were sacrificed as the king\'s surrogates. \n\n\n\n125 \n\n\n\nBull Yama, the Hindu Lord of Death, wore a bull\'s head and became the \n\nunderworld judge, like Minos. 2 Shiva was incarnate in the white bull \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Nandi. 3 The real reason King Nebuchadnezzar "ate grass" probably \nwas that his soul temporarily entered into the body of the divine \nsacrificial bull (Daniel 4:33). Court prophets of the kings of Israel put \non bull masks to represent the king while casting spells for his victory \nover his enemies (1 Kings 22:1 1). 4 \n\nBull worship was a large part of Mithraism. The bull\'s blood was \ncredited with power to produce all creatures on earth without the aid of \nthe cow, though her power was implicit in that the bull\'s blood was \ntaken up and magically treated by the Moon. The bull was consecrated \nto Anahita, a Persian name of the Moon-goddess whom the Greeks \ncalled Artemis Tauropolos, "Bull-Slayer," of whom the bull-slaying \nsavior Mithra was a late, masculinized form. 5 Like most patriarchal \nsymbols, those of the Mithraic cult were copied from myths of the \nAsian Goddess. A statue of Kali in the Ellora caves shows her in the \npose typical of Mithra, holding up the nose of the sacrificial bull and \npreparing to slaughter it. 6 \n\nThe bull was killed for a baptism of blood at the Roman Taurobo- \nlium in honor of Attis, Cybele, or Mithra. "A trench was dug over \nwhich was erected a platform of planks with perforations and gaps. \nUpon the platform the sacrificial bull was slaughtered, whose blood \ndripped through upon the initiate in the trench ... he turned round and \nheld up his neck that the blood might trickle upon his lips, ears, eyes, \nand nostrils; he moistened his tongue with the blood, which he \nthan drank as a sacramental act. Greeted by the spectators, he came \nforth from this bloody baptism believing that he was purified from his \nsins and \'born again for eternity.\' " 7 The participant in the Taurobo- \nlium acted out literally what Christians called washing in the blood of \nthe lamb. \n\nEgypt\'s savior Osiris was worshipped in bull form as Apis-Osiris, \nthe Moon-bull of Egypt, annually slain in atonement for the sins of the \nrealm. 8 In the ceremony of his rebirth, he appeared as the Golden Calf, \nHorus, born of Isis whose image was a golden cow. The same Golden \nCalf was adored by the Israelites under Aaron (Exodus 32:4). \n\nThe Orphic god Dionysus also took the form of a bull; one of his \nearlier incarnations was the Cretan bull-god Zagreus, "the Goodly \nBull," a son and reincarnation of Zeus, and another version of the \nMinotaur. The god was a bull on earth, and a serpent in his subterra- \nnean, regenerating phase. The Orphic formula ran: "The bull is the \nfather of the serpent, and the serpent is the father of the bull." 9 \nDionysus was reincarnated over and over, and there were some who \nidentified him with the Persian Messiah. In the Book of Enoch, \nthe Messiah is represented as a white bull. 10 \n\nAthenian legends of the Moerae or Fates compared all men to \nthe sacrificial bull sentenced to death at the hands of Fate sooner or \nlater. Medieval superstition called the Fate-goddess Mora, a nocturnal \nspirit who roams the world seizing men and crushing them until they \n\n126 \n\n\n\n"roar like bulls." She was also Christianized as St. Maura, on whose Buto \n\nsacred day women were forbidden to sew, lest they "cut the thread of Byelobog \n\nlife" after the manner of the Moerae. 11 ^^^^-^_^^_^ \n\nIn medieval England, Twelfth Night games featured remnants of \nbull worship. A large cake with a hole in the center was thrown over the \nbull\'s horn, to form a lingam-yoni. The bull was then tickled, "to make \nhim toss his head." If he threw the cake behind him, it belonged to the \nmistress; if in front, it belonged to the bailiff. 12 This ceremony probably \nderived from an ancient custom of divination. Like all sacrificial victims \nalready dedicated to the supernatural realm, the bull was believed to \nhave prophetic powers. \n\n1. Larousse, 74. 2. Campbell, ML, 409. 3. Campbell, Or.M, 90. \n4.

Italian \nnobleman, philosopher \nand scholar, declared \na heretic for his \nattempts to unite \nChristian theology with \nCabalistic doctrine. \n\n\n\nCabala \n\nMedieval Jewish mystical system obviously influenced by Tantrism \nand Sufism, like the Christian courtly-love movement of the same \nperiod. The Cabala\'s basic premise was that all the world\'s ills \nstemmed from God\'s loss of contact with his female counterpart, the \nShekina, a Hebraic version of Shakti. God is fragmented, and only \nthe Shekina has power to "put God back together." \' Universal harmo- \nny must be restored by making God and his Goddess once more \n"one." 2 \n\nSexual union of mortals was thought to create its like on the plane \nof the divine. Therefore sexual intercourse was a sacramental act \nhelpful to God and the Shekina. "The efflorescence of such beliefs into \norgiastic rites suggests itself too readily not to be attempted, and in- \ndeed, in the further development of Kabbalistic doctrine, such attempts \nwere made." 5 Generally, however, the cabalist confined his erotic \nexperiments to his legal wife. The first step in his ascent of the \nSephiroth or Tree of Knowledge was the female sexual power, \nShekina-Malkuth, Queen and Bride, represented by the moon and the \nspouse. 4 Further steps made use of elaborate systems of numerology, \nmagic, and scriptural allegory, yielding successive revelations of the \ndivine nature. \n\nThe major cabalistic work was the Sefer ha-Zohar, "Book of \nSplendor," composed in the late 1 3th century by Moses de Leon of \nGuadalajara, who claimed its real author was the legendary 2nd-century \nmystic Simeon ben Yohai. He pretended to have the ancient original \nof the book in his possession, but it was never produced. Scholars have \nconcluded that it never existed, and de Leon wrote the Sefer ha- \nZohar himself. 5 \n\nDespite its Jewish orientation, the Cabala exerted a strong appeal \nfor contemporary Christian mystics. It has been much in the favor of \noccultists ever since. Pico della Mirandola even professed to find in the \nCabala what the Jews themselves denied: the incarnation of full \ngodhood in Jesus. He wrote: "No science offers greater assurance of \nChrist\'s divinity than magic and the Cabala." 6 See Hexagram; \nShekina. \n\nl.Lederer, 186. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Cabala." 3. Lederer, 188. 4.

Her consort was the Young God, variously known as \nDionysus, Ganymede, or Cabirius. In Thebes the Great Goddess \n\n\n\n130 \n\n\n\nwas called Demeter Cabiria, sometimes a trinity of "three Cabirian Caduceus \n\nnymphs." Her sexual union with the god was represented by the Caillech \n\nsame symbol as in India and Egypt: water poured from a male vessel ^^^^^^^^^-i \n\ninto a female one. 1 (See Jar-bearer.) Because of its ancient erotic \nconnotations, Cabiria became a common witch-name in medieval \ntimes. \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 324-25. \n\n\n\nCaduceus \n\nSome Gnostic Christians worshipped the serpent hung on a cross, \nrod, or Tree of Life, calling it Christ the Savior, also a title of Hermes \nthe Wise Serpent represented by his own holy caduceus, the scepter \nof two serpents. This was one of the oldest and most revered holy \nsymbols. "The usual mythological association of the serpent is not, as \nin the Bible, with corruption, but with physical and spiritual health, as in \nthe Greek caduceus." To Sumerians it was an emblem of life, \nappearing on art works like the Libation Cup of Gudea, ca. 2000 b.c. In \npre-Hellenic Greece the caduceus was displayed on healing temples \nlike those of Asclepius, Hygeia, and Panacea, which is why it is still an \ninternational symbol of the medical profession. The caduceus is \nfound also in Aztec sacred art, enthroned like a serpent-deity on an \naltar. North American Indians knew it too. A Navaho medicine man \nsaid his people\'s sacred cave once featured "a stone carving of two \nsnakes intertwined, the heads facing east and west." \' \n\nHindu symbolism equated the caduceus with the central spirit of \nthe human body, the spinal column, with two mystic serpents twined \naround it like the genetic double helix: ida-nadiio the left, pingala-nadi \nto the right. 2 \n\nMoses\'s brazen serpent on a pole, the mere sight of which cured \nthe Israelites, was probably a prophylactic caduceus (Numbers 21:9). \nIt was named Nehushtan, and worshipped in the tabernacle up to the \nreign of Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4). See Hermes. \n\n1. Campbell, M. I., 282-84, 286-88, 294-95. 2. Bardo Thodol, 215. \n\n\n\nCaillech \n\nOld Celtic name for Kali-the-Crone, the Great Goddess in her \nDestroyer aspect. Like Kali, the Caillech was a black Mother who \nfounded many races of people and outlived many husbands. She was \nalso a creatress. She made the world, building mountain ranges of stones \nthat dropped from her apron. 1 \n\nScotland was once called Caledonia: the land given by Kali, or \n\n\n\n131 \n\n\n\nCain Cale, or the Caillech. "Scotland" came from Scotia, the same \n\nGoddess, known to Romans as a "dark Aphrodite"; to Celts as Scatha or \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m Scyth; and to Scandinavians as Skadi. 2 \n\nLike the Hindus\' destroying Kalika, the Caillech was known as a \nspirit of disease. One manifestation of her was a famous idol of carved \nand painted wood, kept by an old family in County Cork, and described \nas the Goddess of Smallpox. As diseased persons in India sacrificed to \nthe appropriate incarnation of the Kalika, so in Ireland those afflicted by \nsmallpox sacrificed sheep to this image. 3 It can hardly be doubted that \nKalika and Caillech were the same word. \n\nAccording to various interpretations, caillech meant either an old \nwoman, or a hag, or a nun, or a \'Veiled one." 4 This last apparently \nreferred to the Goddess\'s most mysterious manifestation as the future, \nFate, and Death ever veiled from the sight of men, since no man \ncould know the manner of his own death. \n\nIn medieval legend the Caillech became the Black Queen who \nruled a western paradise in the Indies, where men were used in \nAmazonian fashion for breeding purposes only, then slain. Spaniards \ncalled her Califia, whose territory was rich in gold, silver, and gems. \nSpanish explorers later gave her name to their newly discovered paradise \non the Pacific shore of North America, which is how the state of \nCalifornia came to be named after Kali. \n\nIn the present century, Irish and Scottish descendants of the Celtic \n"creatress" still use the word caillech as a synonym for "old \nwoman." 5 \n\nl.Rees,41. 2.

The Bible says Cain\'s murder \nof his brother Abel was caused by jealousy, after God accepted Abel\'s \nblood sacrifice but rejected Cain\'s offering of vegetable firstfruits. \nFearing to depart from this precedent, the Jews offered blood \nsacrifices to Yahweh up to the early Christian era. \n\nThe Bible story was a Hebraic repetition of the Persian myth of \nAhriman and Ahura Mazda, who offered sacrifices to an elder deity, \nVayu. Ahriman was declared a traitor and devil when his offering was \nrefused. 1 Indo-Iranian priests used to pray the gods to accept their \nown sacrifices, and refuse those of other arya (men). 2 Ahriman was the \nancestor of those other arya, since his original Hindu name was \nAryaman, father of men. \n\nThe myth of Cain was based on primitive sacrificial magic, as \nshown by certain internal inconsistencies. God placed a curse on \n\n\n\n132 \n\n\n\nCain, at the same time protecting him with a mark of immunity. Hooke \nexplains part of the ritual fertility sacrifice: \n\nThe sacrificer is defiled by his act. ...It is this which explains why the \nslayer enjoys ritual protection . . . the most likely explanation of the \nmark is that it represents a tattoo mark or other indication that the fugitive \nbelonged to a sacred class. We have evidence from Hebrew sources \nthat the prophets bore such marks. . . . Tammuz, who bears the title of \n"the Shepherd, " dies, or is ritually slain, during the period of summer \ndrought . . . and his official slayer was obliged to flee in order to remove \nthe ceremonial guilt of the slaying from the community. 3 \n\nSuch comparisons are needed to solve the dilemma of those \ntheologians who, through the centuries, have been helpless to explain \nGod\'s apparent blunder in protecting Cain from nonexistent ene- \nmies, when there were as yet no people in the world but Cain and his \nparents. Actually, the sacred caste of Cainite smiths worshipped the \nGoddess and dedicated sacrifices of the Good Shepherd to her as the \nEarth, who "opened her mouth" for Abel\'s blood (Genesis 4:1 1). \nCain\'s myth reflects the patriarchs\' hostility toward this caste. 4 Eventual- \nly, they drove all the smiths out of their country, and had to send their \ntools to the Philistines for repair because "there was no smith found \nthroughout all the land of Israel" (1 Samuel 13:19). Before the ban \non smithcraft, however, they had the famous Tubal-cain, "instructor of \nevery artificer in brass and iron" (Genesis 4:22). The fraternity of \nsmiths was of Midianite origin, and may have inflicted a certain leg \ninjury upon initiates, which could have been the mark of Cain. The \nHebrew word for Passover, Pesach, meant "to dance with a limp." 5 \nThe festival of Pesach was associated with the Midianites or Kenites \n(Cainites, "children of Cain"), who were famed as miners and smiths, \nand worshipped the Great Mother in the copper mines of Sinai. \n\nAccording to the Sinai tablets, Semitic metalworkers called their \ndeity Elath-Yahu, a combination of Yahweh and El-Lat or Allatu, Lady \nof the Underworld; but she was also identified with celestial Hathor. 6 \nThe Cainites migrated from northern Syria, where their smith god \nformerly occupied the volcanic mountain Jebel-Al-Aqra, a seat of Baal \nin the Ras Shamra texts. 7 The Mosaic Yahweh was a volcano-god \nlike this Midianite Baal, or like limping Hephaestus and Latin Vulcanus, \ngods represented by "a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by \nnight" (Exodus 13:21-22). \n\nExodus 2:16 says Moses was adopted by the Midianite smiths \nthrough his marriage to their priestess, one of the usual sacred \nnumber of seven sisters. Prominent in the clan were such artisans as \nBezaleel, maker of the ark of the covenant, who was filled "with the \nspirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all \nmanner of workmanship; and to devise curious works, to work in \ngold, and in silver, and in brass" (Exodus 35:31-32). The word here \n\n\n\nCain \n\n\n\n133 \n\n\n\nCallisto translated "God"apparently meant the spirit of Elath-Yahu. But \n\nCandlemas Moses quarreled with his Midianite wife, apparently over his attempt to \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ institute the Egyptian custom of circumcision (Exodus 4:25) and \nthey were divorced (Exodus 18:2). Subsequently, smithcraft dis- \nappeared from Israel after a long-remembered feud that imputed the \ncrime of fratricide to Moses\'s followers, though their priestly tradition \nwas to lay it on Cain. The account in Exodus 32 shows that the \nvictims were not shepherds, but Cainites: \n\nMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord\'s side? \nlet him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves \ntogether unto him. And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of \nIsrael, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate \nto gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every \nman his companion, and every man his neighbor. And the children of \nLevi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that \nday about three thousand men. (Exodus 32:26-28) \n\nIn later ages, Cain became a demi-devil, in the view of religious \n\nauthorities who failed to notice that the true brother-slayers were Moses\'s \n\nfollowers. Or, if they did notice, they regarded the killing of three \n\nthousand as less important than the killing of one. In folklore, Cain \n\nremained attached to the diabolized matriarchal tradition: he was the \n\nman in the moon. 8 A German tale said the man in the moon refused to \n\nkeep God\'s sabbath, the Sun-day. Therefore he was sent to the moon, \n\nand a saint informed him: "As you value not Sunday on earth, yours \n\nshall be a perpetual Moon-day in heaven." 9 \n\nl.Larousx, 323. 2. Dume/il.425. 3.

Calliste was an old name for Artemis\'s sacred \nisland Thera (She-Beast). Hellenic writers said the Attic rites of \nArtemis involved young girls dressed as the She-bear, which gave rise to \nthe myth of Callisto, a nymph who lost her virginity to Zeus and gave \nbirth to the bear-child. They were placed in heaven as Ursa Major and \nUrsa Minor. 1 Of course the nymph was the virgin aspect of the \nGoddess herself. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1, 86; W.G, 185. \n\nCandlemas \n\nBecause it fell forty days after Christmas, Candlemas became the \nFestival of the Purification of the Virgin according to the Judeo- \nChristian rule that women must be "purified" forty days after \n\n\n\n134 \n\n\n\nchildbirth, an event which the patriarchs claimed rendered a mother Cannibalism \n\nritually unclean. The Bible specifies forty days of impurity following \n\nthe birth of a son, and eighty days following the birth of a daughter, ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsince females were supposed to be twice as unclean as males \n\n(Leviticus 12:2-5). The Christian God also considered new mothers \n\nunclean, and would not allow a woman to enter a church until the \n\nproper time had elapsed after her delivery. Her ritual purification was \n\nknown as "churching." \n\nThe Council of Trullus once tried to abolish the festival of \nCandlemas, on the ground that in giving birth to Christ, the Virgin \n"suffered no pollution, and therefore needed no purification." \n\nBut Candlemas was not originally a Christian festival. To Roman \npagans, it was the day honoring Juno Februata as the virgin mother \nof Mars. Like the Lupercalia two weeks later, the day commemorated \nthe Goddess who engendered the "fever" (febris) of love. 1 Christian \nauthorities said the pagan people went about Rome with "candles \nburning in worship of this woman Februa." Pope Sergius renamed \nthe holy day "to undo this foul use and custom, and turn it onto God\'s \nworship and our Lady\'s ... so that now this feast is solemnly hal- \nlowed through all Christendom." 2 Still, Candlemas was properly \nconsidered sacred to women and to the Goddess of Love. 5 Among \nCeltic pagans it was the Feast of Imbolg, which stood opposite the great \nfestival of Lammas in the old sacred year. \n\nOmens were taken on Candlemas Day for the new growing \nseason, especially its weather. Therefore animals were said to come \nout of hibernation to provide helpful predictions for the end of winter; \nwhich is why it is now Groundhog Day. An old rhyme said, "If \nCandlemas Day be fair and bright, Winter will have another flight; If \nCandlemas Day be shower and rain, Winter is gone and will not \ncome again." 4 \n\nl.deVoragine, 151. 2.

Hazlitt, 87. \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\nThe most consistently observed taboo in civilized society is the taboo \nagainst eating human flesh, though there is no comparable taboo against \nkilling, which is done regularly, sometimes in enormous volume, as in \nthe case of war. \n\nUpon finding human sacrifice but not cannibalism among the \nPolynesians, Captain Cook called it a shocking waste of the human \nrace, and wrote: "It were much to be wished, that this deluded people \nmay learn to entertain the same horror of murdering their fellow- \ncreatures ... as they now have of feeding, corporeally, on human flesh \nthemselves." 1 Of course the good captain failed to notice that the \nsame delusion dwelt among his own countrymen. Eventually the \n\n\n\n135 \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\n\n\nMethodius 9th-cen- \ntury Greek missionary \nto the Slavs, canon- \nized soon after his death \nby the Greek church, \nand a thousand years \nlater by the Roman. \n\n\n\nChristians taught the Polynesians not to murder their fellow-creatures \nany more, by the simple expedient of murdering large numbers of \nPolynesians until they gave up. \n\nWestern morality has always allowed and encouraged mass killing, \nprovided the dead never became meals for the living. It has been \nnoted that the decline of human sacrifice and cannibalism in antiquity \nwas not accompanied by a decline in human slaughter generally. On \nthe contrary, the scale of warfare steadily increased with the growth of \ncivilization, up to the point where the highly technical civilizations of \ntoday stand ready to exterminate an entire world. Moreover the highest \ncasualty lists have been accumulated in precisely the same nations \nthat call themselves Christian. 2 \n\nChurches, declaring themselves officially opposed to killing, have \nalways managed to justify it nonetheless, when it seemed expedient. \nEven more curious a contradiction may be found on the matter of \ncannibalism, which Christian authorities regarded with the utmost \nhorror. Witches were accused of this crime more than any other, since it \nseemed dreadful enough to deserve the merciless punishment its \nalleged practitioners received. Yet at the very core of Christian faith lay \nthe sacrament upon which salvation, redemption, eternal life and all \nthe rest depended completely: a sacrament of cannibalism, not "sym- \nbolic" but according to its theological rationale, absolutely real. \n\nGod-eating was a universal custom descended from the earliest \nbeginnings of civilization, when it was usually a genuine cannibal \nfeast. As the incarnate god, "the victim is not only slain, but the \nworshippers partake of the body and blood of the victim, so that his \nlife passes into their life, and knits them to the deity in living \ncommunion." 3 \n\nThe object was to become flesh of the god\'s flesh by eating him, so \nas to share in the resurrection of the divine flesh. There is no use \npretending that this "Christian" ceremony did not originate in ceremo- \nnies of real cannibalism as primitive sympathetic magic. All the \nmystery-religions of the early Christian era centered on a pseudo- \ncannibalistic sacrament believed to identify the worshipper with the \nworshipped. "That there was a firm belief in the earlier stages of \nreligion, of such participation in the god by eating him in a sacramen- \ntal meal cannot be questioned. In the Thracian-Dionysiac Mysteries, \ne.g., the celebrants by such a meal obtain a share in the divine life of \nthe god, and so are called by his name." 4 \n\nThe same idea underlay Christian sacraments as well as those of \nthe other Mysteries. Cyril of Jerusalem talked of "partaking of the \nbody and blood of Christ, that you may become con-corporate and con- \nsanguineous with Him; for thus we become Christophori, his body \nand his blood entering into our members." Methodius taught that \n"every believer must through participation in Christ be born a \nChrist. ... He was made man that we might be made God." The same \nsacrament in other religions, however, was a diabolic rite: "Evil spirits \n\n\n\n136 \n\n\n\ngain power by means of the food consecrated to them, and are \nintroduced by your own hands into your own bodies; there they hide \nthemselves for a long time and unite with the soul." 5 \n\nTrue cannibalism was still overtly associated with Tibetan sacrifices \nup to the 7th century a.d., after which the sacred mystery play \nprovided symbolic substitutes. A victim made of dough was torn apart, \nhis "entrails" distributed and devoured. Sometimes, real flesh from \nthe corpse of an executed criminal was inserted into the dough image. \nAt the atonement festival, a bull-masked priest called the Holy King \nof Religion stabbed the sacrificial figure, cut off its limbs, opened the \nbreast and extracted artificial lungs, heart, and intestines. The re- \nmains were scattered by animal-masked dancers, as the remains of Osiris \nand other savior-gods of antiquity were scattered over the earth. 6 \n\nSuch dancers recall the Sabeans (Shebans) of Ezekiel 24, called \n"women that shed blood," who dressed in golden crowns and brace- \nlets to make mourning for the dead, and "ate the bread of men." Similar \nfunerary dancers were the Egyptian muu or "mothers," who wore \nvulture feathers to impersonate the Goddess Mut, or Nekhbet, eater of \nthe dead. \n\nRecently in parts of France it was a custom to make a dough man \nof the last sheaves of the harvest to represent the human sacrifice. He \nwas broken in pieces by the make (an old title of a clan mother) and \ngiven to the people to eat. Similarly in Mexico, after human sacrifices \nwere discontinued, a flint-tipped dart was hurled into the breast of a \ndough man. This was known as "killing the god so that his body \nmight be eaten." In a ceremony called torqualo, "God is eaten," the \nimage was divided into small pieces and distributed among the \npeople. 7 \n\nThis was an obvious survival of Aztec religious ideas. The victim \nimpersonating the god received worship, healed the sick, and blessed \nthe people, always attended by his keeper-apostles. Then he was killed \nand butchered in special houses called calpulli, which distributed him. \nNursing mothers would smear their nipples with a victim\'s holy blood so \neven their infants could partake of it. \n\nThe Greek omophagia was originally a cannibal orgy that even \ndispensed with cooking. Victims were torn apart with the teeth and \nbare hands of the participants and eaten raw. Greek classical writers \npreferred to forget the omophagia. They looked down on barbarian \ntribes for sexual promiscuity and cannibalizing their family members. 10 \n\nWhat was the relationship between eating sacred kings and saviors \nand eating family members? The answers have been given by canni- \nbals themselves: women eat the flesh of dead men and bring them back \nto life as new children. Primitive people reasoned that, in order to be \nborn again, one must get inside a woman\'s body. The simplest way to \naccomplish this was to be eaten by her. This was the original root of \nthe world-wide doctrine of reincarnation: literally, re-clothing in flesh. \n\nBefore discovery of the mechanism of conception, a dying man \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\n\n\nThe original "barbe- \ncue" was a cannibal \nfeast. The word \ncame from barbricot, \nthe grill of green \nboughs on which Carib \nIndians used to roast \nhuman flesh. 8 \nAncient writings often \nspeak of the canni- \nbalistic habits of elder \nraces. The Norse el- \nder gods or giants were \njotunn, from an \nIndo-European root \nword meaning "eat- \ners." They were \nbelieved to eat men, \nlike jack\'s giant who \ndrank the blood of \nEnglishmen and made \nbread of their bones. 9 \n\n\n\nH7 \n\n\n\nCannibalism looked forward to rebirth from one of the tribal mothers who would \n\nconvert his flesh and blood into a new baby. Thus the Massagetae \n_____ __________ considered being eaten by clan mothers the only honorable death. A \n\nman could become flesh of their flesh, and live again. 11 Resurrection \nwas brought about by the mysterious magic of women who, like the \nearth, gave life over and over. \n\nAustralian native women have been known to eat their infants who \ndie, then to paint the bones red and hang them about their bodies: \ncrude magic aimed at returning the child to the matrix and re-coating its \nbones with life-giving maternal blood. Women of the Bibinga tribe \nstated quite plainly that they ate the dead to give them reincarnation. 12 \nIn New Guinea, a newborn child would receive the soul-name of a \nman who was killed and his flesh given to the mother to eat. 13 \n\nIn 1852, Dr. Hubsch wrote of the African tribe called Niam- \nNiam: "As soon as one of the tribe dies, his relations, instead of \nburying him, cut him up and regale themselves upon his remains; \nconsequently there are no cemeteries in this land." H Baganda \ntribesmen said their women sometimes became so hungry that they bit \noff their babies\' ears probably a euphemistic way of saying they ate \nthe whole baby, confident of their ability to give it another birth. 15 \n\nThe notion that pregnancy is the result of eating is still widespread \namong savages. Words for consuming and conceiving are often the \nsame. There was an ancient Babylonian proverb: "Who grows pregnant \nwithout having conceived? Who grows fat without having eaten?" 16 \nAccording to Horace, the real primal scene was not the sexual drama \npostulated by Freud, but "A child, by a fell witch devoured, dragged \nfrom her entrails, and to life restored." 17 The Bible\'s term for birth is \n"coming forth from the bowels" (Genesis 1 5:4), for, like children, the \nancients were not altogether certain of the distinction between repro- \nductive and digestive systems. The Sanhedrin said a woman may \nconceive by drinking or bathing in water used to wash a corpse, an \nobvious survival of the primitive idea of a dead soul entering a new \nmother. 18 \n\nThe Chinese in the Shang period thought birth and rebirth were \nthe same thing. The pictogram kuei, meaning both "soul" and \n"rebirth," was a fetus. 19 \n\nThe Yanomamo say they used to practice cannibalism, because \ntheir mother goddess Mamokoriyoma allowed them to eat dead \nparents and children. But they ceased to worship her, and declared \ncannibalism a sin. Cremation of the dead was instituted. Yet they still \neat the ashes of the dead, mixed with food. Sharing the ashes of \nimportant ancestors is a sacred ceremony thought to strengthen \nkinship bonds. 20 \n\nIn southeastern Africa, when a woman marries into another \nkinship group, she must eat kernels of grain raised on the skull of a \ndead ancestor. When she gives birth, elders watch for signs of similarity \nbetween the deceased and the new baby. Kernels of grain were \nsimilarly grown on the mummy of Osiris and the body of Adonis, who \n\n138 \n\n\n\nwas born in Bethlehem, the "House of Bread." The grain was eaten \nin solemn communion by the god\'s worshippers, who took it to mean \nthey were like him, and would be reborn like him. Hawaiians had a \ngod like Osiris, who was dismembered and buried in many earth- \nwombs. Foodstuffs grew from the parts of his body. 21 \n\nNearly all religions incorporate hidden hints of cannibalism. Apart \nfrom the sacrament of god-devouring that Christianity shared with \npaganism, the primitive church was accused of real cannibalism. Ro- \nmans claimed the Christians sacrificed and ate children, and dipped \ntheir host in children\'s blood. Orthodox authorities didn\'t deny these \ncharges, but insisted only the Gnostic sects were to blame. Justin \nMartyr said the Marcionites practiced incest and cannibalism. Eusebius \nof Caesarea said the Carpocratians did it. Epiphanius said the \nMontanists and Ophites did it. Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, and \nthe 5th-century Presbyter Salvian all blamed heretic Christians for \nholding anthropophagus rites that brought disgrace on the church. 22 \n\nDespite powerful taboos, cannibalism was not unknown in medi- \neval Europe. In periods of famine or plague, when many starved to \ndeath in the streets of European towns, bodies sometimes simply \ndisappeared. In 1435 the Sawney Beane family of Galloway was \naccused of having lived on a diet of human flesh for generations; but \nthey were tortured to death by the court at Edinburgh, which may \nrender their confessions suspect. 23 In 1661, four Scottish "witches" \nwere tortured into confessing that they ate an unbaptized child dug up \nfrom the Forfar churchyard. 24 This seems improbable, since the \nunbaptized were not buried in churchyards.

See Furies; Kingship. \n\n\n\nCaste \n\n\n\nCaste \n\nInventors of the caste system were Indo-European patrilineal tribes \nwhose early migrations destroyed many centers of Neolithic matriarchy; \nyet they had to attribute their social hierarchy to the authority of \nMother Earth, the Goddess of final authority. Their eastern offshoots, \ncalling themselves Aryans, conquered northwestern India and \nbrought a Dark Age to a formerly flourishing civilization, about the \nmiddle of the 2nd millenium B.C. Like the priests of western Europe \nin a later Dark Age, the Aryan priests devised the caste system to \nrelegate native peoples to a lower status, and to preserve this order \nwith a claim of divine ordinance. \n\nThis doctrine taught that all those born into low rank were living \nout a necessary punishment for sin in a previous existence, even \nthough they may not remember it. Their duty was to accept their lot \nwithout complaint, work hard, and obey their superiors, so as to win a \npromotion in the next life. It was perhaps the most effective method of \npreserving a hierarchy that human ingenuity has ever produced. 1 \n\nUnder the rule of the warlike Aryan Aesir, who conquered \nScandinavia\'s earlier matriarchal tribes, "the castes and professions \nare regarded as reflections in the human sphere of the laws of the \nnatural order." 2 The father of Teutonic castes was Rig-Heimdall, \n"King of the Sea-Home." Their mother was the Triple Goddess Earth \nin all three of her forms. \n\nRig-Heimdall lay with Edda the Great-Grandmother, oldest of \nGoddesses, and begot a son named Thrall, "Slave." Then he lay with \nAmma, the Grandmother, and begot a son named Karl, "Freeman." \nThey he lay with Modir, the Mother, and begot a son named Jarl, \n"Earl, prince." These three were ancestors of the castes. \n\nThe same Rig-Heimdall was named Ram, the phallus. He was \nsacrificed as a Horned God. Like Scyld, Arthur, and other pagan \nheroes he was born of the ninth wave of the sea. His Magic Song said \nhe was born of nine maidens, daughters of the Elder Race, another \nmultiplication of the same Triple Goddess, everywhere the Mother- \nBride. The Nine made him strong with the sea\'s cold strength and \nwith sacrificial blood. 3 \n\nRig-Heimdall resembled the Vedic fire god Agni, Son of the \nWaters, who returned to the waters at his death. Some say Agni is \nperiodically reincarnated in the Dalai Lama, another "Son of the Sea." \nThe Rig Veda said of Agni, "He with clear flames unfed with wood, \nshines in the waters." 4 This was not marine luminescence, but an \nallegory of the ancient idea that blood was sea water infused with fire, \nthe element of living heat (see Elements). As the god in dying fertilized \nMother Earth with blood, so fire dying in water turned the cold brine \n\n\n\n141 \n\n\n\nCastration into warm red blood of life. This was the primitive theory behind the \n\n"mating of fire and water" in both Norse and Vedic myth. \n\nhp^ B^BH Apart from the castes in both eastern and western Aryan societies \n\nwere the outcastes: India\'s Untouchables, or pariahs. Their duties \nwere "carrying water and chopping firewood." Their virtue consisted of \naccepting these chores and attending to them faithfully. 5 It is no coincid- \nence, but a tradition of genuine Indo-European origin, that the Bible \nspeaks of outcasts who could not be touched, but were allowed to live \nas "hewers of wood and drawers of water" (Joshua 9:21). Yahweh\'s \nscribes pretended the idea came from their ancestors, but obviously \nit was borrowed from Far-Eastern concepts of the caste system. \n\n1. de Camp, A.E., 294. 2.

Campbell, Or.M., 459. \n\n\n\nCastration \n\nAll mythologies suggest that, before men understood their reproduc- \ntive role, they tried to "make women" of themselves in the hope of \nachieving womanlike fertility. Methods included couvade or imitation \nchildbirth; mock death and rebirth through artificial male mothers; \nceremonial use of red substances to imitate menstrual blood; and \ntransvestism. Another method was ceremonial castration. Its primitive \nobject was to turn a male body into a female one, replacing dangling \ngenitals with a bleeding hole. (See Birth-giving, Male.) \n\nMany gods became pseudo-mothers by this means. Egypt\'s solar \ngod Ra castrated himself to bring forth a race called the Ammiu out \nof his blood. 1 The phallus of the Hindu "Great God," Mahadeva, was \nremoved and chopped to pieces by priestesses of the Goddess. The \npieces entered the earth and gave birth to a new race of men, the \nLingajas (Men of the lingam, or phallus). 2 In a Chukchi variant, the \nGreat God Raven acquired feminine secrets of magic for men by \npounding his own penis to a pudding and feeding it to the Goddess \nMiti (Mother). 3 In Mexico, the savior Quetzalcoatl made new humans \nto repopulate the earth after the Flood by cutting his penis and giving \nblood to the Lady of the Serpent Skirt the Goddess with many shorn \nphalli dangling about her waist, a figure also known in the Middle \nEast, e.g. as Anath. 4 \n\nSeveral forms of the Heavenly Father became creators by a rite of \ncastration. The god Bel cut his "head" (of the penis) and mixed his \nblood with clay to make men and animals, copying the magic of Mother \nNinhursag. 5 Shamin, the Phoenicians\' Father Heaven, was castrated \nby his son El and made the world\'s rivers from his blood, imitating the \nGoddess\'s menstrual magic. Arabs called this god Shams-on, the sun. \nThe Bible called him Samson, whose blindness and hair-cutting were \nboth mythic metaphors of castration. \n\nShearing the sun god\'s "hair" (rays) meant emasculating him. His \nsevered penis represented the son/supplanter; and a penis was often \ncalled "the little blind one," or "the one-eyed god." Greeks\' personifica- \n\n\n\n142 \n\n\n\ntion of the phallus, Priapus, was the son of Aphrodite and her \ncastrated consort Adonis. Their Roman counterparts Vesta and Vulcan \nproduced a phallic god Caeculus, "the little blind one." 6 \n\nUranus, "Father Heaven," was castrated by his son Cronus. \nUranus\'s severed genitals entered the sea-womb and fertilized it to \nproduce a new incarnation of the Virgin Aphrodite Urania, "Celestial \nAphrodite." It was she who ruled the earlier cults of castrated gods, \nsuch as Anchises and Adonis. She was the same as the Canaanites\' Lady \nof the Serpent Skirt: her priests castrated gods in her honor. \n\nSo did the priests of Aphrodite\'s Nordic counterpart, Freya-Skadi. \nThe Nordic Father Heaven was Odin, whose twelfth holy name was \nJalkr, "Eunuch." 7 As a castrated god, Odin was the son-phallus of an \nolder Eunuch personifying both father and son; for Odin was also the \nOne-Eyed God, or Volsi, a "stallion penis." 8 (See Horse.) Like the \nstallion of the Vedic horse sacrifice, he was castrated. A late myth tried \nto account for Odin\'s crude phallic title by saying he could not drink \nof the cosmic feminine fountain of wisdom until he had given up one of \nhis eyes. 9 Here one might recall the alternating seasonal castrations \nof Set and Horus in Egypt, their severed phalli mythologically described \n\n\n\nCastration \n\n\n\nas "eyes.\' 10 \n\n\n\nBiblical writers called the penis a "sinew that shrank," lying "upon \nthe hollow of the thigh." This was the sinew that Jacob lost in his \nduel with "a man who was a god." Jacob, "the Supplanter," was \nanother name for Seth, or Set, who was likewise symbolized by the \nLadder of Souls and likewise engaged in a contest with his rival, ending \nin his castration. 11 When Set was castrated, his blood was spread over \nthe fields in the annual ceremony of sowing so as to fertilize the crops. 12 \n\nThe Book of Genesis confuses the two aspects of the god-king, \nwho as Jacob won his battle with the incumbent king and supplanted \nhim, then as Israel lost his battle with the next supplanter, and was \ncastrated. Is-Ra-El may have been a corruption of Isis-Ra-El, the god \nenthroned as the consort of his goddess, awaiting the next challenger. 13 \nThe syllable El meant his deification. \n\nThe garbled story of Jacob and the god-man was inserted chiefly to \nsupport the Jews\' taboo on eating a penis (Genesis 32:32), formerly a \nhabit of sacred kings upon their accession to the throne. The genitals of \nthe defeated antagonist were eaten by the victor, to pass the phallic \nspirit from one "god" to the next. A king\'s virtu, "manliness," or heill, \n"holiness," dwelt in his genitals because that was his point of contact \nwith the Goddess-queen. Innumerable myths of father-castrating, moth- \ner-marrying god-kings arose, not so much from inner Oedipal \njealousies as from actual customs of royal succession in antiquity. See \nKingship; Oedipus. \n\nThe Greek King Aegeus died at the very moment when his "son," \nTheseus, arrived from Crete to claim his throne. The key to this \nmyth is that Aegeus was "rendered sterile" by a curse, the same ritual \ncurse laid on all kings of outworn usefulness, followed very shortly \nby castration and death. 14 \n\n\n\n143 \n\n\n\nCastration In the sacred dramas of Canaan, the reed scepter of the dying god \n\nMot was broken, to signify his castration. 15 His name, meaning "steril- \n^^ mmmm ^^^^^ ity" or "death," was a title of the fertility god Aleyin (Baal) as he \n\nentered his declining phase, when his rival assumed the sacred throne, \nand he became Lord of Death. 16 The custom of eating the defeated \nking\'s genitals appears in a number of Middle-Eastern myths, e.g., that \nof the Hittite god Kumarbi, one of a line of father-castrating kings of \nheaven. 17 Kumarbi\'s assumption of the fertility-spirit was expressed \nby the story that he "became pregnant." \n\nMythic fathers and sons demonstrated remarkable hostility toward \neach other\'s genitals. Scholars tend to regard this as an expression of \nOedipal aggressions, originating in the jealousy of elder males toward \nyounger, more virile ones. Though men eventually gave up the \nhopeless idea of making one of their number pregnant by redesigning \nhis body in a feminine style, customs of castration and crypto- \ncastration persisted because they offered an outlet for this male jealousy. \n\nAmong savages, men\'s puberty ceremonies generally provided an \nexcuse for elder men\'s attacks on the bodies of youths. Modified \ncastrations may be inflicted in the form of circumcision, subincision, and \nother genital wounds; also a variety of torments such as scarifying \nflesh, knocking out teeth, beatings, torture, and homosexual rape. 18 \n"The dramatized anger of both the father and the circumciser and the \nmyths of the original initiation in which all the boys were killed, \ncertainly show the Oedipal aggression of the elder generation as the \nbasic drive behind initiation." 19 \n\nThe more patriarchal the society, the more brutal its attacks on \nmale youth, as a general rule. Notable for brutality was the Moslems\' Es- \nselkh or scarification ceremony, a complete flaying of skin from a \nboy\'s scrotum, penis, and groin. After enduring this, the victim was \nfurther tormented by application of salt and hot sand, and buried up \nto the waist in a dunghill, making subsequent infection almost inevita- \nble. Burton commented, "This ordeal was sometimes fatal." 20 \nLegman pointed out that both Islam and Judaism "share in the surgical \nintimidation of the son by the father, just at the threshold of puberty, \neither in the psychological castration of circumcision at puberty (Mo- \nhammedanism), or this same operation effected at the earlier age of \neight days (Judaism), or in a reminiscence of this operation." 21 \n\nSubincision provides an example of transition from a female- \nimitative rationale to a male sado-masochistic ritual. As practiced by \nthe Arunta, it began with a long sliver of bone inserted into the urethra. \nThe youth\'s penis was then sawed open with a sharp flint, down to \nthe level of the bone. Blood flowing from the wound was directed onto \na sacred fire, like the menstrual blood of girls at menarche. The \noperation was termed "man\'s menstruation." 22 The wound was called a \n"vagina." 23 \n\nThe obvious purpose of this unpleasantness was to transform a \nmale into a pseudo-female. The mutilated youth was even obliged to \nurinate by squatting, like a woman. Sometimes, men renewed the \n\n\n\n144 \n\n\n\ndamage several times over, repeating the litany: "We are not separat- Castration \n\ned from the mother; for we two are one."\' 24 Natives said the custom \n\nwas begun by an ancestral spirit, Mulkari or Mu-Kari, perhaps a _^^__^^^ \n\ncorrupt form of Mother Kali (Ma-Kali), who was known as Kari in ^""^^^^ \n\nMalaysia. 25 \n\nFar from supporting the Freudian doctrine of penis envy, primitive \ncustoms seem to suggest vulva envy as the original motive behind \nritual castrations. It might be found even in civilized society. Bettelheim \nremarked on the desire of some young men to be circumcised, or \notherwise subjected to bloodletting, when their girl friends were starting \nto menstruate. 26 Circumcision was surely a modified form of earlier, \nfemale-imitative castrations. \n\nThe institution of circumcision was attributed to the same gods, \nsuch as El, who castrated their fathers. Its object was to feminize. In \nIndia, boys were dressed as girls, nose ring and all, on the eve of the cir- \ncumcision ceremony. In ancient Egypt also, boys on their way to \ncircumcision wore girls\' clothing, and were followed by a woman \nsprinkling salt, a common Egyptian symbol of life-giving menstrual \nblood. 27 \n\nCircumcision took place at the age of thirteen, the number of \nmonths in a year according to ancient menstrual calendars, and the \ntraditional age of menarche. After copying circumcision from the \nEgyptians, Jews transferred it to the period of infancy, leaving the \npubertal ceremony, now called bar mitzvah, awkwardly placed at a point \nin a boy\'s life when nothing really happens, in contrast to the sudden \nonset of menarche in a girl. \n\nInfant circumcision was attributed to Moses, who insisted on it \nagainst the will of his Midianite wife Zipporah, who apparently \nobjected to mutilation of her infant. After performing the operation, she \nflung the foreskin at Moses\'s feet, calling him a bloody husband \n(Exodus 4:25). \n\nOther biblical passages show that foreskins were considered appro- \npriate offerings to Yahweh. David bought his wife Michal from \nYahweh\'s representative the king, with 200 Philistine foreskins (1 \nSamuel 18:27). Other Heavenly Fathers made similar demands for \ngenital gifts. Male animals sacrificed to Rome\'s Heavenly Father Jupiter \nwere gelded. 28 The bull representing the castrated savior Attis was \nalso castrated. 29 His blood conferred spiritual rebirth on those who \nbathed in it, like the blood of the Christian "Lamb," as if it were the \nsecret blood of the womb, the real source of life according to the oldest \nbeliefs. 30 \n\nCastration as a means of acquiring feminine powers was still evi- \ndent among priesthoods of the Great Mother, along with other \nfemale-imitative devices such as transvestism. Self-emasculated priests in \nfemale clothing served the Indian Goddess under her name of \nHudigamma. 31 Similar eunuch priests tended Middle-Eastern temples \nlike those of the Dea Syria at Hierapolis, Artemis-Diana in Anatolia, \nand the Magna Mater in Phrygia and Rome. 32 The famous seer of \n\n\n\n145 \n\n\n\nCastration Thebes, Teiresias, got his powers of second sight and prophecy by \n\nbecoming a woman, possibly by castration, and living as a temple harlot \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m for seven years. \n\nPerhaps the best-known self-emasculators in the ancient world \nwere priests of Attis and Cybele, the Great Mother. As Attis was \ncastrated and poured out his lifeblood to fructify her, so his priests in \nimitation of his sacrifice cut off their genitals and gave them to the \nGoddess\'s image.
