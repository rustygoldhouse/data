Patriarchal societies insisted \nm pecking orders; matriarchal ones tended to be more egalitarian. 72 \nNeolithic village cultures with their matriarchal family-based govern- \nnents were cooperative, unwarlike, and nonviolent. Their lack of \nlestructiveness has been attributed to the life-loving spirit of affirmation \nhat scholars find at the core of most matriarchal societies. 73 \n\nThe same spirit of affirmation has been found in matriarchal or \niemi-matriarchal societies of the recent past. American Indians who \nvorshipped the female principle, and were ruled by tribal chiefs elected \n>y the real leaders, called Female Governesses, surprised Christian \nnissionaries with behavior more "Christian" than that of white men. A \nnissionary said, "What is extremely surprising in men whose external \nippearance is wholly barbarous, is to see them treat one another with a \njentleness and consideration which one does not find among com- \nnon people in the most civilized countries." Indian women were \n\n\n\n687 \n\n\n\nMotherhood known as the Life of the Nation, and Mistresses of the Soil. 74 In \n\nanswer to a white questioner who couldn\'t understand the Indian \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ reverence for women, one Indian man said, "Of course the men \nfollow the wishes of the women; they are our mothers." 75 \n\nEven aggressive savages like the Dobu Islanders regarded mother- \nhood as the only possible antidote to warfare. Mutual trust was \nmaintained exclusively among members of a matrilineal kinship group \nknown as "mother\'s milk." 76 Societies where women set the stan- \ndards of behavior and morality were found generally kinder than \nmale-dominated societies. Children grew up without harsh punish- \nments, expecting kindness from others as a matter of course and \nconsequently developing into nonhostile, nonviolent adults. Envy, \ngreed, and exploitiveness were minimal; depression almost unknown; \ncrime almost unheard-of. People were generally good-humored, \ntrustful, and confident. Women were treated as the equals of men. \nAttitudes toward sexuality tended to be positive and permissive. \nPeople seemed to feel sure Mother Nature would provide for their \nneeds, even in cases where a harsh environment demanded hard \nwork for the sake of survival. 77 \n\nSocieties dominated by men tended to introduce cruel punish- \nments, hostility toward the young, formalized rivalry, and sadistic \nelements replacing easy, affectionate sexuality. Some of this may have \nbeen biologically based. Among animals, females care for the young, \nmales fight for mates, and care only for themselves. The primitive \nhuman female "nourished, reared and protected the more feeble \nthan herself, while her mate, a terrible savage, knew only how to pursue \nand kill." 78 \n\nWhen new-born humanity was learning to stand upright, it depended \nmuch on its mother and stood close to her protecting side. Then \nwomen were goddesses, they conducted divine worship, women \'s voice I \nwas heard in council, she was loved and revered and genealogies were \nreckoned through her. What broke into this feminine Elysium and robbed \nit of liberty and happiness? The male of the species. As the race grew \nolder, rationality flourished at the expense of moral sense. . . . Man, \nunmindful of the mother\'s contributions to racial uplift and welfare, \nthought only of bending every energy and forcing tribute from everything^ \nand every one who could elevate himself and give him dominating \npower. . . . There\'s no more reason for not killing humans who oppose \nyou than for sparing the lives of mosquitoes, in the mind of a man \nwhose self-seeking emotions are permitted to run rampant. And the \naverage "normal" male\'s personality balance tends definitely in the \nsame direction. \n\nBachofen said, "The idea of motherhood produces a sense of \nuniversal fraternity among all men, which dies with the development of ^ \npaternity." Ancient societies believed that those related by mother- \nblood shared a common soul, so no member of the group could hurt \nanother without doing injury to himself. Egyptians and other folk \n\n\n\n688 \n\n\n\ncarefully distinguished between children of the same mother and Motherhood \n\nchildren of the same father; the former were the "real" siblings, \n\nconstrained to care for each other as for their own selves. As Telema- \n\nchus remarked, a person must be told who his father is; the mother is ^^^^^^^^" \n\nthe parent every child knows "of himself." 80 \n\nPsychologists agree that the images of Mother and Father affect \n:he psyche in different ways. Feelings of connectedness are more closely \nassociated with the mother; feelings of dissociation or alienation with \nthe father. In spiritual terms, outer and inner worlds of nature and the \nelf were not separated under a matriarchal order, whereas patriarchy \ninsisted on their absolute severance. 81 \n\nPast societies dreaded even a temporary loss of the mother image. \n\\puleius spoke of the period when the Goddess departed from the \nvorld for her season of self-renewal: "There has been no pleasure, no \noy, no merriment anywhere, but all things lie in rude unkempt \nleglect; wedlock and true friendship and parents\' love for their children \nlave vanished from the earth; there is one vast disorder, one hateful \noathing and foul disregard of all the bonds of love." 82 When the \n[goddess permanently disappeared from theological imagery, the \nense of alienation became universal: \n\nThe earlier, neolithic order was of the female above the male, the cosmic \nmother above the father . . . with the progressive devaluation of the \nmother-goddess in favor of the father, which everywhere accompanied the \nmaturation of the dynastic state and patriarchy. . . . A sense of essential \nseparation from the supreme value symbol became in time the characteris- \ntic religious sentiment of the entire Near East. 83 \n\nG. R. Taylor\'s classification of "matrist" and "patrist" societies \nshowed guilt, negativism, and fear in the latter, as opposed to a more \n:onfident outlook in the former. Matrist societies were typified by: ( 1 ) \n>ermissive attitude toward sex; (2) freedom for women; (3) high \neminine status; (4) welfare more valued than chastity; (5) democratic \nlitical principles; (6) progressive views; (7) spontaneity, exhibition; (8) \nex differences minimized; (9) hedonism, pleasure welcomed; (10) \nnother worship. Patrist societies displayed opposite tendencies: (1) \nestrictive attitude toward sex; (2) restriction of women; (3) women \neen as inferior, sinful; (4) chastity more valued than welfare; (5) \nluthoritarian politics; (6) conservative, against innovation; (7) inhibi- \nion, fear of spontaneity; (8) sex differences maximized, e.g. in dress; (9) \near of pleasure, ascetic self-denial; (10) father worship. 84 \n\nWorshippers of the Great Mother celebrated rites of "love," \nncluding sexual love, which was often taken as a symbol for all loves, \njxpressed in gestures and acts similar to those of mother-child behavior: \ncuddling, breast-sucking, and so on. Conversely, votaries of the \nr ather were ordered to "fear" him (Deuteronomy 6:13). St. Paul \neclared that those who had no fear of God were automatically \ninners (Romans 3:18). Christianity gave its followers much to fear, \nncluding one of the most sadistic hells ever devised by the human \n\n\n\n689 \n\n\n\nMotherhood imagination, and an implacable God who consigned "most" human \n\nbeings to that hell forever, according to his theologians (see Hell). \n\n^^^^^^^ m ^^^ m But the primitive Mother gave comfort and reassurance. Eskimo sha- \nmans still call her the soul of the universe, never seen, but her voice \ncan be heard: "a gentle voice, like a woman, a voice so fine and gentle \nthat even children cannot become afraid. What it says is \'Be not \nafraid of the universe.\' " 85 \n\nMontagu says the mother image is still used to alleviate terror. \n"When the male\'s defenses are down, when he is in extremis, when \nhe is dying, his last, like his first word, is likely to be \'mother,\' in a \nresurgence of his feeling for the mother he has never repudiated, but \nfrom whom he had been forced, at the overt level, to disengage \nhimself." 86 Eugene O\'Neill expressed the secret longing in a dramat- \nic speech: \n\nThe mistake began when God was created in a male image. . . . That \nmakes life so perverted, and death so unnatural. We should have \nimagined life as created in the birth-pain of God the Mother. Then we \nwould understand why we, Her children, have inherited pain, for we \nwould know that our life\'s rhythm beats from Her great heart, torn with \nthe agony of love and birth. And we would feel that death meant \nreunion with Her, a passing back into her substance, blood of Her blood \nagain, peace of Her peace! Now wouldn \'t that be more logical and \nsatisfying than having God a male whose chest thunders with egotism and \\ \nis too hard for tired heads and thoroughly comfortless? 87 \n\nThe Kagaba Indians expressed the same sentiments in a less \nsophisticated but equally forceful song describing their Goddess: \n\nThe Mother of Songs, the mother of our whole seed, bore us in the \nbeginning. She is the mother of all races of men and the mother of all \ntribes. She is the mother of thunder, the mother of the rivers, the mother \nof trees and of all kinds of things. She is the mother of songs and \ndances. She is the mother of the older brother stones. She is the mother of \nthe grain and the mother of all things. . . . She is the mother of the \ndance paraphernalia and of all temples, and the only mother we have. She \nis the mother of the animals, the only one, and the mother of the Milky \nWay. It was the mother herself who began to baptize. She gave us the \nlimestone coca dish. She is the mother of the rain, the only one we \nhave. She alone is the mother of things, she alone. And the mother has \nleft a memory in all the temples. With her sons, the saviors, she left \nsongs and dances as a reminder. 88 \n\nPsychologists often regard the universal myth of the Golden \nAge as a symbol of childhood. Yet when Plato wrote of the Golden \nAge, he apparently took some details from matriarchal societies \nfamiliar to the Greeks as either contemporary or belonging to the recent \npast. He said there was "no wildness nor eating of each other, nor any \nwar, nor revolt amongst them. . . . There were no governments nor \n\n\n\n690 \n\n\n\nwrate possessions of women and children. For all men rose again Motherhood \n\nim the earth remembering nothing of their past. And such things as \n\nvate property and families did not exist." 89 This was regarded as a ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nment of Plato\'s imagination until research discovered the pre-urban \n\nmmunity of the Neolithic cultivator: \n\nThere was no ruling class to exploit the villagers, no compulsion to work \nfor a surplus the local community was not allowed to consume, no taste \nfor idle luxury, no jealous claim to private property, no exorbitant desire \nfor power, no institutional war. Though scholars have long contemptu- \nously dismissed the "myth of the Golden Age, " it is their scholarship, \nrather than the myth, that must now be questioned. \n\nSuch a society had indeed come into existence at the end of the last \nIce Age, if not before, when the long process of domestication had \ncome to a head in the establishment of small, stable communities with an \nabundant and varied food supply: communities whose capacity to \nproduce a surplus ofstorable grain gave security and adequate nurture to \nthe young. The rise in vitality was enhanced by vivid biological \ninsight. 90 \n\nAt Catal Huyuk, in what is now southern Turkey, a matriarchal \nnmunity of the 7th millenium B.C., there was no evidence of \neftainship or rivalry, though there were many priestesses. Children \nre buried in the tombs of their mothers. Art and handicrafts flour- \ned, producing obsidian mirrors, copper and lead jewelry and tools, \nollen textiles, artistically carved wooden vessels. For 1 500 years \nen times as long as the existence of the United States of Ameri- \nthe community seemed free of massacre or war. Though many \nndreds of skeletons have been found, none showed any sign of \nilent death. 91 \n\nMatriarchal Sumeria dominated the Fertile Crescent for 3000 \nirs with virtually no evidence of warfare. 92 Neolithic foundations of \nh peaceful societies have been unearthed at Hassuna, Tell Halaf, \nmarra, and Ubaid where there were no gods. Holy icons showed \nly naked women holding or nursing infants. 93 Patriarchal religions \nidually ousted the ancient matriarchies, chiefly by violence; but \nne scholars have suggested that this revolution was neither satisfac- \ny nor final. The Great Mother, ostensibly overthrown by her sons, \nin ineradicable archetype dwelling somewhere in the psyche of every \nman being born of woman which means, of course, every \nman being. The more emphatically she is denied, the more threaten- \n5 her images appear. 94 Ancient myths were not merely allegorizing \nlen they spoke of the furious wrath of a neglected deity. \n\nEven scholars refrain from noticing the everyday words for ances- \nthat clearly indicated matrilineal descent: "forebears," for \nimple, a short form of "fore-bearers." Ancestry is called extraction, \nd obvious reference to what one came out of; similarly descent is \n\n\n\n691 \n\n\n\nMotherhood the "descending" from the womb. From the beginning, it was materr \n\nspirit that fostered cooperation and togetherness in work or worship. \n\n^^^^^^i The maternal totemic clan was by far the most successful form that \n\nhuman association has assumed it may indeed be said that it has been \nthe only successful one. . . . Political organizations, religious theocracies \nStates, nations, have endeavored in vain to achieve real and complete \nsocial solidarity. They are artificial structures; social humanity has nevei \nsucceeded in adequately replacing the primitive bond to which it owes \nits existence. 9S \n\nMedieval ballads depict a pagan world where mothers were the \nultimate authority in every household. Sons appealed to mothers, not \nfathers, in times of crisis, as the ballad-hero Johnie Cock asked the \nhelp of his mother, and through her, of the Goddess. Christianity \nhowever was devoted to destruction of the Goddess and her temples \n(Acts 19:27). Clement of Alexandria quoted Christ: "I have come to \ndestroy the works of the female." 96 Christ ordered his followers to \nrenounce their families (Luke 14:26) and said to his own mother, \n"Woman, what have I to do with thee?" (John 2:4). Fathers of the \nchurch wrote diatribes against motherhood. 97 Western religion conse- \nquently became an exercise in male-dominated power-seeking. 98 \n\nMany male scholars still try to pretend there never was a \nGoddess, or if there was, she was only a "cult" figure vaguely associab \nwith sexual promiscuity and/or "fertility." It is not recognized that \nreligious feeling for the Mother was, if anything, much deeper and \nmore passionate than feelings for a divine patriarch. Deities of both \nsexes are styled "gods." Egyptian sacred art showing divine persons w \nobvious dangling breasts, is described as a picture of "gods." 99 \nScholars carefully avoid quoting ancient texts that say the Primordial \nBeing was a Creatress, not a Creator. Though she was the central \nunifying concept of ancient civilizations, the Great Mother isn\'t men- \ntioned in ancient-history texts. Scholars\' violent denial of the \nevidence for the prehistoric matriarchate causes one to suspect that thi \nprejudices often blind their eyes, as if a patriarchal culture prevents its \nmembers from comprehending any foreign viewpoint. 100 \n\nFreud\'s ignorance of feminine values left him incapable of undei \nstanding humanity\'s most basic bonds. He gave sexuality a primary \nsignificance that probably should have been relegated to the mother- \nchild bond instead. Freud admitted that thirty years of practice never \ntaught him what women really want because, of course, he had \nalready convinced himself that what every woman wanted was a \npenis. 101 He even went so far as to imagine that a mother loved her \nchild only because it was, for her, a penis-substitute. \n\nThe reason for Freud\'s failure of insight here should by now be plain: in \nhis analysis of the development of the self, he left out of account the \n\n\n\n692 \n\n\n\n\n\n\npositive influence of the other member of the family, the mother. Motherhood \n\nOveremphasizing, if anything, the rule of the father, the/ovean, \n\npower-seeking, repressive, organizing element in the personality, he \n\nplayed down the function of the mother, with her life-bestowing gifts, ^^^^^^ammm^^m \n\nher relaxing and yielding attitudes, her life-transmitting and life-nurturing \n\nfunctions: the mother\'s sympathy and responsiveness, her giving of the \n\nbreast to her infant, her special effort to establish an I-and-thou intimacy \n\nthrough language, her endless ways of expressing love. W2 \n\nFreudian phallocentrism added to Christian devaluation of the \nfemale tended to perpetuate the common pattern of troubled families, \nas described by a social worker: "There\'s always a husband who\'s \nwitholding his emotional support and a wife who\'s unhappy, whose \neeling of personal worth has been damaged." 10? Mumford points \naut that devaluation of motherhood leaves children of both sexes cut off \nrom a vital experience, the essential basis of all future commitments \nto cooperative functioning in the social context. "In repressing the \nmothering and nurturing impulses, in the personality, the scientist has \nilso lost the normal parental concern for the future life it cherishes. One \nlardly knows whether to characterize this attitude as innocence or \natalism; it certainly indicates a failure to reach maturity." 104 \n\nGilder theorizes that few men can attain psychological maturity at \nill without a vital connection with the sense of futurity through \nntimate association with a woman. She has, "as part of her very \nxuality, a sense of the future: a sense of evolution and growth, a \nlotion of deferring pleasures for future gains, a sense of the phases and \nleasons of life, a devotion to the value of the individual human being. \nThese sentiments are the very source of human morality." 105 Indeed \nhese are precisely the sentiments embodied in matriarchal religions\' \ncyclic, future-oriented view of life. Such religions were free of the \nleurotic quest for indefinable "meaning" in life, since they never \nissumed that life would be required to justify itself. They were also \njenerally free of the anxiety, guilt, and sense of sin imposed by \n>atriarchal religions, evolved by males made insecure from earliest \nhildhood by a social order based on male intimidation and \nlominance. \n\nMight-is-right morality was typical of the linear, hierarchical mas- \nculine theology. Feminine morality seems to have been both more \niubtle and more affirmative, fostering the same spirit of close coopera- \nion that enabled humanity to become civilized in the first place. \n\nDespite the basic male need to take part in feminine values, the \n>atriarchal society seems to be organized the other way: women are \nbreed to attain a sense of personal worth by taking part in masculine \nvalues. Instead of aspiring happily to the worthy estate of mother- \nlood, many women are taught to think it unworthy while they are still \nn the "bosom" of the patriarchal family: \n\n\n\n693 \n\n\n\nMotherhood The upwardly mobile career of every go-getting woman seems to have \n\nbeen her father\'s gift to her. As a sop to his male guilt, Daddy may have \n\ngoaded daughter to achievements he willfully denied his wife; or as a sop \n\nto his male vanity, he may have engendered in her such hurtful feelings \nof female worthlessness that only the adoption of a male-style existence \ncould appease. But always, it seems, daughter has been vicariously \nwounded by damage the maternal ego suffered at paternal hands. She may \nfeel compassion for her mother\'s plight, or contempt that "Mama let \nPapa get away with it, " or a mixture of both emotions, but she invariably \ngrows up with an almost pathologic horror of "living out Mom \'s life all \nover again." 106 \n\nBriffault and other scholars believed devaluation of the maternal \nrole inflicted injury on males as well as females: "Men have much more \nof the \'patriarchal theory\' to unlearn. Women have to learn that all \nracial ideals that are worth while are ultimately identical with their own \nelemental instincts, and are the outcome of them. . . . The compro- \nmises that govern the relations between the sexes are those that \ncondition all true human values. ... It is, as of old, the part of the \nVestal Mothers to tend the Sacred Fires. Upon women falls the task not \nonly of throwing off their economic dependence, but of rescuing \nfrom the like thraldom the deepest realities of which they were the first \nmothers." 107 \n\nEven Buddha reached back to basic maternal imagery in his \nDiscourse on Universal Love: "As a mother, even at the risk of her \nown life, protects and loves her child, her only child, so let a man \ncultivate love without measure toward the whole world, above, \nbelow, and around, unstinted, unmixed with any feeling of differing or \nopposing interests. . . . This state of mind is the best in the world." 108 \nBut no man could achieve it without Motherhood as a model. \n\nI. Briffault 1,191. 2. Neumann, A.C.U., 1 1. 3. Frazer, G.B., 45-46, 138. \n\n4.

This was "going a-mothering." Herrick mentioned the custom \nn his canzonet to the nymph Dianeme, probably Diana of Nemi. \nThe simnel was a manikin, Gingerbread Man, similitude, or Host: a god \neremonially eaten. 1 \n\n1. Brewster, 144. \n\n\n\nMountain \n\n\'erhaps more than any other natural objects, mountains most often \nepresented the Great Mother. In every land the mountains were \ndentified with breasts, belly, or mons veneris of the Earth, as well as \nhe paradise where gods live. \n\nChomo-Lung-Ma, "Goddess-Mother of the Universe," is the \nworld\'s highest mountain, known in the west, typically, by the name \n)f a man: Mount Everest. Nearby rises Annapurna, "Great Breast Full \n>f Nourishment." 1 There is also Nanda Devi, "Blessed Goddess," \nnother of the river-goddess Ganga (Ganges). These mountains are \nome of the Primal Mothers called Himalaya, "Mountains of Heav- \n:n," which gave rise to the Germanic Himmel, "heaven." 2 \n\nNorthern Europeans called the home of the gods Himinbjorg, \nleaven-Mountain. 3 The gods lived on the "lap" of the Great \nMother. "This notion of a mountainous situation of the home of the \n;ods is one shared by other Indo-European races such as the Greeks \nvho settled their pantheon on Mount Olympus; it is surely behind the \nwalmist\'s \'I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh \nny help.\'" 4 \n\nSnow-covered, breast-shaped mountains were considered the \nource of "help" (or food) from the benevolent Goddess whose white \nnilk was really water: glacier-fed streams whose waters were often white \nvith suspended rock dust. The Mountain Mother was both a source \n)f life-giving waters, and a Queen of Heaven. One of the oldest titles of \n\n\n\n695 \n\n\n\nMountain \n\n\n\nDravidian Referring \nto the cultures of the \nDravidian language \ngroup in southern and \ncentral India, now \nranging from highly \ncivilized people to \npreliterate forest primi- \ntives. Dravidian \nlanguages were rooted \nin pre-Aryan Indus \nValley civilization, the \nearliest known in \nIndia. \n\n\n\nthe Hindu triple Goddess Parvati-Kali-Uma was Daughter of Heaven j \n(Himalaya). 5 According to the Greeks, the Goddess formerly ruled not I \nonly Mount Olympus, home of the classic gods, but all mountains; \nhence her title Panorma, "Universal Mountain Mother." 6 \n\nOne of the archaic Goddesses was Niobe, "Snowy One," identi- \\ \nfied with Mount Sipylus, where a water-streaming crag still bears the \ncarved image of a Hittite mother goddess. 7 Mountainous breasts rise in i \nCounty Kerry, Ireland, as double peaks called the Paps of Anu that \nis, the ancestral Goddess Anu, or Danu, mother of the Tuatha De \nDanann. 8 Samoyed shamans believe they must experience a vision of \nclimbing a magic mountain, where they will meet the Lady of Waters. \nShe is a naked Goddess who accepts the shaman by allowing him to \nfeed at her breast, saying, "You are my child; that is why I let you suckle \nat my breast." 9 \n\nSumero-Babylonian texts spoke of the Mother-mountain where \nthe sun god was daily born and nightly swallowed up. This was \nMashu, "Twin Peaks," as high as the walls of heaven, dwelling in the \nwestern garden of paradise by the shores of Ocean. 10 The twin peaks \nwere breasts nourishing heaven, and the mountain had another set of 3 \n"paps" reaching downward to nourish the underworld, as if it were \nthe two-faced Goddess of life and death. The way into the land of death \nwas into the Mother-mountain\'s body, via the Road of the Chariot, \nor Road of No Return. 1 \' \n\nThere was a curious resemblance between Mashu of the Sumeri- \nans and Macchu Picchu of the Peruvian Incas, another twin-peaked \nholy mountain where the sun rose and set, tended by priestesses. There \nas in distant Sumeria, the common name of the Goddess was \nMama. 12 \n\nThe Hindu pantheon was settled on Mount Meru, or Sumeru, the \n"Good Mountain" located in the north, pointing to an archaic \nconnection between India and Sumeria. 13 The Chinese located their 1 \nMount of Paradise in the same general vicinity as Sumeria, in the \nwest. It produced the usual four rivers and was surrounded by "red \nwater" like the River of Blood that surrounded ancient Fairylands. 14 \nSee Menstrual Blood. \n\nIranians said the Lofty Mountain-Mother stood at the center of trK \nearth. She was called High Haraiti. At her summit was the Navel of \nWaters, "for the fountain of all waters springs there, guarded by a \nmajestic and beneficent Goddess." The Vedas say Yama, Lord of \nDeath, sits in the midst of the celestial ocean in her highest heaven, oni \nthe Navel of Waters, where "matter first took form." 15 The Japanese \ncombined him with the Mountain-Mother Fuji the Ancestress, and the \nmagic mountain came to be called Fujiyama. 16 \n\nA very old Dravidian form of the mountain-Mother was Hariti, \nwho nursed five hundred supernatural beings at once. 17 The gods she I \n\n\n\n696 \n\n\n\nupported on her lap recall archetypal images of the infant enthroned on Mountain \n\nhe mother\'s body, which is simultaneously "earth" and "paradise." \n\ndyths hold many indications of the child-parent relationship between ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhe god and his feminine support. One of the emblems of Isis was \n\nhe Mu\'at, "foundation of the throne," meaning hers was the lap the \n\niharaoh and his divine alter ego sat on, on earth as well as in heaven. \n\nThe Persian sun god Ahura Mazda lived in a glowing palace on \nhe summit of Mount Hara, a derivative of Hariti. 18 In Hebrew, hara \ntieant both "mountain" and "pregnant belly." 19 In Latin the word \nescribed the official diviners called haruspices, those who gaze into \n!ie belly that is, entrail-readers. 20 \n\nThe idea of the Mount of Paradise as the Goddess\'s belly or vulva \npd to the widespread belief that life-giving rivers of blood emanated \nrom it, the "four rivers of paradise" common to Asiatic traditions, \nientified with real rivers by the Bible with lofty disregard for their \neography (Genesis 2:10-14). One of these rivers was Gihon, the \nlebrew name for the Nile, coming from "the whole land of \nEthiopia." The name was a corruption of Gehenna or Ge-enna, the \nliver of Ge (Gaea), or of Mother Earth. Or again, the Nile was \nupposed to emanate from the Mountain of the Moon (Ruwenzori) \n(eyond Ethiopia. \n\nThis was one of the universal female-symbolic images in mytholo- \ny: the lunar mountain, located in a garden of paradise, containing a \nreat cave or labyrinth, producing the rivers of life. Its genital connota- \non could hardly be overlooked. Arabs called it Jebel Ka-Mar, the \nMother-mountain. Even in medieval European romances it was the \naurce of wisdom; Merlin learned his magic by drinking of its \nmbrosia. Anointed knights of Charlemagne, searching for the same \nDurce, traveled to a great cavern under a Mountain of the Moon at \nle headwaters of the Nile. 21 \n\nEgyptians eventually transferred the mystic source of the Nile \nfom the remote Mountains of the Moon to the handier first cataract \nt Elephantine (modern Jazirat Aswan). This was regarded as the earth\'s \nDni, where the God mated with the Goddess, to produce the annual \nutpouring of the Nile. The genital metaphor of the mountain is still \njggested by the word mons, meaning both a mountain and a female \nenital. 22 \n\nPyramids and ziggurats were artificial mountains built where the \nd was flat, to serve as thrones of the Lord, "high places" for his \ncred marriage to the Goddess, earth-wombs for his regeneration, and \nlrines. Like the Celtic tumulus, a Buddhist reliquary mound or \niipa was also an imitation of the holy mountain, often likened to the \nlother\'s belly. 25 Similar tombs on a larger scale were the Mycenaean \nwhs tombs, covered with tons of earth to make artificial hills. 24 \n\nEastern lamas were interred in domes or pyramids plated with gold \n\n\n\nin \n\n\n\n697 \n\n\n\nMountain whenever possible, because imperishable gold was the metal of \n\napotheosis and immortality, making the body imperishable also. 25 In the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ west, where gold was not plentiful, the magic mountain was said to be \nmade of glass or crystal, in imitation of the seven crystalline spheres of \nheaven. The Celtic after-world centered on a glass castle, perhaps a \nmisunderstanding of the old word glas, meaning "the blue of heav- \nen." 26 But the crystal mountain was sometimes taken literally. At the \nCeltic burial mound of New Grange, the surface of the earth-womb wa \nonce covered by quartz fragments to make it sparkle in the sun like a \nmound of crystal. 27 The Slavs believed in a crystalline mountain of \nheaven, and used to bury bear\'s claws with the dead, to help them \nscramble up the slippery glass. 28 \n\nThe expression "in seventh heaven" came from the ancient \nbelief that the seven celestial spheres were arranged like a seven-story \nmountain, as shown by the Babylonian ziggurat of seven stages. 29 \nBelow ground, seven concentric "hells" or "pits" reflected the celestial \nrealm in Sheol, its mirror image in the Abyss, ruled by the queen of \nthe underworld, who had many names Allatu, Eresh-kigal, Persepho- \nne, Hel, Hecate, Nephthys, or the earlier female Pluto but always a \ndark alter ego of the celestial Goddess. 30 \n\nThe Babylonian netherworld was "divided into seven zones, like \nthose of Dante\'s Inferno, upon the model of the seven planetary \n\nspheres. . . . Seven gates gave admission, each guarded by a porter \n\nThis idea of the circles of the underworld is also found in the \nEgyptian mythology of the ritual of the dead." Like the biblical Joseph, \nAssyrian priests went down into the Pit as part of their death-rebirth \ninitiations. There at the base of the celestial mountain in the land of the \nBlack Sun, stood "the foundations of the earth, the meeting of the \nmighty waters." 51 \n\nInitiations everywhere enacted a journey through the nether and \ncelestial spheres, a symbolic ascent of the mountain. The Norse \nfather-god Odin himself had to win his wisdom by traversing the "seven \nnether spheres" of death. 32 Apuleius described his own initiation into \nthe Mysteries of Isis as a journey to the land of death, where he beheld \nthe Black Sun, and saw the deities of the upper and lower worlds \n"face to face." Then he rose to the heights, and was exhibited to the \ncongregation in the costume of the sun god. Mithraic initiates \nsimilarly rose through seven spheres, winning the ranks of Raven, \nBridegroom, Warrior, Lion, Persian, Sun-runner, and Pater (high \npriest). 33 \n\nArabs perpetuated the basic Chaldean notion of the cosmos as a \nmagic mountain with seven ascending spheres and seven under- \nground ones; this in turn was based on the Hindu image of Purusha, the \nuniverse personified. "According to the common opinion of the \nArabs, there are seven heavens, one above the other, and seven earths, \n\n\n\n698 \n\n\n\none beneath another. . . . This is explained by a passage of the Koran Mountain \n\nI in which it is said that God created seven heavens and as many earths or \n\ni storeys of the earth." 34 Medieval Christians inherited the same idea, ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n| modeling their cosmos on that of ancient Chaldea. The church officially \n\n(listed the heavens as aerial, ethereal, Olympian, the heaven of fire, \n\nthe heaven of stars, the crystalline, and the Empyrean. In the seventh \n\njheaven "Christ dwells, and this is the especial and proper dwelling \n\niplace of Christ and the angels and saints." 35 \n\nThus the magic mountain was taken over by Christianity, but at \nthe same time the church vigorously condemned all the magic \nimountains where "witchcraft" carried on worship of the Goddess. Puy- \nde-D6me in Auvergne was a famous witch-mountain; so was the \nBrocken or Blocksberg in the Hartz Mountains. Puy-de-D6me had a \n(temple served by women called fatuae, "fairies" or "fates," and \n\\fatidicae, "seeresses." Young girls were periodically initiated into the \nsect, under the novice-title of bonnes EUes} 6 \n\nA map made of the Brocken in 175 1 noted that its summit was a \nwitches\' ground, where sabbats were celebrated before an altar by a \nmagic spring, "formerly consecrated to some false deity of the pa- \ngans." 37 This may have been the mountain Pope Pius II called Mons \nj Veneris, where one could meet witches and demons, "address them and \nlearn the magic arts." 38 \n\nThe story of Tannhauser\'s sojourn in the Mons Veneris or Mount \nof Venus (Venusberg) was another relic of fairy-religion, hinting at \nthe existence of a real high priestess powerful enough to defy the pope, \nand serving the Goddess under the name of Queen Sybil. The \nGoddess "still resided in the megalithic temples of western Europe, \nwhich were old before the Greeks invaded Greece. Although her \nrites were officially forbidden, her worship was celebrated on magical \nmountains throughout Europe. She came to be confused with the \nclassical goddess Venus, and her magic mountains were called Venus- \nbergs in Germany, where the written versions of the Tannhauser \nmyth seem to have originated. Her worship was celebrated at several \niireal mountains: Horselberg, Waldsee, Freiburg, and Wolkenstein, as \n\nwell as at peaks in Italy and Scotland In all the Tannhauser myths, \n\nthe Queen Sybil is the Goddess Venus." ?9 \n\nSybil was a Latinization of Cybele, the Great Mother of the Gods, \nwhose worship actually continued in secret up to the 20th century on \nIwild mountaintops in her native Anatolia. Her rites "contained primitive \nusages of the religion of Anatolia, some of which have survived to this \njday in spite of Christianity and Islam. Like the Kizil-Bash peasants of \nloday, the ancient inhabitants of the peninsula met on the summits of \njjmountains covered with woods no ax had desecrated, and celebrated \ntheir festal days." 40 \n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, men believed the Goddess could \n\n\n\n699 \n\n\n\nMourdad-Ameretat invite them into the interior of her magic mountain, as shown by \nMudra many tales Tannha*user was not the only Venus-loving hero. The \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ Danish ballad of The El fen Hill speaks of a youth enchanted by an \n\nelf-maid\'s dancing, and invited by her to the interior of her hill. 41 There \' \nwere even indications that the Mountain-goddess was still a trinity. \nAccording to the Thuringian Chronicle of 1 398, she appeared at mid- j \nday as three great flames in the air, "which presently ran together in \none great globe of flame, parted again and finally sank into the \nHorselbcrg." 42 \n\nThe Mother-mountains continued to shelter pagan gods, who \nwere thought to be not dead but sleeping in the terrestrial womb, \nawaiting rebirth like Hindu gods between their incarnations. Merlin, \nWilliam Tell, Barbarossa, Frederick, and others slept in magic moun- \ntains. Many were assimilated to "the figure of Wotan, which survi \nthese legends of emperors and empires. It is Wotan who is awaiting \nto reappear in this world ... a dark heathen god-image that has not been \ntaken into account by the prevailing attitude of consciousness. " 4 * \n\nI, Neumann.

Scipio the Elder said \nhe spheres "produce seven distinct tones; the septenary number is the \nlucleus of all that exists. And men, who know how to imitate this \nelestial harmony with the lyre, have traced their way back to the \nublime realm." 2 Led by Thalia, who governed music in general, the \nlassical Muses were Clio (history), Calliope (heroic poetry), Terpsicho- \ne (dance), Melpomene (tragedy), Erato (erotic poetry), Euterpe \nflute accompaniments), Polyhymnia (sacred songs), and Urania, the \nCelestial Aphrodite of the plane of the fixed stars. The Alexandrian \nhrine of the Muses was the Museum, "the nearest thing to a modern \nmiversity that the ancient world experienced." 3 It was destroyed by \nchristians, who detested pagan learning. \n\n1.

The \nirst of Mut\'s three heads was the Virgin Maat, wearing the plumes of \n""ruth. The second was Hathor, Mother of the World, wearing the \ned-and-white crowns of the Two Lands. The third, painted black and \nrearing vulture feathers, was Nekhbet, the Crone of Death. 1 The \n!Joddess\'s trinitarian name may have been a cognate of Kali\'s name \n\n\n\n701 \n\n\n\nMutspell Mutteyalamma, one of her manifestations as a disease-causing \n\nMyrrh Destroyer. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Mut mothered all the gods of Egypt.

As the Crone-mother Skadi, she would lay her doom \non the world, and spirits from the hot southern lands of Mutspellheim \nwould begin to destroy the earth, a mythic reminder of Kali the \nDestroyer in her original territory. See Doomsday. \n\n\n\nMylitta \n\n"Birth-producer," a Carthaginian name for the Goddess who, He- \nrodotus said, was Alitta in Arabia, Venus Mylitta in Assyria, and Mitra \nin Persia. 1 Carthage had a province named after her, Magasmelita, \n"Shrine of Mylitta." Like the fish-mother Atargatis or Tirgata, she \npersonified the primal womb of the Abyss. 2 She espoused the sun god \nand "quenched the blazing lingam" in the waters of her womb, like all \npersonifications of the female Deep. 5 The ancient city of Mdina on \nMalta used to bear her name. 4 \n\n1.

Myrrh \nwas an emblem of Mara, a common Oriental name for the spirit of \ndeath. 5 \n\n\n\n702 \n\n\n\nSome scholars have offered a theory that myrrh was given Jesus on \n(the cross to deaden his pain, because of a Jewish tradition that "the \njkindly women of Jerusalem" used to give myrrh to "those who were led \njout to execution." 4 The theory cannot be supported, since myrrh has \n|no analgesic properties. The women of Jerusalem apparently had \nanother, less kindly reason for giving myrrh to those executed; even \nearly Christians remembered that myrrh meant the death and rebirth of \nja god and was identified with his holy mother. \n\nIn the lore of magic, myrrh was credited with power to cause \n[menstruation: perhaps a relic of ancient legends of the castrated god\'s \nihedding of the "blood of life." 5 \n\n1.

Tatz & Kent, 79. 2. Graves, G.M. 1,13. \n\n\n\nNakedness \n\nTantric sages said one should participate in religious rites "sky clad" \n(digambara) or naked, because in the eyes of the Goddess all distinction: \nof rank, caste, or class should be put off along with the clothing that \nexpressed them. 1 The Goddess herself appeared naked, under the nam< \nof Nagna, "Nudity." 2 It was widely recognized that the magic of the \nGoddess dwelt more in the reality of her flesh than in her garments, \nsince creation was a function of the female body, not of any external \naccouterments. 3 Moreover, it was her nakedness that exerted its mysteri \nous power over the bodies of men. Images of the Naked Goddess \neven decorated churches until 1 1th and 12th centuries a.d., especially \nin the British Isles. Though many were destroyed, some of these \nimages still survive. 4 \n\nBy contrast to this earlier emphasis on nakedness, the magic of \nmen and their gods usually dwelt in their garments. Odin\'s sayings in \nthe Havamal show that he gave men clothes by which they would put \non "nobility" i.e., power for "the naked man is naught." 5 Patriar- \nchal societies generally made much of uniforms, vestments, badges of \nrank, and other decorations by which men defined themselves. \n\nPerhaps out of this same sense that nakedness enhanced the power \nof women and reduced that of men, Christians were usually opposed \nto nakedness even when it was practical, as among tropical peoples. \nAustralian missionaries refused to give food to hungry natives until \nthey put on clothes. A missionary in the Orinoco regretted that the \nnatives had not really accepted Christianity, but he confessed himself \n\n\n\n706 \n\n\n\nI "greatly consoled" at having taught native women such modesty that Nakedness \n\nI they would no longer remove their clothes even in bed. 6 \n\nEarly Christians condemned nakedness because it was characteris- ^ ^^ \nI tic of worship of the Goddess. The legend of St. Barnabas tells of the \n\nsaint\'s miraculous destruction of the temple of Aphrodite at Paphos, \n\nwere he saw "a multitude of men and women celebrating a feast, and \n\nrunning about naked. So wroth was he that he cursed the temple of \n\nthese pagans, and instantly the temple fell in ruins, crushing a large \n\nnumber of pagans in its fall." 7 \n\nA 4th-century Christian bishop named Priscillian seems to have \nI participated in pagan rites. He gave himself to "abominable studies, \n\nand held nightly meetings with immodest women and had been \n\naccustomed to pray stark naked." 8 \n\nMedieval books on sorcery taught that spirits can be raised by \nI ceremonial nudity, but this kind of magic is a degradation which "the \n\nfoolish dotage of women is subject to fall into." 9 Women continued to \n\nbelieve in the power of nakedness. Scottish maidens stripped them- \nI selves naked on the Eve of St. Andrew and recited a prayer "to learn \n\nwhat sort of husbands they shall have." 10 Pierre de Lancre wrote that \n\n"witches in their accursed assemblies are either entirely naked or en \nI chemise." 11 Up to the 17th century, ancient fertility rites dictated the \n\ngrinding of grain for festival cakes in Ireland with "certain stones," by \n\ngirls who had to be completely naked at the time. 12 \n\nAt the Bulgarian ceremony of the need-fire, "two young men \n\n\'whose names must not be spoken\' marched in front of the flocks and \n\nherds which were to be driven through the flames, and afterwards \n\nstripped themselves naked and kindled the new fire in a wood." At a \ni similar ceremony in Serbia, "a naked boy and girl lit the fire by rubbing \nj rollers of wood together." n Even in the present century, Balkan \ni peasants and gypsies performed ceremonies requiring them to go naked \nI in moonlight. 14 Witches sometimes maintain the "sky-clad" tradition, \nI as in the Middle Ages they were often accused of worshipping the \nj "great Devil" in the form of a large star when they went out naked at \n; night. Some medieval heretics called "shepherds" insisted on saying \nI Mass while naked, on the theory that "this was the way our father \n\nAdam sacrificed." The Inquisition condemned them, on the ground \n: that Adam didn\'t say Mass at all. 15 \n\nSt. Jerome established the church\'s policy on female nakedness by \n\nsaying women should be so ashamed of their own bodies that they \n\nshould "blush and feel overcome" at the sight of themselves. For this \n\nreason, no "virgin of full age" should bathe. If she was good-looking, \n\na woman must try to spoil her appearance by "a deliberate squalor" so \n\nshe wouldn\'t distract saintly men from their pure thoughts. 16 Among \n\nmedieval nuns therefore, clothing was seldom changed, and dirtiness \ni was thought next to godliness. \n\nIn the 1 5th century, the Adamites of Bohemia associated naked- \n\n\n\n707 \n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\nness with humanity\'s pristine purity, quoting the Bible (Genesis 3:7) \nto prove that garments were worn only after the first sin was committed. \nThey advocated nudity and free love to liberate the flesh from \nsinfulness. Their sect was exterminated in 1421. 17 \n\nNakedness often figured in secret initiations, as advised in a Frencl \nmystical book: "The aspirant should become stark naked, should \nempty himself completely, should be stripped of all his faculties, \nrenouncing all his own predilections, his own thoughts, his own \nwill in a word, his whole self." 18 Even here the "self" seemed to be \nclosely identified with the clothes which, as the world knows, \n"make the man." \n\n1.

"Irish ainm \nis \'name\' and anim is \n\'soul, anima.\' In cer- \ntain cases they are \ndeclined alike and \ntherefore often con- \nfused by students." ? \n\n\n\nName \n\nFor the purposes of magic and religion, the name of anything was \nconsidered identical with the thing itself, a spiritual "handle" by which \nthe thing or the supernatural being could be manipulated. Children \nand primitives seldom distinguish clearly between the reality and the \nname of an object. 1 The childlike mind of the Middle Ages couched \nthe same thought in pseudo-rational terms: "The proper names of \nthings are certain rays of things, everywhere present at all times, \nkeeping the power of things, as the essence of the thing signified." 2 \nLike other Europeans, ancient Britons believed the name and the \nsoul were the same. 4 \n\nEach Egyptian\'s soul-name, the ren, was breathed by a mother on \nher child as it was first put to her breast; therefore the Goddess of \nsoul-names was Renenet, who governed lactation. Without its ren, the \nchild would have no identity and would not be allowed to eat. Even \nthe gods needed mothers to give them names, otherwise they would \npine away and die. 5 The same belief is found in India: the "thousand- \neyed god" named Existence cried immediately after he was born, "Give \nme a name, for without a name I will not eat food." 6 \n\nName-giving was often connected with food-giving. The French \nstill give a child a nom de kit, milk-name, obviously recalling the pre- \nChristian matriarchy where only mothers could give names. 7 Chinese \nchildren received a "rice-name" with the first rice; it was supposed to \nembody the soul and was kept secret. 8 According to the Bible, infants \nwere named by their mothers, not their fathers. 9 Adam\'s naming of \nthe animals, however, was a magical means of making Adam their \nfather, after the manner of Shiva under his title of Prajapati, "Father \nof the Animals." \n\nTransitions from matriarchy to patriarchy were marked by fathers\' \n\n\n\n708 \n\n\n\ntakeover of the name-giving function. Brahmans insisted that fathers, Name \n\nnot mothers, breathed the essential soul-name into children; thus the \n\nsoul of a Brahman was called Atman, "the Breath," from which came m^mmm^^m^^^ \n\nGreek atmos and German atmen. At each Brahman wedding, long lists \ni of "begats" were recited to establish paternal ancestry. Imitators of \nS this eastern custom contributed the lists of spurious "begats" in the Old \ni Testament. 10 \n\nAncestor worship was instituted in matriarchal times, when tribal \nmothers became goddesses who gave their children names. When \npatriarchs became synonymous with gods, the system was copied for the \nother sex. Egyptian priests of Ra claimed their deity created all other \ngods by naming them: "It is Ra who made his own names into his \ni members, and these became the gods who are in his following. . . . \ni Ra created the Company of the Gods out of his own names." l \' This \n; was intended to uphold the priests\' contention that any god one cared \nto name was really Ra in disguise. But in a primeval time, Ra himself ex- \nisted only as a name within the being of his Mother, Ma-Nu, the \ncosmic abyss. 12 \n\nEgyptians remembered that the secret name embodying the soul \njwas mother-given. So did the Phoenicians, Babylonians, Scythians, \nI and Celtic and Germanic tribes who called themselves by mother\'s \nj names, which encompassed the tribal soul. 13 "Ask a Lycian who he \njis," Herodotus wrote, "and he answers by giving his own name, that of \nhis mother, and so on in the female line." H \n\nDespite Brahmanism, most of India retained the ancient system of \nmaternal name-giving. Distribution of family names was governed by \nthe Goddess under her title of Samjna or Saranyu, "the Name," or \n"Sign." 15 Chinese family names similarly incorporated the Mother- \nsign, a custom known to date back to the matriarchal age, before people \nknew their fathers. 16 The Japanese didn\'t use patronymics until 1400 \n|a.d. Previously, children took their mothers\' names. 17 See \nMotherhood. \n\nHellenic Greeks dated their transition from mother-names to \n\\ father-names back to a quarrel between the god Poseidon and the \ngoddess Athene. She won, but he oppressed the people to enforce his \ndemands. Athenian women were deprived of the vote, and men were \nforbidden to take their mother\'s names as they had done before. 18 \n\nEven when calling themselves "patrician" (father-descended), Ro- \ntman clans kept the feminine names originating in the pre- Roman \nmatriarchate, where only mothers embodied clan spirit. 19 The fact that \ni Roman women bore clan names like Julia, Claudia, Cornelia, Lucre- \nItia, etc., has been misunderstood as evidence of social oppression. \nI Bullough said, "Until fairly late in Roman history women even \nlacked individual names in the proper sense of the term . . . ; mothers \ni and daughters would have the same name." 20 He missed the point: \n! women bore the clan name because they embodied the clan soul, \nlipassed in matrilineal succession from mother to daughter. \n\n\n\n709 \n\n\n\nName The wholly patriarchal Christian system maintained patronymics \n\nthroughout. In nomenclature, women hardly existed at all. The only \n^ i name a woman kept for herself was her baptismal name, sacrosanct \nbecause it was ratified by a male god. Christian baptism didn\'t \nmention surnames, because in the middle ages there were still common- \nlaw rules providing for maternal surnames. Christian women received \nthe surnames of their fathers, but after marriage even these were given \nup, so the children inherited no name from the female line. Christian \nfathers like Brahman fathers gave children their names by speaking or \nsometimes writing them; hence the term "author of my being." Yet \nthe matronymic survived in some places, such as Spain, even though \nchurch councils declared maternal surnames illegal. 21 Scandinavia \nremained pagan up to the 1 1th century and retained older systems of \nnomenclature. Scandinavian women didn\'t take their husbands\' sur- \nnames until the 1 8th century. 22 \n\nThe great importance attached to names goes back to the \nearliest ages, and probably bears a profound psychological relationship t( \nthe human animal\'s unique ability to verbalize. Names were con- \nfused with souls almost everywhere. Egyptians said "To speak the name \nof the dead is to make them live again." Tomb inscriptions begged \npassers-by to speak the name of the entombed, to give "the breath of life \nto him who has vanished." 25 No greater harm could be done to an \nEgyptian than to erase the carving or writing of his name. To destroy \nthe very letters meant destruction of the soul. 24 \n\nRomans also wanted to preserve the name-soul after death. Romar \nepitaphs asked the passer-by to read the name aloud. Wealthy \nRomans often established endowments for a guild of friends and their \nsuccessors to celebrate their names at a banquet, at stated intervals on \nthe anniversary of death. 25 The Christian practice of writing names on \ntombstones developed from the Roman practice of re-creating the \nsoul in speech. \n\nSome said a major purpose of the epitaph was to induce deities to \nspeak the name, which would insure immortality because any word \nspoken by a god became reality. The spoken name in a divine mouth \nwould re-create the actual man. The pharaoh Sesostris I (1965-1934 \nB.C.) had his name inscribed on the benben-stone (obelisk), remarking \nthat "A name that standeth thereupon is mentioned [by the gods] and \nperisheth not in eternity." 26 For the same reason, Babylonian kings \nprayed to the Goddess Ishtar to give life to their names. 27 \n\nOn the other hand, a man or god could be cursed if his secret, \nmagical name was learned by an enemy and spoken in the wrong \ncontext. Isis spoke the secret soul-name of Ra to destroy him at the end \nof his daily cycle, making him an old man tottering feebly toward his \ndeath at sunset. 28 Knowledge of his name brought destruction to \nRumpelstiltzkin in the fairy tale, which may have been a late version \nof the myth of Ra and Isis. \n\nAt times the Goddess invoked the power of her own name, or \n\n\n\n710 \n\n\n\nseveral of her names, to release forces of creation or destruction. Isis Name \n\nI brought Osiris back to life by invoking herself as Isis and Nephthys. 29 \n\nI She fought the dragon of darkness and "obtained mastery over him in ^^^ mmm ^^^^^ \n\n| her name of Sekhet, she overpowered him in her name of Khut-nebat \nI (Eye of Flame)." 50 Names of the Goddess of creation and destruc- \nI tion were incongruously applied to Yahweh under his pagan-inspired \ni title El Schadaj related to schadajim, "milk-giving breasts," and \nI schadaj, "to destroy." 31 \n\nPrecedents older than civilization evolved the idea that forces of \n\ncreation and destruction could be activated by pronouncing a divine \nj name. The Mother of Gods controlled her offspring by knowledge of \nI their secret names. Early priestly theory proposed that these secret \nj names could be learned by human beings, who could then control the \n\ngods with them. Brahman priests claimed to control the gods\' actions \n\nwith mantras incorporating the divine names. Some of their lore was \n| embodied in the Upanishads, which means "secret names." 32 The \nj name of the Amida Buddha was so powerful that a priest could send \n\nhimself or any other man to the Western Paradise immediately only \n| by uttering it. 33 \n\nNaturally, priesthoods kept the knowledge of these dread names to \n{ themselves, as it would never do to let ordinary folk use them for free. \n\nHence the Jews\' taboo on taking the name of the Lord in vain. \n; Common people of the Semitic tribes didn\'t know their gods\' real \nI names; they called them simply El or Baal or Adonai, "the Lord." \ni When the name of the Jewish God became more widely known, the \n\nrabbis said its magic lay in its correct pronunciation, which could be \n\ncommunicated only once every seven years from an elder priest to a \n\nyounger. 34 The name was written on phylacteries which were said to \n\nkeep the bearer from every evil after many repetitions of the syllables. \n\nLearned Jews said "God brought Israel out of Egypt by means of a \n\nName which consisted of seventy-two Names." 35 \n\nThe Islamic Allah was even better equipped, with ninety-nine \n\nsecret names. Moslems claimed he would be compelled to answer \n\nany prayer if all these names were pronounced. Allah himself was called \n\n"the Essential Name," originally the milk-giving Goddess Al-Lat. 36 \n\nPious Moslems invoked Allah\'s name before sexual intercourse so no \n\nevil spirit could enter the womb and beget an evil child. 37 \n\nBoth Moslems and Christians inherited Jewish name-magic and \n\nbelieved that all sorts of miracles could be worked by invoking the \n\nname of God or the name of Christ, to say nothing of their secret \n\nnames. In the Middle Ages it was believed that any priest could \n\nabsolutely compel God to do whatever was asked, by conducting a Mass \n\nof the Holy Spirit which mentioned God\'s secret name. 38 The \n\npowers of God\'s name were explained by Henry Morley as follows: \n\nWhoever knows the true pronunciation of the name Jehovah the name \nfrom which all other divine names in the world spring as the branches \nfrom a tree, the name that binds together the sephiroth whoever has that \n\n\n\n711 \n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, \nexerting a powerful \ninfluence on the early \nGreek church. At first \nhe was accounted a \nsaint, but three \ncenturies after his \ndeath he was declared \na heretic because of \nGnostic elements \nfound in his writings. \n\nEnchiridion A book \nof magic spells, charms, \nand secret names \nallegedly written by \nPope Leo the Great, \nwho presented it to \nCharlemagne to in- \nsure his continuing \ngood luck. \n\n\n\nin his mouth has the world in his mouth. When it is spoken angels are \nstirred by the waves of sound. It rules ail creatures, works all miracles, it \ncommands all the inferior names of deity which are borne by the \nseveral angels that in heaven govern the respective nations of the earth. J9 \n\nEarly in the Christian era, when Christians were struggling to \nseparate their sect from Judaism, many stories were invented to prove \nthe name of Christ superior in magic efficacy to the name of God. \nOne such story from the Life of Pope Silvester told of a duel of holy \nnames performed by the pope and a Jewish rabbi, in the presence of \nthe Empress Helena, mother of Constantine. The Jew said God\'s secret \nname was so powerful that no unprepared creature could hear it and \nlive. To prove his point, he whispered the name into the ear of a bull, \nwhich immediately fell dead. Then the pope pronounced the secret \nname of Christ in the dead bull\'s other ear, saying, "Bull, arise; go back \nto thy herd"; and the bull got up and went. 40 Silvester scoffed at the \nJew\'s claim to mastery of the divine name\'s fatal power, asking him, \n"How is it, then, that thou thyself hast heard this Name and hast not \ndied?" 41 The Jew didn\'t answer. \n\nBoth Jewish and Christian Gnostics focused on the power of \ndivine names to bring about healing, exorcism, absolution, and \nsalvation. In the Pistis Sophia, Jesus told his disciples to "hide the \nmystery" of a great Name that could dissolve evil and "blot out all \nsins, done knowing or not knowing." 42 According to the Gospels, this \nwas the esoteric secret that Jesus concealed from all but his intimates. \nThe masses were not told, "lest at any time they should be converted, \nand their sins should be forgiven them" (Mark 4:1 1), indicating that \nearly Christianity like other mystery-religions addressed itself to a \nfavored few. Jesus gave the disciples his secret name, which had \npower to exorcise, when he said "In my name shall they cast out devils" \n(Mark 16:17). Seventy of his followers told him, "Lord, even the \ndevils are subject unto us through thy name" (Luke 10:17). Origen said \nJesus\'s name had "expelled myriads of evil spirits from the souls and \nbodies of men." 45 According to the Enchiridion, the powers of Jesus\'s \nname were so far-reaching that it was hard to see how anything could \npossibly go wrong in a world where it was spoken: \n\nO sacred Name, Name which strengthens the heart of man, Name of life, \nof salvation, of joy, precious Name, resplendent, glorious, agreeable \nName, which fortifies the sinner, Name which saves, conserves, leads and \nrules all . . . wheresoever the most sweet Name of Jesus is pronounced \n. . . the demons take flight, every knee is bent, all temptations, even the \nworst, are scattered, all infirmities are healed, all disputes and conflicts \nbetween the world, the flesh and the devil are ended, and the soul is rilled \nwith every heavenly delight. H \n\nThe esoteric secrets of Judeo-Christian name-magic were bor- \nrowed from Egypt, where the angels of light baffled the forces of \ndarkness with words of power, and set forth in works like the Book of \n\n\n\n712 \n\n\n\nlEnoch, which depicted the archangel Michael battling dark angels with Name \n\nIsimilar words: \n\nThis is the number ofKesbeel, who showed the head of the oath to the \n\nholy ones when he dwelt high above in glory, and its name is Beqa. \n\nAnd this angel requested Michael to show him the hidden name, that they \n\nmight mention it in the oath, so that those who revealed all that was \n\nhidden to the children of men might quake before that name and oath. \n\nAnd this is the power of that oath, for it is powerful and strong, and he \n\nplaced this oath Akae in the hand of Michael. 4t . \n\nThis passage was garbled Egyptian resurrection-magic. "Those \njwho revealed all that was hidden" were the serpent deities who gave \nimankind holy secrets, against the will of heaven. "The oath Akae" \njwas Aqa, the rudder of the boat of the dead, "shiner in the water, \nhidden beam." The name of Aqa had to be spoken before a dead \nIman could enter the boat that plied the heavenly Lake of Reeds. 46 It was \namong the words of power by which Ra\'s angels battled the dragon of \nnight: "When these gods rich in, magic spoke, it was the very spirit (ka) \nDf magic, for they were ordered to annihilate my enemies by the \neffective charms of their speech." 47 \n\nEthiopian and Abyssinian Christians retained the notions of \nEgyptian paganism in regard to words of power (hekau). Their vision of \npie War in Heaven was simply the battle between Ra and the serpent \nbf darkness. They said God\'s armies were twice overthrown, and Satan \nwas about to assume control of the universe, when God sent his \nangels one last time into the fight, armed with a cross of light bearing \nthe three secret names of the trinity. "When Satan saw the Cross and \nthe Three Names of Power, his boldness and courage forsook him, his \narms lost their strength and the weapons which he was wielding fell \nfrom them and he and his hosts turned their backs and were hurled \ndown into the abyss of hell by the now invincible angels of God." \nThe same trinity, however, came into being from the same abyss, the \nGreat Mother Ma-Nu, within whom the triple male god "at first \nexisted in name only." 48 That is, he/they came into being because the \n[Mother spoke his/their name(s). It was believed that the very exis- \ntence of this trinity depended on continual mention of its/their holy \nname in the mouths of men. \n\nEgyptian faith in the efficacy of speaking the trinitarian name was \nlaken over by Christians, who viewed "In the name of the Father, of \nihe Son, and of the Holy Ghost" as a magic formula second to none. It \ncould cure disease, chase away vermin, protect worldly goods and \nacquire more of them. 49 Pope Alexander III forbade monks to study \nmedicine, on the ground that all sickness was caused by demonic \n([possession and the only proper remedy was exorcism by the trinity\'s \noly names. 50 \n\nHoly names constituted the effective portion of any Christian \nremony. Absolution gave a typical formula: "I absolve thee from all \ny sins in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy \n\n\n\n713 \n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\nHenry Cornelius \nAgrippa von Nette- \n\nsheim (1486-1535) \nAustrian military officer, \nscholar, court histori- \nographer, and magus; \nauthor of the famous \nOccult Philosophy, \nwhich attempted to \nreconcile magic, theol- \nogy, physics, \nmathematics, alchemy, \nand cabalism. \n\n\n\nSpirit." Extreme unction was a string of invocations; \'in the Name of \nthe Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, may there be \nextinguished in thee every power of the Devil by the imposition of \nour hands, and by the invocation of all the holy Angels, Archangels, \nPatriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, and all \nthe Saints." Even longer lines of holy names marched through the \nlitany for the dying: "Go forth, Christian soul, from this world in the \nName of God the Father Almighty, who created thee; in the Name of \nthe Holy Spirit, who was poured out upon thee; in the Name of the \nholy and glorious Mother of God, the Virgin Mary," and so on, \nthrough long lists. Holy water for dedicating a church was exorcised \nwith the formula: "I conjure thee thou creature of water, in the name oi \nthe father, and of the son, and of the Holy-ghost, that thou drive the \ndevil out of every corner and hole of this church, and altar; so as he \nremain not within our precincts." 51 \n\nThe holy names were not merely symbols. Words spoken "in the \nname of Jesus" or "in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost" \nwere supposed to have absolute efficacy in expelling demons from \naltars, candles, fonts, even church hassocks, just as Egyptian hekau \ncould expel demons from a pyramid. 52 Certainly man never invented a \nweapon easier to use against the evil powers that he felt threatening \nhim on all sides. Nothing could induce him to abandon it, then or now. \n\nAgrippa von Nettesheim tried to explain the efficacy of holy name \nin pseudo-rational style, ending with a wholly irrational description of \nsuch names as "vehicles of Divine omnipotence, not fixed by men or by \nangels but by the great God himself in a certain way according to a \nnumber and figure which are unchangeable by reason of their eternal \nstability; they breathe the harmony of Divinity and are sanctified by \nGod\'s help. . . . The heavenly powers fear these Divine names, Hell \ntrembles at them, the angels worship them, the bad demons dread \nthem, all creatures revere them." 53 \n\nYet infernal names were considered just as effective as divine ones. \nRomanians converted the pagan Mother Death into a witch from the \nMount of Olives, called Avestitza, or "Wing of Satan." She was \ndangerous to most human beings, but could not harm anyone who \nlearned and wrote down her nineteen secret names. 54 \n\nPriests and magicians, Christian or pagan, operated on the same \npremise that the names of supernatural beings would call them and \ncompel them to perform the required task. Magic books and church \nliturgies were near akin in intention. One typical book of necromancy \nprovided impressive lists of secret names, guaranteed to work. \n\nThis is the earliest name ofTyphon, at which tremble the earth, the abyss, \nHades, heaven, the sun, the moon, the place of the stars and the whole \nphenomenal universe. When this name is spoken, it carries along with its \nforce gods and demons. It is the hundred-lettered name, the same \nname as last written. And when thou hast uttered it, the god or the dead \nperson who hears it will appear to thee and will answer concerning the \n\n\n\n714 \n\n\n\nthings you ask. And when you have learned all things, dismiss the god only \nwith the strong name, the one of the hundred letters, saying "Begone, \nLord, for thus wills and commands the great god!" Say the name and he \nwill depart. ss \n\nAnother source mixed Jewish and Greek gods in a spell for \njailing a spirit of divination into a vessel of water, also for breaking \nmains, blinding enemies, bringing dreams and divine favors. \n\nI invoke thee who created the earth and the bones (rocks) and all flesh and \nspirit and established the sea, and shakes the heavens and did divide the \nlight from the darkness, the great ordering mind, who disposes all, the \neverlasting eye, Demon of Demons, God of Gods, the Lord of Spirits, \nthe unwandering Aeon. Iao ouei, hearken unto my voice. I invoke thee \nthe ruler of the gods, high-thundering Zeus, O king Zeus Adonai, O \nLord Jehovah. lam he who invokes thee in the Syrian tongue as the great \ngod Zaaler iphphou (Baal-zephon), and do not disregard the sound in \nHebrew ablanathanalba abrasiloa. S6 \n\nThe longer and more sonorous the spell, the more holy or \njly names it mentioned, the more effective it was supposed to be. A \nal love-charm invoked Greek, Egyptian, and Babylonian under- \nld deities, as it was placed on a grave to carry the message down to \ni via the deceased. \n\nI place this charm down beside you, subterranean gods, Kore, Persepho- \nne, Ereshkigal and Adonis, Hermes the subterranean, Thoth and the \nstrong Anubis, who hold the keys of those in Hades, the gods of the \nunderworld and the daimons, those untimely reft away, men, women, \nyouths and maidens, year by year, month by month, day by day, hour by \nhour. I conjure you, all daimons assembled here. . . . Betake yourself to \nthat place and that street and that house and bring her hither, and bind \nher. . . . Let her sleep with none other, let her have no pleasurable \nintercourse with any other man, save with me alone. Let her neither drink \nnor eat, nor love, nor be strong nor well, let her have no sleep except \nwith me, because I conjure you by the terrible terror-striking name of him, \nwho, when his name is heard, will cause the earth hearing it to open; \nthe daimons, hearing his fearful name, will be afraid, the rivers and the \nrocks, hearing his name, will burst. S7 \n\nThe Christian church taught that no demon could be exorcised \nefore his own name was known, following the example of Jesus \n\'ho demanded the names of the devils he cast out of the Gadarene \nMark 5:9). The Rituale Romanum printed in 1947 prescribed that a \nriest must demand the devil\'s name and rank, "and the devil, like a \nrisoner of war, was in honor bound to respond." 58 Precedents dated \nack, not only to the Gospels, but also to the Magic Papyri where secret \names of God were multiplied endlessly in the effort to learn a spirit\'s \name: \n\n/ conjure thee by the God of the Hebrews, Jesus, Jaba, Jae, Abraoth, Aia, \nThoth, Ele, Elo, Aeo, Eu, Jiibaech, Abarmas, Jabarau, Abelbel, Lona, \nAbra, Maroia, Arm, appearing in fire, thou, Tannetis, in the midst of \n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\nRituale Romanum \n\nCatholic handbook of \nrites and ceremonies, \nwith prescribed phrases \nand gestures for every \noccasion. \n\n\n\nMagic Papyri \nCollections of \nexorcisms, invocations, \ncharms, and spells \nwidely circulated during \nthe early Christian \nera, used as bases for \nlater grimoires and \nHermetic texts. \n\n\n\n715 \n\n\n\nName plains, and snow, and mists; let thine inexorable angel descend and put \n\ninto safe keeping the wandering demon of this creature whom God has \n\n_^____ created in his holy Paradise. For I pray to the Holy God, putting my \n\nreliance in Ammonipsentancho. I conjure thee with a flood of bold wore \nJakuth, Ablanathanalba, Akramm. . . . Thou art Abrasiloth, Allelu, Jelo- \nsai, Jael: I conjure thee by him who manifested himself to Osrael by nigh \nin a pillar of Are and in a cloud by day and who has saved his people \nfrom the hard tasks of Pharaoh and brought down on Pharaoh the Ten \nPlagues because he would not hearken. I conjure thee, demoniac spirit, \nto say who thou art. For I conjure thee by the seal Solomon placed upon \nthe tongue of Jeremiah that he might speak. Say therefore who thou \nart, a celestial being or a spirit of the airs. S9 \n\nOne rabbinical tradition anathematized Christian use of holy \nnames to bring about everything from exorcism to resurrection; but \nChristianity could hardly have existed without it. Jesus said, "I have \nmanifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me. . . . And I \nhave declared unto them thy name" (John 17:6, 26), copying the \nEgyptian magician\'s secret communication of a divine name: "I am he \nwhom you [the god] met under the holy mountain and to whom you \ngave the knowledge of your greatest Name, which I shall keep holy, \ncommunicating it to none save to your fellow initiates in your holy \nrites." 60 Magic books attributed to Pope Honorius, famed as a wizard \ndespite his pontifical rank, plainly listed the seventy-two secret names \nof God and demonstrated their use in conjurations. For any modern \\ \nreader who may wish to test their efficacy, they are: Trinitas, Sother, \nMessias, Emmanuel, Sabahot, Adonay, Athanatos, Jesu, Pentagna, \nAgragon, Ischiros, Eleyson, Otheos, Tetragrammaton, Ely, Saday, \nAquila, Magnus Homo, Visio, Flos, Origo, Salvator, Alpha et Omega, \nPrimus, Novissimus, Principium et Finis, Primogenitus, Sapientia, \nVirtus, Paraclitus, Veritas, Via, Mediator, Medicus, Salus, Agnus, Ovis \nVitulus, Spes, Aries, Leo, Lux, Imago, Panis, Janua, Petra, Sponsa, \nPastor, Propheta, Sacerdos, Sanctus, Immortalitas, Jesus, Christus, Pa- \nter, Filius Hominis, Pater Omnipotens, Deus, Agios, Resurrectio, \nMischiros, Charitas, Aeternas, Creator, Redemptor, Unitas, Summum \nBonum, Infinitas, Jehovah, Agla, Sady, Gog and Magog. 61 \n\nChristians maintained even up to the present day the old pagan \nbelief that to speak the name of a dead person could call up his ghost, \ntherefore such a name must be accompanied by the formula "God rest \nhim," to keep him in the grave where he belonged. Pliny said Roman \npagans used the same formula for speaking of the dead. 62 It was also \nthought a disaster to have a dying person carry one\'s name in his \nmouth through the passage into death. If a dying man cursed his enem; \nby name, the enemy would also die, obviously in accord with the \nancient belief that a name was a vital part of the soul. 65 \n\nOne tradition Christians deliberately forgot, however, was the \noldest of all: that mothers gave children their name-souls while \nbaptizing them with milk from their breasts. Pagan mothers continued \n\n\n\n716 \n\n\n\nD do this, well into the Middle Ages; but it was specifically stated that Nammu \n\nbch a matriarchal baptism was never given to the Christ child. 64 Nana \n\n\n\nI.

Oxenstierna, 34. ^^^^____^^^^^^^_ \n\n\n\n. \n\n\n\nNecromancy \n\nDivination by the dead," one of the world\'s most popular forms of \nmagic, still widely practiced under the new name of spiritualism or \nmediumship. The basic idea was (and is) direct communication with \nthe dead, to discover the secrets of the after-life and the future. \n\nThe idea of necromancy underlay every salvation cult. Every \nSavior came back from the land of death to tell his followers how to \navoid its pitfalls and attain blissful immortality. Such information consti- \ntuted the Mystery-teachings of Orphism, of Eleusis, of Samothrace, \n\nI land of the Dionysian cults as well as those of Osiris, Pan, Adonis, \n\n| Tammuz, Krishna, Balder, Zalmoxis, and Christ. But not only \n\n. Saviors and sacred kings returned from the land of death. Any ghost \n\nI could do so, if properly summoned. \n\nHomer depicts Odysseus performing necromancy with sheep\'s \n\nt jblood, to call the dead from Hades and speak with them. 1 A gift of \nblood was always most welcome to the "shades" who were bloodless. \nThis idea led on to medieval terrors like vampires and revenants who \n\ni came back from the grave in search of blood. \n\nThe Bible shows Saul incapable of practicing necromancy for \n\nI himself, as Odysseus did. To consult the ghost of Samuel, Saul \nneeded the help of the wise-woman miscalled the "witch" of Endor. \nThe text does not describe her as a witch, but as a "woman that hath \n\n| a familiar spirit" (1 Samuel 28:7). She is an obvious fraud, presenting to \nSaul under cover of darkness an obscure figure hidden in a mantle, \nspeaking in whispers, as ghosts were supposed to do. Saul, overcome by \nsuperstitious terror, bows his face to the ground and never even tries \n\ni to get a good look at the apparition (1 Samuel 28:14). \n\nRomans also had necromantic specialists, though the ordinary \n\n> citizen could deal in a small way with ancestral ghosts, making \n\ni offerings to them on the nights of the Lemuria. 2 Once each year, priests \n\ni called up the ghosts dwelling in the pit under the lapis manalis or \n"soul stone" in the Forum, to consult them for omens. 3 \n\nNorthern tribes had similar customs, consulting ancestral ghosts at \nSamhain, the Feast of the Dead, which became Christians\' All \nHallows or Halloween. "Ghost" and "guest" both descended from \n\nBGermanic Geist because the death\'s-heads really did attend the feasts \nlas honored guests. 4 \n\nChristians also believed in, and practiced, necromancy. St. Clem- \n\n[ |ent the Roman, called the third pope after Peter, paid a necromancer \na large sum of money to call up a spirit from the underworld and \n(question it concerning the after-life. 5 Raising the dead Lazarus to life \n\n\n\n719 \n\n\n\nNehellenia \nNehushtan \n\n\n\nRituale Romanum \n\nCatholic handbook of \nrites and ceremonies, \nwith prescribed phrases \nand gestures for every \n\n\n\nagain for a while was one of the miracles that defined the divinity ol; \nChrist; yet, Scot asked, how is that "witches do the same, and it is \ncalled necromancy?" 6 \n\nNecromancy came to be known as "black magic" through a \nlinguistic blunder. The Greek root nekros, a corpse, was corrupted to j \nLatin niger, "black"; this gave nigromancy, the "black art." 7 \n\nA curious necromantic notion of the resurrection of the flesh \nunderlay the church\'s procedure for canceling excommunication of a \ncorpse. The Rituale Romanum said: \n\nIf the body be not yet buried, let it be lightly beaten with a rod or small \ncords after which it shall be absolved. . . . But if it hath been already \nburied in unconsecrated ground, if it may be conveniently done, let the \nbody be exhumed, and after it hath been lightly beaten in like manner \nand then absolved let it be buried in consecrated ground; but if the body \n\ncannot conveniently be disinterred, then the grave shall be beaten \n\nAnd if the body be already buried in consecrated ground, it shall not be \ndisinterred, but the grave shall be lightly beaten. 8 \n\nAs a rule, Christian authorities reserved for themselves all \ndealings with the dead and regarded any lay necromantic or spiritualist \nactivities as heresy, if not diabolism. In 1866 the Second Plenary \nCouncil of Baltimore forbade the faithful to attend seances, even if \nmotivated only by idle curiosity; "for some, at least, of the manifesta- \ntions must necessarily be ascribed to Satanic intervention since in no \nother manner can they be understood or explained." \n\n1.

Even Zeus feared \nNemesis, for she was once his destroyer and devourer, the Goddess \nwho gave both birth and death to all gods. 4 She was sometimes entitled \nAdrasteia, the Inescapable One. 5 \n\n1.

Mariette Bey wrote: "At the head of the \ngyptian pantheon soars a God who is one, immortal, uncreated, \njvisible and hidden in the inaccessible depths of his [sic] essence; he \nic] is the creator of the heavens and of the earth; he [sic] has made \nverything which exists and nothing has been made without him [sic]." \nbe Rouge gushed: "The unity of a supreme and self-existent being, \nis [sic] eternity, his [sic] almightiness, and eternal reproduction thereby \ni God; the immortality of the soul, completed by the dogma of \nunishments and rewards; such is the sublime and persistent base which \n1 . must secure for the beliefs of the ancient Egyptians a most \nonorable place among the religions of antiquity." \' \n\nDe Rouge and Mariette spoke of the concept of neter (also \nindered nether, nuter, or Nu), usually translated "God" or "gods" \nliough several of the seven Hathors had the name of Neter. They ruled \nie womb of rebirth, the seven-layered after-world known as Khert- \njleter or Neter-Khertet. 2 Male gods were called neter only when they \ntore artificial breasts. 3 Neteritox nutrit, "nurturer," was a common \n/nonym for "Goddess." 4 She-nit or She-neterv/ere Fate-goddesses \nwho form the conditions of the lives of men." 5 \n\nThe Book of the Dead distinguished between gods and the netriox \n\'utri: "I am devoted in my heart without feigning, O thou netri more \nnan gods." A king was told that in his after-life he lived "by the side of a \nieter" like a Hindu god with his shakti. Every king was warned that \n|e was "only the guardian of goods and provisions which belonged to \nhe neter." She provided all subsistence, and property, and children; \nhid she opposed would-be tyrants. 6 \n\nNeter netri was defined as "self-produced, primeval matter," the \n>cean of uterine blood before creation, holding future forms in the \nondition of formlessness or Chaos. Scholars actually translated this \noncept "Lake of God." 7 Its real meaning lay in the root syllable Nu, \n\n\n\nvar. Nether, Nuter, \nNu \n\n\n\nAuguste Mariette \n\n(1821-1881) French \nEgyptologist, discov- \nerer of the ruins of the \nSerapeum at Mem- \nphis, excavator at \nKarnak and other \nsites. He achieved the \nEgyptian ranks of \nBey and Pasha. \n\n\n\n723 \n\n\n\nNeter or Nut, "an ocean infinite in extent and of fathomless depth, bearing \n\nthe germs of all kinds of life," like Kali\'s primordial womb. The \n^ ma ^^ power of Nu was "the self-created," "maker of the gods," and "creato: \nof men." She existed before the sky, the earth, mortals, or gods. \nFrom Nu the sun was born; therefore Nu and the Great Mother were \none and the same. 8 \n\nThe sun went back into Mother Nu\'s "great gate" in the west \nwhen he died. Nu was also the hieroglyphic symbol of water that the \nGoddess Nut carried on her crown. Nu was the Triple Goddess, show \nin tomb carvings as three cauldrons. Nu "maketh fertile the watery \nmass of heaven, and maketh to come forth water on the mountains to \ngive life to men." 9 Nu became the Semitic nun, primal sea personi- \nfied as the Fish-mother (see Fish). She was incarnate in the sacred \nharlots of Erech, known as nu-gig. 10 \n\nThis primal sea was likened to the menstrual blood of the Great \nMother Goddess Tiamat, the creatress, who menstruated for three \nyears and three months to produce enough life-giving essence to give \nbirth to the universe. 11 This flow was the Nether Upsurge, or \nFountain of the Deep, emanating from her "holy door" designated by \nthe letter dahth or delta, the sign of the yoni. (See Demeter; \nTriangle.) \n\nWith a vowel point, dahth formed the Hebrew word ed, errone- \nously translated "mist" in Genesis 2:6: "But there went up a mist \nfrom the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground." The origin \nmeaning was not "mist" but something like a mighty fountain or \nspring, an unexplained upwelling of fluid from the bowels of the earth, \nwhich soaked the ground (adamah) to make it fertile, before the \nsending of rain from Father Heaven. This was what other Middle- \nEastern scriptures called the Nether Upsurge: female fluid from the \ndeeps, bursting forth to meet a male fluid from the clouds. 12 Other \nOriental sources show that the original sacrament of creation called \nfor a meeting of semen and menstrual blood "like the pouring of water \ninto water," as in the meeting and mingling of the powers of Kali and \nShiva, or of Tiamat and Apsu. Subsequently, adamah brought forth lift \n\nAdamah really meant "blood-red soil," and other myths clearly \nstate that the Nether Upsurge from the interior of Mother Earth was \nnot mist but life-giving uterine blood. The ancients often likened blood \nto salt water, which was regarded as the arche, the first of all elements \nfrom which the others were born. 13 Salt water was "birth fluid" \n(natron), representing regenerative Mother-blood. And Mother- \nblood was the vehicle of that world-creating spirit called neter, nether, \netc., which Egyptologists insisted on confusing with their own con- \ncept of God. \n\nTo the great and supreme Power which made the heavens, the gods, the \nearth, the sea, the sky, men and women, animals and creeping things, \nall that is and all that is yet to come into being, the Egyptians gave the \nname of neter or nether, a word which survives in Coptic under the \nform nuti . . . Dr. Brugsch defined neter to mean "the active power whic \n\n724 \n\n\n\nproduces and creates things in regular recurrence; which bestows new Nicholas, Saint \n\nlife upon them, and gives back to them their youthful vigor. . . " [T]he \n\ninnate conception of the word completely covers . . . the Latin natura ^^^^^^_^^^^_ \n\n. . . the great cosmic powers, and the beings who although held to be \n\n"divine" were yet finite and mortal . . . were called neteru, and the \n\nword is translated "gods" by Egyptologists. H \n\nIt seems, however, that "gods" didn\'t even begin to cover the \nue meaning of the ancient word neter, a relic of primitive matriarchal \nligion. Budge says: \n\nOne knows not exactly the meaning of the verb nuter, which forms the \nradical of the word neter, "god. " It is an idea analogous to "to \nbecome, " or "to renew oneself. " ... In other words, it has the meaning of \ngod, but it teaches us nothing as to the primitive value of this word. We \nmust be careful . . . not to let it suggest the modern religious or philosophi- \ncal definitions of god which are current today . . . ; neter appears to \nmean a being who has the power to generate life, and to maintain it when \ngenerated. IS \n\nNaturally, at the time when this crucial word was coined, the \nower to generate life was believed to be solely female (see Mother- \n:ood). It was the Goddess only who was "self-renewing" and the \njnirce of all "becoming." 16 Moreover, Egyptian writings contradict \nEgyptologists who want to call neterit "gods." The gods in the train \nr Ra were strongly differentiated from neterit, whom Ra\'s priests called \nWemptible beings. 17 In the time of Queen Hatshepsut, the neterit \nere not contemptible but divine beings; however, they "ruled without \na" and paid no attention to his commands.

Nicholas was also equated with Woden. As European pagan \ndeities were Christianized, the benevolent aspect of Woden became \nSt. Nicholas (Santa Claus), who galloped over housetops during the \nwinter solstice as the elder god did, granting boons to his worshippers \nbelow. 3 \n\nIn Italy, St. Nicholas supplanted a female boon-giving deity calta \nThe Grandmother, or Pasqua Epiphania, or Befana, who used to fill \nthe children\'s stockings with her gifts. 4 The Grandmother was ousted \nfrom her shrine at Bari, which became the center of St. Nicholas\'s \ncult. Christian sailors carried the saint\'s image out to sea on his feast da \nas pagan sailors formerly carried the image of the sea god or goddess. 5 \nSome bones were collected in the 1 1th century a.d., installed in a \nchurch built at Bari to house them, and labeled the bones of \nSt. Nicholas. 6 \n\nThis was the real beginning of St. Nicholas\'s cult, though his \nChristian legend claimed (quite without foundation) that he had been \na bishop of Myra in the 4th century. His official biography was \npreposterous. As an infant he fasted, said the hagiographers, taking \nhis mother\'s breast only once on Wednesdays and Fridays. He became \na bishop on account of his predecessor\'s prophetic dream, because he \nwas the first man to enter the church next day. He resurrected the dea* \nfrom a magic cauldron. He instantly halted a violent storm at sea to \nsave three drowning sailors. He miraculously multiplied a shipment of \ngrain to feed a whole diocese for two years, with enough seed left \nover for future crops vastly surpassing Christ\'s miracle of the loaves \nand fishes. After his death he achieved even greater feats. His bones \nexuded a fountain of holy oil that could cure every disease. 7 \n\nThe original pagan god Nicholas gave rise to a Gnostic sect of \nNicolaites who worshipped him with his cauldron of regeneration as a \nfertility figure. They "held that the only way to salvation lay through \nfrequent intercourse between the sexes." 8 Like other worshippers of \nthe sexual fertility principle, pagan or Christian, the Nicolaites were \nsurpressed; but sexual symbolism persisted in the sigil of St. Nicho- \nlas\'s Day in the runic almanac: a furka combined with a yonic mandorl \nIn ancient Egypt, this was a sign of the phallus of Set in conjunction \nwith the goddess\'s genital oval. 9 Another symbol of St. Nicholas was th \ncluster of three golden balls, adopted as a crest of the Medici family \nand later as a sign of pawnbrokers. 10 \n\nThe Dutch called St. Nicholas Sinte Klaas, and carried his cult to \nthe New World where the name was corrupted to Santa Claus. \n\n1.

An Irish Life of \nSt. Ninian claimed that he founded a church in Leinster, and identified \nhim with the god Monenni. The Martyrology of Talsnacht said \nMonenni was another name for the pagan goddess Nenn, or Nynia, \ncognate with the Danes\' Nanna. 1 Thus "Ninian" seems to have been \na legend built around a pagan idol of indeterminate sex, worshipped in \nRoman-style temple. \n\n1.

Pre-Christian \nligions viewed the Goddess Nyx-Selene (Night-Moon) as the agent \ndeification after death, which made her a direct rival of the Christian \nyior figure. 2 Her nixies were abyssal angels who kept the souls of \ne dead in an underwater fairyland, in "pots turned upside down," after \ne manner of all Teutonic death-spirits. 3 In the Middle Ages, the \nater-fairies assumed the same characteristics as their close relatives, the \n\n\n\n729 \n\n\n\nNoah mermaids, sirens, wilis, and water-witches: that is, they lured hapless \nNorm sailors into the water and magically devoured their souls. \n1.

"Ma" was the \nWomb of Chaos, often personified as a cosmic fish; "Nu" or Noah \nwas the embryonic seed of life floating into a new birth. See Creation; \nFlood; Tiamat. The flood-heroes of India, Sumeria, and Babylonia \nalso rode out the deluge of birth-fluid in a moon-vessel called argha or \nark, carrying with them the pairs of all creatures to populate the new \ncreation. 1 From the same root came arc, a crescent; for the vessel of \ncreation was always identified with the moon. \n\nl.Jobes, 121. \n\n\n\nNorns \n\nThe female trinity of Fates as she/they appeared in Scandinavia: also \nknown as Weird Sisters, from Teutonic wyrd, "fate." The Prose Edda \ncalled them "three mysterious beings," High One, Just-As-High, and \nThird, who revealed the secrets of the universe and wrote the book of \ndestiny; hence their other title, Die Schreiberinnen, "women who \nwrite." More common names for the Norns were Urth (Earth), \nVerthandi, and Skuld, variously translated Fate, Being, and Necessi- \nty, or like the ancient Egyptian Goddess of past, present, and future, , \n"Become, Becoming, and Shall-Be." 1 \n\nThe original, single, eldest Norn was Mother Earth, Ertha, Urth, \nUrdr, etc., who represented Fate and the Word of creation. She was \nWurd in Old High German, Wyrd in Anglo-Saxon, Weird in English: \nShe/they lived in the cave at the source of the Fountain of Life, \nUrdarbrunnr, the cosmic womb under the root of the World Tree. She \nthey were older than the oldest "heavenly father" and had power \nover every god. ? \n\nThe death-Norn Skuld was a variant of Skadi, an eponymous \nmother of Scandinavia and a typical Destroyer. Norse poet-shamans \nwere servants of Skuld and called themselves skalds; Christians said the \nindulged in witchcraft, or "skulduggery." Skuld would lay the death- \ncurse on the whole universe at doomsday. Her name apparently gave \nrise to "scold," meaning a woman gifted with the power of cursing. \nLike the third of the Moirai, Skuld cut the thread of every life. \n\nThe Norns became "fairies" in romantic traditions of pagan \nballadry: \n\n\n\n730 \n\n\n\nAnd lo!

Numa probably never existed, \nbut "his" name recalls the Oriental custom of creating some of the \nGoddess\'s spouses by reversing the syllables of her own name, e.g., \nYa-ma, Lord of Death, a reversal of Ma-ya, Lady of Life. Ma-Nu was a \nGoddess of Creation in some of the oldest Indo-European traditions, \nand Nu-Ma seems to have been her male counterpart. \n\n\n\nNun \n\nEgyptian word for the primal ocean, origin of the Hebrew letter nun \nkneaning "fish"; it was also a sacred name, as in "Joshua son of Nun" \n|(Joshua 1:1). As applied to a religious woman, "nun" descended \nfrom nonne, a nurse, because in antiquity priestesses were practjtioners \npf the healing arts. \n\n\n\nvar. Nuit \n\n\n\ntian Great Mother personifying the night sky.

Pepi II said he was living \n"between the thighs of Nut."

"Nymphs" served as priestesses \nin ancient temples of the Goddess, especially in sexual ceremonies, \nwhere they represented the divine principle of flowering fertility and \nwere sometimes known as Brides of God. See Virgin Birth. \n\nIn medieval times the word nymph was applied to either a witch 01 \na fairy, since both descended from the pre-Christian priestess. As \nspirits of nature, the "nymphs" were believed to embed their souls \nforever in certain parts of the natural world that the Goddess had \nruled in antiquity: there were water nymphs, tree nymphs, mountain \nnymphs, and nymphs who dwelt in the earth, the sea, or Fairyland. \nTheir ancient connection with sexuality was more or less consistently \nmaintained. Even now, "nymphomania" connotes sexual obsession, \nlike the moon-madness supposed to motivate the ancient nymphs in \ntheir seasons of mating. \n\n\n\nObelisk \n\nEgyptians knew the obelisk was intended to represent a giant phallus. \nIt was called the benben-stone, or begetter-stone, similar to the Petra, \n"the Rock that begat thee," as the Bible says. (See Peter, Saint.) \nUsually the obelisk was regarded as an erection of the earth god Geb in \nhis perpetual eagerness to mate with the Goddess of Heaven. 1 \n1.

Oceanus was often \nconfused with Neptune, Poseidon, Ouroboros, Taaut, or Python. \nOceanus was married to the primal Sea-goddess Tethys, or Thetis. \nHis name meant "He who belongs to the Swift Queen." * \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,27; 2, 402. \n\n\n\nOceanus \nOdin \n\n\n\nvar. Okeanos \n\n\n\nOdin \n\nNorse All-father, called God of the Hanged because the trees of his \nsacred grove at Uppsala were laden with hanged human sacrifices even \nas late as the 10th century. 1 Each victim\'s draumar (drama) recapitu- \nlated the death-rebirth of Odin himself, when he acquired his divine \npowers by giving himself up to immolation on the World Tree, \nwounded in the side with a spear. He said: "I know that I hung on the \nwindy tree for nine whole nights, wounded with the spear, dedicated \nto Odin, myself to myself." 2 \n\nThe occult significance of nine nights was pseudo-feminization for \nthe sake of creativity; it was the period sacred to women in childbirth. \nLatins called it the nundinum (nine-day). * Celts called it the nofnden \n(nine-night). On occasion the Goddess Macha inflicted a nine-night \nperiod of helplessness on men, which probably arose as a ceremonial \ncouvade whereby in primitive times the men tried to partake of \nwomen\'s powers. 4 The purpose of Odin\'s nine-night ordeal was to learn \nthe secret of the "wise blood" in the Earth-mother\'s uterine caul- \ndron, and to command the magic power of the runes, invented by his \nfeminine prototype Idun (Freya). After he traversed all the realms of \ndeath, he said, "I got a drink of the precious mead, I was sprinkled with \nOdrerir. Then I began to be fruitful and to be fertile, to grow and to \nprosper; one word sought another word from me." 5 \n\nBy his sacrifice Odin won for men the female secrets of the saga \n(speaking-woman, prophetess, priestess). He learned the runes, words \nof power, and sacred poetry, which his skalds called "the sea of Odin\'s \nbreast," meaning the blood he shed on the earth. 6 His myth evidently \npredated the discovery of fatherhood, for Erda or Urth was refreshed \nand fructified by his blood, not his semen. \n\nSometimes the tree of his martyrdom was represented by the Tau \ncross, also known as the Cross of St. Anthony or the Gibbet Cross. 7 \nAt other times, his gallows was door-shaped, with two upright tree \ntrunks and a crossbeam. This matched the poets\' description of \nOdin\'s gallows, Yggdrasil the "Terrible Horse," for the gallows was \nboth a tree and a horse on which men rode to the land of death. 8 The \n\n\n\n733 \n\n\n\nOdin same form of the horse-gallows appeared on the Tarot card of the \n\nHanged Man, whose number is twelve; he is the twelfth of the \n\nm ^^^ mi ^^ m ^^mm numbered Major Arcana or trump suit. Thus the Tarot Hanged Man \nrevealed Odin\'s secret of the Twelfth Rune, a mystery specifically \nmentioned in the Edda as a necromantic sign, with power to make a \nhanged man answer any question put to him. 9 This was one of the \nsources of the divinatory magic attributed to the pictures of the Tarot \ncards. It has been noted that the Hanged Man is a pagan figure, and \n"one of the clearest indications that the Tarot trumps were designed to \nillustrate some non-Christian system of belief." 10 The card of the \nHanged Man was followed by the card of Death, number 13, showing \nthat the victim like Odin was intended to traverse the nether worlds \nof the dead. \n\nScandinavian sacred kings were identified with Odin and suffered \nthe same kind of holy death, probably followed by apotheosis as was \nusual for sacrificial victims. Vikarr, legendary ancestor of the Vikings, \nwas killed by a spear-thrust from one of Odin\'s priests during such a \nceremony. Medieval Swedes periodically "reddened the earth with the \nblood of their lord," enacting the love-death of king and god. The \nblood Odin poured forth begot his reincarnation or son, Balder, the \nnorthern Adonis or Attis, whose consort had the same name as Attis\'s \nvirgin mother. She was Nanna or Nan, a Valkyrie name, probably \nderived from the archaic Middle-Eastern Moon-goddess Inanna. 11 \nBalder seems to have been the same dying-and-reborn god as Baal. \nBy the decree of his Heavenly Father, Balder too was slain and \nsent to the underground realm of the Goddess Hel. He was restored \nby the "tears of red gold" shed over him by Hel\'s celestial aspect, Freya; \nbut he would not return to this world. Balder\'s Second Coming \nwould take place in the next universe, after the destruction of the \ncurrent gods and the present world. He would rise again and establish \na new kingdom of more virtuous gods in another creation. 12 See \nDoomsday. \n\nPagan saviors like Odin-Balder were naturally regarded as demons \nby followers of their Christian rival. Therefore Odin became an \n"ogre" via his Lord-of-Death title Yggr, "Terrible One." n Medieval \nnecromancers were believed to use the things that belonged to Odin\'s \nrealm: gallows wood, gallows earth, parts of bodies of the hanged. At \nToulouse in 1335 a woman named Anne-Marie de Georgel was \naccused of witchcraft, on the charge of having used clothing, hair, nails, \nor fat of hanged criminals to make her magic ointments. 14 \n\nThough Odin was called All-father, he was not regarded as a \ncreator. Like his Greek counterpart Zeus, he was strictly limited in \npower. Both Odin and Zeus were helpless in the hands of the Fates wh \nwere Norns in Scandinavia and Moirai (Moerae) in Greece. "The \nancestresses of the Nornir were those beings who also gave rise to the \nGreek Moirai, the goddesses of Fate. According to Greek myth the \nMoirai were amongst the children of Night; and Night, as we know, was \n\n\n\n734 \n\n\n\n. \n\n\n\n3ne of the more ancient beings of Northern myth older at any rate Odor of Sanctity \n\n:han the viking god Odin." Nevertheless, Odin\'s worshippers eventually \n\ndivided him into a trinity named Twilight, Midnight, and Dawn, mm mm ^^^^^^^^ \n\n:opied from the trinitarian Mother Night to whom he was mated, just as \n\n:he Hindu Lord of Death became a trinity to mate with Triple Kali. 15 \n\nOdin was an Aryan god, descended from the Vedic lord of winds, \nvata, as shown by several other variations of his name: Voten, \nWuotan, Woden. 16 He was also Godan, in Hindu tradition a lord of \nvestern barbarians, consort of the Goddess Godiva whose name was \neally a redundant "Goddess-Goddess." \n\nAs a lord of winds, Odin was identified with the Prince of the \nPower of the Air, one of the titles of the Christian devil. Odin led the \nvVild Hunt, a nocturnal ceremony originally representing ghost-ridden \nitorm clouds galloping through the sky: another form of the Gray \nMorse that Odin rode. An English chronicle of 1 127 described the Wild \nHunt celebrated on the 6th of February by a group of black-clad \nlorsemen, riding black horses, following black hounds with "eyes like \nsaucers." Twenty or thirty men galloped through the woods between \nPeterborough and Stamford, "and all through the night the monks \nleard them sounding and winding their horns." 17 \n\nSometimes Odin appeared on earth as a one-eyed, gray-bearded \nbid wizard leaning on a staff, wearing either a hood or a broad- \nbrimmed witch-hat. 18 Odin\'s other common title was "the one-eyed \njjod," derived from several mythological sources including the an- \ncient metaphor for the penis. As a nonsexual explanation of the \ntnetaphor, one myth claimed that Odin gave up one of his eyes for \njhe privilege of drinking from the feminine Fount of Wisdom, called \neither Mimir (Mother of Memory) or Urdarbrunnr (Stream of Urd, \nLe., of the eldest Norn). Still another explanation for his acquisition of \nfeminine wisdom was that he stole the "wise blood" from the \npauldron Odrerir, which was in the keeping of the Earth-goddess in her \nacred uterine cave. 19 A similar story was told of the Aryan god Indra, \nvho stole the Great Mother\'s lunar blood Soma, and assumed the form \n!>f a bird to fly away with it to the home of the patriarchal gods. Both \nDdin and Indra were revered by men for having obtained formerly \nSorbidden secrets of magic and bestowed them on their favored \nhamans. \n\n1.0xenstiema,223. 2. Frazer,G.B.,412. 3.

This was \n\n\n\n735 \n\n\n\nOdor of Sanctity emphasized in legends of many saints\' relics, for example the remains \n\nof St. Mark allegedly discovered by some Venetian merchants in \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Alexandria during the 5th century. "When they lifted the stone from \nthe tomb, so strong a perfume spread throughout the city of Alexandria \nthat everybody wondered whence this sweet odor might come." \' \n\nAccording to the conventional phrase, every true saint died "in th \nodor of sanctity," for the sweet smell was taken as a symbolic \nassurance of undecaying immortality, tied to the church\'s doctrine of \nresurrection of the flesh. If a saint or martyr achieved heaven at once, \nas was the orthodox teaching, then his flesh could not decay and would \ntherefore smell as sweet as the airs of heaven, which were generally \nsupposed to be perfumed. \n\nThis was not an originally Christian notion. It was copied from \nEgyptian ritual and theory of mummification. A corpse must smell \nsweet in order to be accepted by the Egyptian deities; that was the \nreason for embalming mummies with sweet-smelling spices, resins, \nand aromatic oils. Anubis guarded the gates of the after-world and \nchecked each newcomer with his keen canine nose. If the scent was \nacceptable, Anubis declared the dead man reconciled to the gods by his \nOdor of Sanctity, and admitted him to the blessed realm. 2 \n\nThough the Christian Dark Age lost the art of mummification \nwhich was not to be revived until 20th-century embalmers improved \non it still the same spices were sometimes clumsily applied to dead \nbodies in an effort to preserve them. The precious virtue of frankin- \ncense was that it served as a key to heaven by counteracting "the ill \nsmells" of a corpse. 3 Churchmen claimed the bodies of those who \nwere excommunicated would not decompose, but they lacked the Odo \nof Sanctity that characterized saints. 4 \n\nThe perfume allegedly exuded by saints\' remains could work \nmiracles and cure diseases. The corpse of St. Stephen instantly \nhealed 70 sick men who smelled its odor when it was first exhumed. \nEarth from the grave of St. Dominic was said to smell sweet and \npossess miraculous powers. 5 \n\nAn effort was made to canonize the 1 3th-century inquisitor \nBernard de Caux with a legend of incorruptibility, because he was "a \npersecutor and hammer of heretics, a holy man . . . wonderful in extir- \npating heresy," Bernard Gui wrote. His body was exhumed 28 years \nafter his death and said to be perfectly fresh and sweet-smelling, except \nthat part of its nose was missing. 6 \n\nThe gypsies mocked Christian legends of nondecaying saints, \nclaiming that bodies which fail to undergo normal decomposition are \nnot holy spirits but vampires. 7 The church accepted stories about the \n"un-dead" but insisted on undecaying saints also. \n\nl.deVoragine,241. 2.

Oedipus killed his father/prede- ^^^^^^^^i \n\ncessor and married his mother/queen in the conventional way, but he \n\ncaused the Goddess\'s image (the Sphinx) to be thrown from a cliff and \n\nbroken. \n\nHis mother/queen was Jocasta or Iocaste, "Shining Moon," who \napparently called down the wrath of the Goddess on her consort. \nSome said he was banished from Thebes, others said he was slain by the \nGoddess\'s Furies in her sacred grove. 1 Most stories agree that he was \nblinded by a "clasp" taken from Jocasta\'s garment. \n\nJocasta\'s "clasp" may have been a euphemism for the castrating \nmoon-sickle. Herodotus said the women of Athens killed a man with \ntheir "clasps," but a new patriarchal law afterward forbade women to \nany such weapons. 2 Blindness was a common mythic symbol of \nastration, as shown by the tales of Samson, Odin, and Teiresias of \nThebes. In Egypt also, a penis was called an Eye; to cut it off was to \nput out the "light" of the One-Eyed God. ? \n\nThe allegedly incestuous marriage between Oedipus and his \nmother/queen was no more than the conventional alternation of \nsacred kings, each one chosen by the queen and declared the "son" or \nreincarnation of his slain predecessor. Oedipus\'s "father" bore the \nname of Laius, not a name at all but simply a title: "the king." As in an- \niquity every king was a god, so every queen was a Mother of God, \nmd the god\'s virgin bride as well. See Incest; Kingship. \n\n1 . Graves, G.M. 2, 10, 1 5, 396. 2. Herodotus, 303-4. 3.

(See Cannibalism.) \nAccording to the primitive tradition, worshippers were expected to \ntear apart the victim with bare hands and teeth, devouring him raw, as in \nthe earliest cults of Dionysus, Orpheus, Zagreus, and other gods torn \nto pieces in their myths. "The communicants rushed madly upon the \nsacrificial animal, tore it to pieces and ate it raw, believing that the \ngod was resident in the offering. ... It was believed that thus there took \nplace an identification with the god himself, together with a participa- \ntion in his substance and qualities." \' His immortality was eaten too \nboth in the omophagia and its descendant, the Christian sacrament of \ngod-eating though his body was no longer meat but a tiny fragment of \nbread. \n\n1. Angus, 129. \n\n\n\nOmphale \n\nLydian name of the Goddess of the Hub omphalos, the navel-stone \nmarking the center of the universal womb. Greek myth describes her as \na queen of Lydia, who enslaved Heracles and set him to work at her \nspinning wheel. Heracles was the sun, and he performed his twelve \nLabors on the spinning wheel of the zodiac. Each "labor" was really \none of the zodiacal houses through which the sun passed during \nHeracles\'s one-year servitude in Omphale\'s palace. This year marked \nbis reign as the Aeon. He wore the queen\'s robes, in memory of which \nthe priests of Heracles wore female garments and pretended to \ncommand feminine powers of magic. It was characteristic of transitional \n\n\n\n739 \n\n\n\nOmphalos periods between matriarchy and patriarchy that the king wore the \n\nqueen\'s robes when acting as her deputy. 1 \n\n^^^^^^^^^__ Omphale represented the Goddess as a consumer of sun-kings, \n\neach one annually killed and replaced by another who was born at the \nwinter solstice; like the archaic Roman Goddess Anna Perenna she was \na Mother of Time. 2 One of her consorts before Heracles was the oak- \ngod Tmolus, who fathered his own reincarnation, the sacred king \nTantalus, cermonially drowned at the Oschophoria to represent the \nsun sinking into the sea. ? Tmolus as a human victim was wreathed in \nthe oak garland of the god and tossed by a bull onto sharp stakes, \nindicating that the Goddess\'s bull-masked priests impaled him in a pit \nwhere his blood could fertilize the ground. \n\nThe divine Father of Heracles-the-Savior was the sun god Apollo, \nthought to have originated in Lydia although he later became one of \nthe most typically Greek of gods. In his earliest forms, Apollo was \nsubject to the rule of his sister-bride Artemis, the Moon, who was \nsometimes incarnate in a sacred navel-stone and therefore bore the title \nof Omphale. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 2, 167. 2. Herodotus, 5-6. 3. Graves, GM. 2, 29. \n\n\n\nOmphalos \n\nGreek transliteration of Latin umbilicus, the navel or hub of the \nworld, center of the Goddess\'s body, source of all things. As every \nancient nation regarded its own version of the Great Mother as the \ncosmic spirit, so its own capital or chief temple was located at the center \nof the earth, marked by the stone omphalos that concentrated the \nMother\'s essence. Hebrews called it the beth-elox "dwelling place of \ndeity." As a male god, incarnate in the king, this deity was always \nlocated at the Goddess\'s middle because he was her child. \n\nIn 710 B.C. a king of Susa said, "The Susian land, which is the first \nof the earth, is in the center of all mankind." Iranians said, "The \ncountry of Iran is better than all other places, for it is in the middle." \nChina called itself "the Middle Kingdom." So did Scandinavia, \nknown to its inhabitants as Middle-Earth (Midgard). Old Japanese \npoems called Japan the Middle Kingdom of Earth. Romans called \nthe sea at the center of their empire mare nostrum, "our sea," and gave \nit the name of Mediterranean, literally Middle-of-the-Earth. 1 \n\nRomans placed the world\'s navel or omphalos at the round hearth \nof the temple of Vesta. Greeks placed it at the omphalos of Delphi, \n"Temple of the Womb." Jews placed it at the temple of Zion. \nChristianity inherited a Jewish cosmogony wherein Jerusalem was \nregarded as the center of the earth, where Jesus died on the identical \nspot where the Tree of Life once grew in the primal garden. It was \nsaid a spear standing upright at the tomb of Christ would cast no shadow \nat midday, because it marked the center point of everything under \n\n\n\n740 \n\n\n\n|the sun. When Pope Urban preached the first crusade at Clermont, he Onuphris, Saint \n\ndeclared "infallibly" that "Jerusalem is the middle point of the Ophion \n\nHearth." 2 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nBy pre-Christian reckoning, this middle point was the Virgin Zion, \nfor the yonic temple of Mari-Anat. Feminine symbolism was preva- \nlent in all omphalic shrines, which generally represented the body of the \n; Goddess with the God present as a sexual partner a phallic serpent, \ntree, cross, or sacrificed male bleeding the Blood of Life. Even medieval \nromances spoke of the Palace of Love where God and Goddess \n(joined in medio mundi, at the center of the world. It was equipped with \njthe usual sexual symbols: a sacred spring in the garden, which also \ni contained the Tree of Life. 5 \n\nChristian theologians were amply supplied with the kind of hubris \n[that made men call their own home place the center of the earth, \ntheir own lifetimes the ultimate end of time, their own religion the only \n(permissible one, and their own selves the focal point of the cosmic \n|drama of good and evil. Indeed, the whole universe was viewed as a \nmere backdrop for man\'s probation. Peter Lombard said, "Just as \njman is made for the sake of God that is, that he may serve Him so \nthe universe is made for the sake of man that is, that it may serve \nhim; therefore is man placed at the middle point of the universe." 4 If \nman couldn\'t think of himself as somehow vitally connected with the \n\\omphalos, his world-view was threatened. Such a threat underlay the \nchurch\'s opposition to the discoveries of Galileo, which tended to \nprove that the earth was not the center of God\'s universe. \n\n1. Lethaby, 73. 2. White 1, 99. 3.

Her secret rites were forbidden to men; but on \nher December festival, the Opalia, there was a general ceremony \ninvolving sexual orgies and touching the earth. 1 The powers of Jupiter \nwere believed ineffective unless he was united with her, as Jove \nOpulentia. 2 Like Pluto, he became Lord of Abundance, or Lord of \nRiches. Macrobius said the secret name of Rome was Ops Consivia. \n\nSacred gem of the Opalia was the opal, representing the Goddess\': \nmany-colored veils. Because of its feminine connotation, Christians \ndeclared it an unlucky stone. As a witch charm it was said to blind \nprying eyes and make its bearer invisible. 3 Arab alchemists identified \nit with the Philosopher\'s Stone, because the latter was believed to \ncontain all basic colors red, blue, yellow, green, and white. 4 \n\n1.

The Furies maintained that no crime is \nworse than killing the mother whose "intimate blood" made one\'s \nown life.

The further back one \ngoes the less possible it is to distinguish between the erotic and the \nsacral. And \'the further back\' means not only in time, but also into \nthe depths of experience." 2 \n\nOur "holiday" derives from the Holi festivals of the east, described \nby a pious western observer as a Saturnalia, featuring "the most \nlicentious debauchery." 3 The participants invariably saw their "de- \nbauchery" as a holy act, redolent of blessedness. Hindu texts said, \n"To have carnal intercourse with the goddess Parvati is a virtue which \ndestroys all sin." 4 The I Ching speaks of the mystical value of sexual \nintercourse, which "gives life to all things." 5 According to Iwan Bloch, \n"Religion shares with the sexual impulse the unceasing yearning, the \nsentiment of everlastingness, the mystic absorption into the depths of \nlife, the longing for the coalescence of individualities in an eternally \nblessed union." 6 For such reasons, words like passion, bliss, trance, \necstasy, glory were interchangeably applied to religious and sexual \nexperience. \n\nClassical paganism used sexual orgia to represent the central \nMystery, which is why Christian ascetics condemned the Great Rite \nas "the unnameable rites of the mysteries" or "the whoredoms of \nEleusis." The Goddess promised eternal life to those who "privily \nentered the bedchamber," meaning the pastos or bridal chamber where \nthe hieros gamos between the Goddess and her worshipper was \nconsummated. 7 The same sort of orgia took place among the northern \nbarbarians. Strabo said the druid enchanters in Ireland practiced \nsexual worship "similar to the orgies of Samothrace." 8 \n\nDespite the extreme asceticism of its early centuries, Christianity \ntoo became an orgiastic religion in some of its manifestations. An \n1 lth-century Christian community at Orleans met on certain nights of \nthe year to indulge in promiscuous behavior. A contemporary ac- \ncount said when the lights were put out, "every man grabs whatever \nwoman comes to hand, even though she may be his own mother, his \nsister, or a nun, without thought of sin; for such tumbling is regarded by \nthem as holiness and religion." 9 Defining such behavior as a manifes- \ntation of devil-worship was not very effective in preventing it, however. \nCommunal mating was a standard accompaniment to religious cere- \nmonies the world over, since before any Bibles were written. It was part \nof the surge of group feeling often characterizing the religious \nexperience. The medieval peasant had long been familiar with the \nphenomenon, and liked it well enough to cling to it even if it was \ncalled Satanism. 10 \n\nFew orgiasts deliberately viewed themselves as devil worshippers. \nAs a rule they thought themselves exceptionally holy. Rasputin\'s sect, \nthe "Men of God,"claimed their naked dances imitated those of the \nheavenly angels. After singing and dancing to induce an ecstatic state, \n\n\n\nOrgy \n\n\n\nIwan Bloch Author \nof The Sexual Life of \nOur Times; \ncontemporary of \nHavelock Ellis. \n\n\n\nStrabo Greek traveler, \ngeographer, and \nhistorian of the first \ncentury B.C., a follower \nof the Stoic faith. \n\n\n\n743 \n\n\n\nOriant they engaged in sexual orgies which sometimes resulted in the birth of \n\nOimazd children, all of whom were said to have been begotten by the Holy \n\n^^^^^^_ Ghost. 11 \n\nA Methodist preacher in Indiana once said, "Religious passion \nincludes all other passions: you cannot excite one without stirring up \nthe others." 12 American revivalism certainly proved this, so consistent!\' \nthat any child born nine months after a revivalist meeting was \ngenerally known as a "camp-meeting child." Outwardly puritanical, \nAmerican Protestantism nevertheless "revived" a mode of religious \nbehavior that would have been perfectly familiar to the ancient Greeks \nwith their Samothracian orgies and their lecherous satyrs. 15 It just \nwasn\'t called by its real name. \n\n1.

Jonas, 217. \n\n\n\nOrpheus \n\nOrphism was one of the most popular mystery-religions of the early \nChristian era. It was a development of the cult of Dionysus together \nwith Orpheus, his earthly prophet and savior-son. \n\nOrphism introduced a theology of redemption. It taught a doctrine of \noriginal sin. Man s nature was dualistic, composed of the titanic \nelements closely associated with the body, and the dionysiac elements \nwhich were allied with the soul. By an ascetic morality the former must \nbe repressed and the latter cultivated, to the end that the soul may escape \nfrom the body as from a tomb, and may cease to be subject to the weary \nkyklos genesios, "cycle of reincarnation. " "I have flown out of the \nsorrowful wheel, "says the Orphic initiate on the Compagno tablet. . . . \nOn the Dionysiac type of Greek religion it laid hold and remodelled it to \nits purpose. This Dionysiac religion, like Orphism, was of northern \nThracian provenance, and was fraught with orgiastic-mystic elements, on \nwhich Orphism fastened, adopting its emotionalism, its doctrine of \nEnthousiasmos, and of possession by the deity, rejecting its wild frenzy, \nand transforming its savage ritual into a sacramental religion. \' \n\nOrphism was a kind of western Buddhism, with escape from the \nkarmic wheel effected by ascetic contemplation, spiritual journeys of the \nastral-projection type, and elaborate revelations. "Orphism was \nsteeped in sacramentalism, which flooded the later Mysteries and flowed \ninto Christianity. Salvation was by sacrament, by initiatory rites, and \nby an esoteric doctrine. . . . Orphism was the most potent solvent ever \nintroduced into Greek religious life. . . . [T]he Orphics sowed the \nseeds of distrust toward the national and hereditary principle in religion, \nand made the salvation of the individual soul of first importance. In \nthis way Orphism had enormous influence upon the subsequent history \nof religion." 2 \n\nOrphism was the principal vehicle for Oriental mysticism in \nGreece. Its teachings were those of mystics everywhere: "Grasping in \nyour mind that nothing is impossible for you, consider yourself immortal \nand capable of understanding everything. . . . Ascend beyond all \nheight, descend beyond all depth. Gather into yourself the sensations of \ncreation, of fire and of water, of dryness and of humidity, imagining \nthat you are at one and the same moment everywhere, on earth, in the \nsea, in the heaven, that you have not yet been born, that you are \nbeyond death." Like an initiated yogi, the Orphic sage could repeat: "I \nrepresent things to myself, not by the sight of my eyes, but by the \n\n\n\n745 \n\n\n\nOrpheus spiritual energy I draw from the Powers. I am in heaven, in earth, in \n\nwater. I am in air, in animals, in plants, in the womb, before the \n^^_ ^ -- mam IMB womb, after the womb, everywhere." 3 \n\nAn Orphic funerary tablet dug up near Sybaris alluded to Buddha- \nlike escape from the karmic wheel (kyklos genesion, cycles of \nbecoming), essentially identical to the Oriental sangsara. \n\nAn Orphic sacramental bowl of gold, with carved figures, dating \nfrom the 5th century, was unearthed in Romania in 1837. The \nfigures showed the Orphic initiate\'s death-and-rebirth journey, the \ndeities to be met in the upper and nether worlds, who also appeared \nin person as masked temple personnel when the novice was led through \nthe stages of initiation. These figures were arranged on the bowl in \nthe same way as the deities of the Intermediate State, between death \nand rebirth, were arranged on mandalas of Tibetan holy books. 4 \n\nIn Orphic belief as in the Orient, the power behind all forces of \nmanifestation was the Great Mother, whose free-standing image \nappeared in the center of the Orphic bowl with other goddesses and \ngods ranged around her in the formation of a wheel. 5 She was the \nBlack Mother Night, from whom were born Sleep, Love, Dreams, the \nFates, Nemesis, Old Age, and Death. Even Zeus feared her, "which \nmay reflect an old belief in Night as one of the great primeval powers of \nthe universe." 6 \n\nMother Night was equated with Persephone, the "Destroyer" \nlinked with both Dionysus and Orpheus. Once initiated, the Orphic \nmystic could announce: "I have sunk beneath the bosom of Persepho- \nne, Queen of the Underworld." Upon his post-mortem descent into \nhell, Persephone would personally greet him and promise to make him \n"god instead of mortal." 7 \n\nThe Descent Into Hades was the title of the Orphic manual and \nthe essential rite of Orphic initiation, because the god himself \ndescended into hell and returned, bringing with him the revelation on \nwhich the Mysteries were founded. 8 According to the classic myth, \nOrpheus descended to retrieve his bride Eurydice, who had died after \nbeing bitten by a snake in the grass. This was a late revision of a \nprimitive Thracian dying-god myth, onto which the doctrines of Orph- \nism were grafted later. Eurydice was actually "Universal Dike," or \nTyche, Goddess of Fate, lady of the karmic wheel. She was originally \none of Demeter\'s matriarchal Furies, converted by Hellenic writers \ninto a daughter of Zeus. 9 In the underworld she was herself Persepho- \nne, the Death-goddess; and her "snake in the grass" was her own \ntotem. \n\nThe oldest Orphic myth said Orpheus was torn to pieces by the \nMaenads, who worshipped Dionysus, Orpheus\'s divine alter ego. \nMythographers gave various excuses for the Maenads\' act, designed to \nconceal the true sacrificial motive. Some said the Maenads killed \n\n\n\n746 \n\n\n\nDrpheus because he denounced their sexual orgies and advocated male Orpheus \n\nlomosexual love instead of the heterosexual kind. The Maenads \n\nyere so angry at Orpheus that in Macedonia they killed all their ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nlusbands for listening to his teachings. It has been suggested that \n\njatriarchal-ascetic ideas came to Orphism from Egyptian priests of Ra, \n\n>ecause Orphic priests wore Egyptian dress. 10 \n\nOther stories said Orpheus was killed not by the Maenads but by \nZeus\'s lightning bolt as punishment for his revelation of the gods\' \niecrets to mankind. After he descended into hell and returned, his \ndisembodied head was laid in a cave sacred to Dionysus, where it \ncontinued to sing and speak, like the head of Osiris at Abydos. As a \neacher of the mysteries of the after-life, Orpheus became a god of \njracles. He was said to have founded the oracles of Hecate in Aegina \nmd of Demeter Chthonia in Sparta, two examples of Hellenic \nsyncretism, as these oracles were formerly the property of the God- \ndesses whose names they bore. 11 Some derived Orpheus\'s name from \nJrphi, a popular oracular shrine in Edessa, though others linked his \nlame with Erebus, the land of the dead. 12 Aristotle insisted that \nDrpheus had never lived at all. 13 \n\nThe common legend said Orpheus was a famous poet and lyre- \n)layer, like Cinyras the ancestor of Adonis (Greek cinyra, "lyre," \n:ognate with Semitic kinnor, "lyre") and like David the ancestor of \nesus. Orpheus\'s lyre was kept as a holy relic in the temple at Lesbos, \nintouchable and taboo. Neanthus, son of the Tyrant of Lesbos, once \njlayed the Orphic lyre and shortly afterward was torn to pieces by a \n>ack of "dogs," which might have meant dog-masked Maenad-pries- \nesses. Later, the lyre was set in the stars, where it still appears as the \n:onstellation Lyra. 14 \n\nOne of the mysteriously significant phrases of Orphic initiation was \n\'I a kid have fallen into my mother\'s milk," possibly a reference to \nieath under Persephone\'s bosom followed by rebirth as her nursling. \n\\n ancient ritual was involved, one that was specifically forbidden by \newish laws: "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother\'s milk" (Exodus \n3:19). So great was the Jews\' fear of this ceremony that they even \nnsisted on using different sets of dishes for milk and meat products. Yet \nheir god was once mated to Mother Asherah as the "Pit," like \n\'ersephone, in a sacred-marriage rite that included cooking a kid in its \nnother\'s milk. 15 No one now knows what the phrase meant to \njiblical writers. Certainly the prohibition was not motivated by kindness \no animals or reverence for goat-motherhood; there was a mystical \nreason for it. \n\nOrphism became one of the most serious rivals of Christianity in \n:he first few centuries a.d., until the church devised ways to identify \n:he Orphic savior with Christ. Fourth-century Christian art showed \nChrist in the guise of Orpheus, wearing a Phrygian cap, playing the \n\n\n\n747 \n\n\n\nOsculum Infame lyre, a sacrificial lamb under his foot. 16 Alexander Severus kept holy \n\nOsiris images of Christ and Orpheus side by side in his private chapel. 17 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ The Orphic Gospel was preached throughout the Mediterranear \n\nworld for at least twelve centuries. 18 It contributed much to Christian \ntheology, and even reappeared in medieval bardic romance. The poets \ntransformed Orpheus into Sir Orfeo, a king of England, son of King \nPluto and the Goddess Juno. Orfeo\'s wife was Heurodis (Eurydice). \nentered the underworld through a rocky cleft, and found the pagan \nfairyland of groves and gardens surrounding the queen\'s crystal palace, \nwith its pillars of gold and gems. The place was inhabited by "people \nsupposed to be dead, but they were not so." Orfeo returned to his \ncapital city, Winchester, which "used to be called Thrace" or so \nthe bard said. 19 So much for medieval notions of geography. \n\nOrphism gave Christian Europe more than muddled geography \nand romantic legends, however. The Orphic revelation was virtually \nindistinguishable from the Christian one, especially in its later "puri- \nfied" form among ascetics who abstained from meat and from sensual \npleasures in order to win eternal blessedness. With the introduction of \nsystem of post-mortem punishment, the resemblance to Christianity \nwas striking. Adeimantos, a character in Plato\'s Republic, said the \nOrphic revelation was "misused" by unscrupulous teachers, who \n"hold out the bribe of a happy immortality to the good and threaten \neternal punishment to the bad, so that men turn to goodness not for \nits own sake, but in fear." 20 The difficulty was not restricted to Orphisi \n(see Hell). \n\n1.

Scatological fantasies and excrement often figured in \nchurchmen\'s visions of the activities of witches. \n\n\n\nOsiris \n\nOf all savior-gods worshipped at the beginning of the Christian era, \nOsiris may have contributed more details to the evolving Christ figure \nthan any other. Already very old in Egypt, Osiris was identified with \n\n\n\n748 \n\n\n\niarly every other Egyptian god and was on the way to absorbing them Osiris \n\n||. He had well over 200 divine names. 1 He was called Lord of \n\n|ords, King of Kings, God of Gods. 2 He was the Resurrection and the ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nife, the Good Shepherd, Eternity and Everlastingness, the god who \n\njnade men and women to be born again." Budge says, "From first to \n\nst, Osiris was to the Egyptians the god-man who suffered, and died, \n\njid rose again, and reigned eternally in heaven. They believed that they \n\njould inherit eternal life, just as he had done." 5 \n\nAccording to Egyptian scriptures, "As truly as Osiris lives, so truly \ntall his follower live; as truly as Osiris is not dead he shall die no \n!ore; as truly as Osiris is not annihilated he shall not be annihilated." 4 \n\nOsiris\'s coming was announced by Three Wise Men: the three \nars Mintaka, Anilam, and Alnitak in the belt of Orion, which point \n;rectly to Osiris\'s star in the east, Sirius (Sothis), significator of his birth, \n\'ngelic voices hailed the coming of the Universal Lord on this \nxasion, which marked the rising of the Nile flood. Oriental paths of \nle Osirian "tradition may be traced in Tibet, where the rising of the \n.me star in the east marks the annual festival of "setting free the waters \n"springs," as the Egyptian festival set free the waters of the Nile, \n\'ibetans named the star Rishi-Agastya, after a holy king of "a very \njicient time." 5 Ancient Hebrews called the same star Ephraim, or \nle Star of Jacob. In Syrian, Arabian, and Persian astrology it was \nlessaeil the Messiah. 6 \n\nCertainly Osiris was a prototypical Messiah, as well as a devoured \nlost. His flesh was eaten in the form of communion cakes of wheat, \nfce "plant of Truth." Osiris was Truth, and those who ate him became \n[ruth also, each of them another Osiris, a Son of God, a "Light-god, \ndweller in the Light-god." Egyptians came to believe that no god \nKcept Osiris could bestow eternal life on mortals. 7 He alone was the \njavior, Un-nefer, the "Good One." Under this title he was even \nmonized as a Christian saint. 8 \n\nEgyptians were much afraid of death\'s corruption awaiting them \nithout the kindly intervention of Osiris: "When the soul hath \nsparted, a man seeth corruption, and the bones of his body crumble \nvay and become stinking things, and the members decay one after \nle other, the bones crumble into a helpless mass, and the flesh turneth \nito fetid liquid. Thus a man becometh a brother unto the decay \nhich cometh upon him, and he turneth into a myriad of worms, and \ne becometh nothing but worms, and an end is made of him, and he \nisheth in the sight of the god of day." 9 But Osiris could prevent all \nnastiness: \n\nHomage to thee, O my divine father Osiris, thou hast thy being with thy \nmembers. Thou didst not decay, thou didst not become worms, thou \ndidst not diminish, thou didst not become corruption, thou didst not \n\nputrefy, and thou didst not turn into worms I shall not decay, and I \n\nshall not rot, I shall not putrefy, I shall not turn into worms, and I shall not \n\n\n\n749 \n\n\n\nOsiris see corruption before the eye of the god Shu. I shall have my being, I \n\nshall have my being; I shall live, I shall live; I shall germinate, I shall \n\n^^^ germinate, I shall germinate; I shall wake up in peace; I shall not \n\nputrefy, my intestines shall not perish; I shall not surfer injury; mine eye j \nshall not decay; the form of my visage shall not disappear. . . . My body \nshall be stablished, and it shall neither fall into ruin nor be destroyed on I \nthis earth. 10 \n\nThe cult of Osiris contributed a number of ideas and phrases to \nthe Bible. The 23 rd Psalm copied an Egyptian text appealing to Osiris \nthe Good Shepherd to lead the deceased to the "green pastures" and \n"still waters" of the ne/er-ne/erland, to restore the soul to the body, an \nto give protection in the valley of the shadow of death (the Tuat). \nThe Lord\'s Prayer was prefigured by an Egyptian hymn to Osiris-Ame \nbeginning "O Amen, Amen, who art in heaven." 11 Amen was also \ninvoked at the end of every prayer. \n\nJesus\'s words, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and \ndie, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit" (John \n12:24), were taken from an Osirian doctrine that a dying man is like a \ncorn of wheat "which falls into the earth in order to draw from its \nbosom a new life." 12 Jesus\'s words, "In my Father\'s house are many \nmansions" (John 14:2) came from an Osirian text telling of numer- \nous Arits ("Mansions") in the blessed land of Father Osiris. 13 Stories \nabout Osiris turned up in Christian legends. Jesus\'s healing of a \nnobleman\'s daughter was based on a tale of an Osirian priest who curec \na princess. 14 Worshippers of Osiris were promised that they would \nrule the spirit-souls (angels) in heaven, foreshadowing St. Paul\'s promis \nto his followers that they would rule even angels (1 Corinthians 6:3). \nThe bishop\'s crozier was the Osirian shepherd-crook. The Christian \ncross itself was a variant of the Egyptian ankh, symbolizing "the Life \nto Come." 15 \n\nOne significant difference between Osiris and Christ was that \nOsiris was restored to life not by his divine father but by his divine \nmother who was also his bride, Isis. She put his dismembered body \nback together and raised him from the dead. She married him and \nconceived his reincarnation, the Divine Child Horus who became \nOsiris again. She also took him to heaven where he reigned as Father \nRa. Sometimes Ra was called Osiris\'s father, sometimes Osiris was \ncalled Ra\'s father, sometimes they were the same god, named Osiris- , \nRa. They were cyclically reincarnated as father-son and son-father, \ndwelling in the Mother as fetus, lover, corpse. 16 \n\nThus Osiris\'s cult centered on the theme of divine incest, apparen \nalso in a Christianity that declared the Father and Son identical, and \nthe Mother of God the same individual as God\'s bride. Osiris plainly \nexpressed the archetypal wish for union with the mother, found in all \nmen\'s religions. He was restored to life as the ithyphallic Min, Men, or \nMenu, "Moon-god," hailed as a Bull of lust, "the mummy with a \nlong member," or "the Lord Who impregnates his Mother." 17 \n\n\n\n750 \n\n\n\nA symbol of Osiris\'s sacred marriage was the menat, "moon- Osiris \n\nharm," in hieroglyphics a phallus-shaped jar pouring fluid into a \n\nvider pot or vase, signifying sexual intercourse with a deity. 18 The Haaa ^ MHH ^ HH \n\nmenat amulet was borne by nearly every Egyptian god; it was also a \njitle of Isis. 19 The same sexual image of the two vessels was found in the \n;ombs and temples of Babylon and Assyria. 20 The male water-jar \n\nresented the seminal spirit of the Savior in all the lands of the Middle \nplast and Egypt. In his processions, the god was preceded by a jar- \nbearer like the man with a jar of water who preceded Jesus in the \nPassover procession (Luke 22:10). \n\nThe Jews\' Passover meal called Seder may have descended from \nthe Egyptian Sed, the oldest festival of Osirian regeneration and \nfertility. 21 At the Sed, Osiris\'s masculinity was erected in the form of the \nDjed column, originally a simple phallic obelisk, later a representation \npf Osiris\'s sacrum, the "sacred bone" so called because it was once \nregarded as the source of seminal fluid. When Isis brought Osiris \npack to life, her first care was to make him "stand up," which meant \nrestoration of his phallic spirit. 22 \n\nPrimitive elements in Osirian myth show its extreme antiquity, \nBating back to Neolithic Egypt. Before re-conceiving Osiris, the \nGoddess apparently devoured him as she hovered over his corpse in the \nbuise of the archaic Vulture-mother (see Vulture). 2 * Like similar \nimages of devouring Kali, this points to an age predating even the \ndiscovery of fatherhood, when reincarnations were believed to be \nbrought about by cannibalism. Indeed, Osiris may have begun as one of \nthe numerous forms of Shiva, for his name came from Ausar or Asar, \nmeaning "the Asian" just like the Aesir or "Asian" gods of northern \nEurope. 24 \n\nAbout 4000 years ago, Osiris\'s cult was established at Abydos, \n|where he was called Osiris Khenti-Amenti, Lord of Death or Lord of \nme Westerners, meaning those who had "gone west" into death\'s \nsunset land. He was incarnate in a succession of sacred kings who \nseem to have served as sacrificial victims. Their bodies were divided up \nbnd distributed to different parts of the country to assist fertility as in \nNorway, up to the 9th century, where kings\' bodies used to be quartered \nand sent to the four provinces for burial, so each locality would have \nroyal flesh to assist the crops. 25 As Christian churches used to be \nfounded on spurious relics of apostles and saints, so Egyptian temples \nwere founded on bits of Osiris\'s body. 26 \n\nLike the head of Orpheus on Lesbos, the head of Osiris was \npreserved in the temple at Abydos to serve as an oracle, providing \n|much of the Egyptians\' detailed knowledge of the after-world. The \nshrine had a sacred well called Peq or Pega, the original home of the \nPega-nymphs who guarded the oracular well of Pirene in Corinth. 27 \nLike Christians seeking burial in consecrated ground by a church, \nwealthy Egyptians bought burial space near the Osirian temple, so as to \nshare the god\'s resurrection. Abydos therefore became the center of a \n\n\n\n751 \n\n\n\nOsiris great necropolis. 28 The faithful claimed on their epitaphs that "I have \n\nbecome a divine being by the side of the birthchamber of Osiris; I am \n^^^^^^^^^^^ brought forth with him, I renew my youth." 29 \n\nWhen human sacrifices were replaced by animals, Osiris obligingly \nincarnated himself in a variety of beasts, notably the Apis bull who \nascended to glory, carrying away the sins of all Egypt as he died in \natonement. 30 Osiris-Apis later became the composite deity Sarapis, \nmonotheistic god of Alexandria for six centuries. 31 \n\nThere were several Osirian trinities. One consisted of Osiris the \nfather, Isis the mother, and Horus the son. Another was Ra the father, \nOsiris the son on earth, and Horus the son rising in heaven. Another \nwas (1) Ptah, "Opener of the Way," a phallic consort of the Virgin and \nthe opener of her matrix; (2) Seker, representing the male spent, \ndead, and hidden within the female tomb-womb; and (3) Osiris, newly \nincarnate as the Min-phallus and standing for resurrection. 32 \n\nThe sacred lunar numbers seven, fourteen, and twenty-eight were \nprominent in Osiris\'s cult. The lunar cycle of twenty-eight days \ncorresponded to his descent into the underworld and ascent to heaven: \nfourteen days each way, or fourteen steps on his mystic Ladder. \nBuddha\'s ladder of descent to earth and return to heaven also had \nfourteen steps. 33 Like Buddha and Osiris, the Tibetan sage is still \nsupposed to pass fourteen days in the after-world before encountering \nenlightenment in the form of "the mandala of the animal-headed \ndeities," reminiscent of the Egyptian gods. Some of these deities were \nnamed Heruka, a possible cognate of Osiris the sun, Heru-Harakhti. 34 \n\nLike Hindu sacred dramas, the cycle of Osirian drama seems to \nhave been keyed to the menstrual cycle of the Goddess, incarnate in \nthe priestess who bore the title of Divine Mother. In the month of \nAthyr (Hathor), Egyptian women made clay phalli as images of Osiris \nand threw them into the Nile when it "turned to blood" in flood time \n(see Moses). 35 This custom recalled the Oriental conviction that the \nGoddess must be menstruating at the time of her sacred marriage to the \ndying god. Later accounts explained Osirian lunar numbers by saying \nhe was 28 years old at the time of his passion, or else that it took place in \nthe 28th year of his reign on earth. 36 \n\nAs Lord of Death, Osiris was sometimes identified with the Great \nSerpent of the underworld, and sometimes painted in the same \nserpentine form, bent around so his toes touched his head. 37 In \nPtolemaic times the whole underworld became Osiris\'s province, its \nseven halls collectively called the House of Osiris. 38 \n\nBetween 1450 and 1400 B.C. the Osirian mystery-cult took form, \nwith hundreds of verbal formulae for making the worshipper become \nan Osiris. He would be born of Isis and nursed by Nephthys. He would \nride across the sky "side by side with the gods of the stars." He would \nbe as virile as Osiris-Menu: "My palm tree (penis) standeth upright and \nis like Menu Therefore the Phallus of Ra, which is the head of \n\n\n\n752 \n\n\n\njsiris, shall not be swallowed up." When he was in heaven, the gods \njemselves would bring offerings to him. 59 \n\nThe Osirian Mysteries taught words of power for bringing about \n|ese desirable effects. Such words of power were "keys" to heaven, \n! be concealed from non-initiates as "a great mystery." 40 The Saite \niecension said with such keys, a soul could pass freely through the \nhtes, gatekeepers, guardians, heralds, inspectors, and other spirits of the \nl;avenly mansions, for he would know all their names. \n\nAnd the Majesty ofAnpu shall say unto me, "Knowest thou the name of \nthis door, and canst thou tell it? " ... And the Majesty of the god Anpu \nshall say unto me, "Knowest thou the name of the upper leaf, and the \nname of the lower leaf?" On receiving the proper answers, the Majesty \nof the god Anpu shall say, "Pass on, for thou hast knowledge, O Osiris. " 4I \n\nDuring the first century B.C. the Osirian religion was established \nii all parts of the Roman Empire. 42 Its popularity declined in the end \necause it became too complicated for the average mind. Necessary \nwords of power" developed into lengthy catechisms of divine names of \noorposts, lintels, bolts, panels, doorkeepers, spirits of the hour, \niiresholds, gods\' right and left feet, etc. Egyptians invented even a \nnemory-god to bring back the spells and holy names if they were \niolen by a spirit of forgetfulness. 43 The important ceremony of "Open- \nfig the Mouth" was performed to let the dead person speak charms \nnd words of power freely. 44 Still, the catechisms became too long and \njomplex to be remembered. \n\nBudge remarks that the Egyptians believed in "the resurrection of \nlie body in a changed and glorified form, which would live to all \nternity in the company of the spirits and souls of the righteous in a \ningdom ruled by a being who was of divine origin, but who had lived \npon the earth, and had suffered a cruel death at the hands of his \nInemies, and had risen from the dead, and had become the God and \n\ning of the world which is beyond the grave Although they believed \n\n,i all these things and proclaimed their belief with almost passionate \narnestness, they seem never to have freed themselves from a hankering \nfter amulets and talismans, and magical names, and words of power, \nnd seem to have trusted in these to save their souls and bodies, both liv- \nng and dead, with something of the same confidence which they \nilaced in the death and resurrection of Osiris. A matter for surprise is \nhat they seem to see nothing incongruous in such a mixture of magic \n[nd religion." 45 \n\nIt is a matter for even more surprise that a scholar of Budge\'s \n|tature failed to see exactly the same mixture of magic and religion in \nhristianity; for indeed he could have been talking about Christians as \n(veil as Egyptians. To this day, simple Christian folk still display the \nlame hankering after crucifixes and medals, agnus del, incantations, \nvocations of holy names and other formulae, saints\' relics, holy \n\n\n\nOsiris \n\n\n\nSaite Recension A \n\nportion of the \nEgyptian Book of the \nDead in vogue from \nthe XXVI dynasty to \nthe Ptolemaic period, \nca. 600-30 B.C. \n\n\n\n" \n\n\n\n753 \n\n\n\nOuroboros water, images, even rosaries which they copied from the Egyptians. \n\nOwl Christian formulae of exorcism, baptism, extreme unction, absolu- \n\n^^^^_^^^^^_ tion, etc., were words of power under different names. The notion of \nresurrection through identification with a resurrected god (by eating \nhis flesh) was in itself magical rather than religious and this was the \nbasis of the Christian salvation-idea no less than for that of Osiris\'s \nvotaries. Moreover it seems the concept of Christ was no less syncretic \nthan the concept of Osiris. If anything, the older god had more right \nto claim an original system of worship or of superstition, depending on \none\'s point of view. \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 2, 178. 2.

See Trinity. \n\nAccording the Christian legend, the owl was one of "three \ndisobedient sisters" who defied God and was transformed into a bird \nwho never looked at the sun. 3 It is easy enough to see in this idea the \nshape of the Goddess herself, and the church\'s hostility to her. One \nof the medieval names for the owl was "night hag"; it was said to be a \nwitch in bird form. 4 The owl is still associated with witches in the \nsymbols of Halloween. \n\nThe owl is also a bird of wisdom because it used to embody the \n\n\n\n754 \n\n\n\n/isdom of the Goddess.

If an owl could be slain and its heart pulled out and laid on \nne left breast of a sleeping woman, the woman would talk in her sleep \nnd reveal all her secrets. 5 This seems to have been a basis of the \nxpression, "heart-to-heart talk," which meant a woman\'s secret conver- \nation with her familiar. \n\n1.

"It has now been demonstrated that the hostility of the \npeasantry to Christianity gave the meaning of \'pagan\' to paganus. \nThis seems to date from the first half of the fourth century and it \ngradually becomes general in the second half." 1 \n\n"Heathen" came from Germanic heiden, that which is hidden, \nbecause the church officially forbade the rites of the old deities, and \nthe pagan people continued their rites in secret. 2 \n\nThrough the first half of the Christian era, paganism was overt and \nmore or less acceptable. Christianity and paganism existed side by \nside in uneasy proximity long enough for Christians to take over as \nmany pagan deities, holy places, customs, and holidays as possible. \nNoting that the people wouldn\'t accept Christianity unless it could be \nconsidered an extension of their paganism, Pope Gregory the Great \ndirected that Christian relics must be placed in the inner shrines of \npagan temples, and the people converted gradually to the idea that \ntheir deity was a saint instead of an un-Christian spirit. 3 Pagan feast days \nwere to be Christianized. For example, at Christmas the people were \nto be allowed to sacrifice and eat "a great number of oxen to the glory of \nGod, as they had formerly done to the Devil." 4 \n\nThough the old deities were re-defined as devils, nominal Chris- \ntians continued to believe in them as firmly as they believed in Christ, .1 \nif not more so. 5 They were quite willing to consult "devils" for guidance* \nin their daily lives. The Venerable Bede said Redwald, king of the \nEast Saxons, kept in the same temple an altar to offer sacrifices to Christ \nand another altar to offer sacrifices to "devils." 6 Gothic converts to \nthe church simply added the name of Christ to their own lists of native I \ngods but dropped it with equal readiness if its magic proved \nineffective. 7 \n\nThis dual religious system persisted even through periods when \nthe "fairy-religion" was persecuted as witchcraft. It could be said that \nChristianity and paganism co-exist even now, for the greater part of \nChristian worship, sacraments, and basic theology came from the \npagan heritage. "The lamb, the dragon (or serpent), the dove above the! \naltar, the triangle enclosing the all-seeing eye (common to Freema- \nsonry as well), the sacred fish-symbol, the ever-burning fire, or the \nimage of the risen sun upon the receptacle for the consecrated wafer \nin the Roman Mass, the architectural symbols and the orientation of \nchurch and cathedral, the cross itself, and even the colors and designs \nof the robes of priest and bishop and pope, are a few of the silent \nwitnesses of the survival in the modern Christian churches of the \nsymbolism of paganism." 8 Even such essential doctrines as the virgin \nbirth, Incarnation, Logos, resurrection, salvation, purgatory, baptism, \n\n\n\n758 \n\n\n\nnd holy communion were products of paganism, developed many Paganism \n\nenturies before the Christian era. \n\nGiraldus Cambrensis complained in the 1 2th century that the __^^^^^^^^_ \n\nI eople of Ireland were still given over to "old, barbaric and obscene \nI ustoms." 9 The cult of Diana co-existed with Christianity in Devon as \nlite as the 14th century, when the Goddess was worshipped in \n\n\'oodland shrines even by monks. 10 At Cologne in 1333, Petrarch saw \nIjwomen conjuring the Rhine" in what was described as "a rite of the \nI eople." 11 \n\nThe people\'s religion had been largely in the hands of women \n\' ince Caesar\'s day, and so it remained up to the 12th and 13 th \ni enturies when active persecution of "witches" began. 12 Martin of \ni iraga, a 6th-century Portuguese missionary father, noted that wom- \nIn not only maintained their own un-Christian temples, but also \ni erformed domestic acts of worship like decorating tables, wearing \nI iurels, taking omens, offering bread to water spirits and wine to the \nI [ule log, calling upon Minerva when spinning, and invoking Venus \nit weddings and on the public road. "What is that but worship of the \njevil?" he asked. Moreover, he believed in the women\'s pagan \nI pities himself. He said the rivers, springs, and woods were filled with \ni Lamias, Nymphs, and Dianas; "and they were all malign devils and \nlefarious spirits." 13 \n\nA 10th-century Penitential tried to forbid women to present their \nInildren to Mother Earth at the crossroads in their ancient manner, \nJior this is great paganism." 14 A 16th-century Finnish bishop observed \n[pat "when people fall ill, they seek help from the devil by laying wax \nI gures, candles, squirrel skins and other things on the altars, and on \nlertain days sacrifice sheep and coins." 15 The 9th-century Synod of \nhome recorded pagan worship in the churches: "Many people, mostly \niKomen, come to church on Sundays and holy days not to attend the \ni [lass but to dance, sing broad songs, and do other such pagan things." 16 \n\nOf course the churches had deliberately lured women by taking \n[wer the shrines of their Goddess, with the promise that the rites \njpuld continue as usual. Churches were built over shrines of Syrian \nllstarte at Corbridge in Northumberland, of Diana Nemetona at \nUath, and of Sarapis and Mithra at York. 17 At Cangas de Onis, \n[Lrrichinaga, and other places in Spain, churches were built around \nI agan dolmens and sacred mounds, still in existence today. 18 Church \nI recessions featured carnival mummers in the masks and costumes of \nIndent beast-gods, such as the four totems of the pagan sacred year \n\non, bull, eagle, and serpent adopted as symbols of the evange- \n[kts. 19 Pagan deities appeared in the very carvings and decorations of \n\nhurches. As late as 1 576 a British church employed workmen to pull \n\nown and destroy "sundry superstitious things tending to the mainte- \n\nance of idolatry." 20 \n\nThe Christian church had no holidays of its own; every feast in the \n\nchristian calendar was borrowed from the pagans, including Easter \n\n\n\n759 \n\n\n\nPaganism an d Christmas. Roman festivals were particularly tenacious, until they \n\nhad to be given Christian names to excuse the people\'s continued \n^^^^^m^^b^ celebration of them. The Hilaria became the Feast of Annunciation; i \nRobigalia became the Feast of St. Mark; the Quinquatrus became the \nFeast of St. Joseph; St. Cyprian\'s Day replaced the day of Jupiter. 21 \'7 \nthousand years ago, old and young assembled in woods or on plains \nto bring gifts to their gods, and celebrated with dances, games, and \nofferings the festival of spring, or of awaking and blooming Nature. \nThese celebrations have taken Christian names, but innumerable old \nheathen rites and customs are still to be found in them." 22 \n\nChristian historians often give an impression that Europe\'s barba \nians welcomed the new faith, which held out a hope of immortality \nand a more kindly ethic. The impression is false. The people didn\'t \nwillingly give up the faith of their ancestors, which they considered \nessential to proper functioning of the earth\'s cycles. They had their ov \nhope of immortality and their own ethic, in many ways a kinder ethic \nthan that of Christianity which was imposed on them by force. 25 \nJustinian obtained 70,000 conversions in Asia Minor by methods that \nwere so cruel that the subject populations eventually adopted Islam in \norder to rid themselves of the rigors of Christian rule. 24 \n\nAs a rule, heathen folk resisted Christianity as long as they could, \neven after their rulers had gone over to the new faith for its material \nrewards. Louis the Pious baptized a Danish chieftain named Harald \nKlak, and gave him a large fief on the Weser river, on the under- \nstanding that he would convert his people; but the people rejected bot \nChristianity and Harald. In the 10th century, King Haakon of \nNorway was fiercely opposed when he tried to institute Christianity. . \npeople rebelled, burned the new Christian churches, and forced \nHaakon to eat the horse-liver sacrifices and drink New Year toasts to \nWoden, Frey, Bragi, and the totemic clan. Some rulers themselves \nrejected the new faith out of hand. Alcuin announced in the 8th \ncentury that there would never be any hope of Christianizing the \nDanes. Their king was "harder than a stone and wilder than any beast \nand would have none of Rome\'s God. 25 \n\nCertain words reveal by their derivation some of the opposition \nmet by missionaries. The pagan Savoyards called Christians "idiots," \nhence cretin, "idiot," descended from Chretien, "Christian." Germai \npagans coined the term bigot, from bei Gott, an expression constantly \nused by the monks. 26 Christians were the first to insist that there was \nonly one god, and it was theirs. This attitude tended to produce \nresentment among worshippers of other gods. \n\nThe Roman Empire tolerated all religions within its far-flung \nborders, so long as Rome\'s official deities received due lip-service, \nand the deified emperors were properly honored. This policy of reli- \ngious freedom was soon abandoned by the Roman church, which \nbegan to insist that all non-Christian faiths be destroyed; then that eve \nChristians of non-orthodox sects must give up their heretical "errors," \n\n\n\n760 \n\n\n\ndie. The beginning of organized Christianity marked the true end of Paganism \n\ne ancient world\'s polytheistic freedom of worship. The new Gospels \n\n:came the sole authority. Other scriptures were burned. Yet, despite ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe destruction, there was no real end to paganism. 27 The people \nmembered it and practiced it throughout the Christian era. \n\nThe third Council of Constantinople decreed in the 7th century \nat the people must stop kindling bonfires and leaping over them on \nights of the new moon. 28 St. Eligius wrote: "Let no Christian place \n^hts at the temples, or the stones, or at fountains, or at trees, or \nlclosures, or at places where three ways meet. . . . Let no one presume \nmake lustrations, or to enchant herbs, or to make flocks pass through \nhollow tree or an aperture in the earth; for by doing so he seems to \nnsecrate them to the devil." 29 Nevertheless, these activities \nntinued. \n\nIn vain the Council of Toledo condemned "worshippers of \nlols, those who venerate stones, who kindle torches, who celebrate the \ntes of springs and trees . . . men who go about in the mask of a stag \nr bull-calf, who dress in the skin of a herd animal, or put on the heads \nf beasts." 50 At Ephesus, twelve centuries after the time of Christ, \nicient fertility rites were still performed though Christian writers \nsported that "men took delight in unholy things as if they were pious \n;eds." 51 To the pagans, they were pious deeds. \n\nSlavs never ceased to worship Kupala, the Water-mother Va-kul, \nbios the horse god, Yarilo the fertility-savior, and the rest of their \nantheon. Bulgarian penitential books tried again and again to abolish \norship of the sun and moon without success. As late as the 18th \njntury, the bishop of Voronezh denounced the "satanic games" \n)nnected with the sacrifice of Yarilo; and the Bulgarian monk \npiridon complained that most of his countrymen still worshipped \nyerun the thunder god instead of Jesus. 32 \n\nThe old customs were preserved especially by women, who were \nat welcome in the new church, and preferred paganism for the \n)iritual authority it could confer on them. A 10th-century Ecclesiastical \nanon appealed to fathers, not mothers, to instruct their children in \nChristian ways. Men must "forbid well-worshippings, necromancies and \nvinations; enchantments and man-worshippings, and all the other \nlin practices which are carried out with various spells. . . . And we \nijoin that every Christian man zealously accustom his children to \nChristianity and teach them the Paternoster and the Creed. And we \nljoin that on feast-days, they abstain from heathen songs and devil\'s \nimes." 33 \n\nBut the songs and games went on, gradually taking on the guise of \nicular carnivals, harvest-homes, May dances, Oktoberfests, Midsum- \nler feasts, and so on. Women maintained many of these traditions, not \n;cause they were more rebellious than men but because they were \nlore conservative. Priestesses came to be called "witches" by their \nChristian enemies. "Pagan folk practices and beliefs, whether Greco- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n761 \n\n\n\nPaganism Roman, Teutonic, or Celtic, did not die out with the introduction of \n\nChristianity but rather remained and constituted the fundamental \n\ni^^^^^^^^^^^ substratum of witchcraft." 34 \n\nAfter centuries of denunciation and suppression, the church fou \nthat many pagan ceremonies were too tenacious to be stamped out \nand had to be assimilated by the Christian system. At the end of the \n18th century, Irish clergymen "artfully yielded to the superstitions of \nthe natives, in order to gain and keep up an establishment, grafting \nChristianity on Pagan rites." Bourne said "The monks, in the dark \nunlearned ages of Popery, copied after the heathens, and dreamed \nthemselves into the like superstitions." 35 Sometimes Christ and the \nold gods were incongruously blended, as at a 1 5th-century temple at \nIstein dedicated to "Jupiter Christus." 36 To this day, the pagan \nceremony of the New Fire is enacted each Easter on Mount Lycabet- \ntus, where it used to commemorate the rebirth of Apollo. \n\nMany pagan deities were remade into saints. Others were vagu< \nChristianized by interpreting them as prophetic figures. "Aescula- \npius, who suffered death because he had raised the dead, is a type of \nChrist. . . . Jupiter, changed into a bull and carrying Europa on his \nback, also typifies Christ, the sacrificial ox who bore the burden of the \nsin of the world. Theseus who forsook Ariadne for Phaedra prefigures \nthe choice which Christ made between the Church and the Synagogu \nThetis who gave her son Achilles arms with which to triumph over \nHector, is no other than the Virgin Mary who gave a body to the Son \nGod." 37 \n\nWith a combination of syncretism, reinterpretation and exeges \nChristianity managed to absorb nearly all of paganism except its \nGoddess. According to Guignebert: \n\nWestern peoples in the early centuries of the Christian era never really \nunderstood the Christian dogmas, nor have they understood them \nsince. The religion which they have constructed upon these dogmas : \nthrough their own efforts was something different . . . it was cast in \nformulas ill able to contain it. The Western peoples have, strictly speakir \n\nnever been Christians Bearing the impress only of the Christian \n\nlegend and nourished upon formulas passively repeated, these men th \nvast majority of professed Christians remained actually pagans, and \\ \nstill do so within the folds of the Catholic commonwealth. }S \n\n1.

(See Palladium.) \nThere was some disagreement as to Pales\'s sex. Some said he was a \njriapic ass-headed fertility spirit like Set, or Pan; others said Pales was \ni female, one of the disguises of Vesta under the name of Diva Palatua \nthe Palatine Goddess). 1 The temple of this androgynous deity was \nhe origin of the word "palace." His/her festivals were celebrated \negularly, several centuries into the Christian era, by priests wearing \niss-faced masks.

Roman legend said Aeneas carried off the Palladium from the \nivreckage of Troy and founded Rome with its help. It was a symbol of \ni protean, androgynous deity usually called Pallas, whose name meant \nither "maiden" or "youth." 1 \n\nSome said Pallas was identical with the Goddess Athene. Some \n\n\n\n763 \n\n\n\nPalladius said Pallas was a Pan-like goat god slain by Athene. Some said Pallas \n\nPalm Tree was a giant. Some said Pallas was a wooden image of a female warrior. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ Some said Pallas was a thunder-stone. A majority believed Pallas was \na phallic god and his Palladium was "the scepter of Priam, in the \nlikeness of a male sex organ." 2 \n\nIn Greek myth, Pallas had offspring, the Pallantids, who wor- \nshipped an Amazonian fighting Goddess, the enemy of the \npatriarchal Hellenic hero Theseus. 5 This may account for the notion \nthat Pallas was a female warrior, once a companion of Athene who \ntook her name and became Pallas Athene after accidentally killing her in \na mock battle. This classic myth bears the marks of revision, a story \ninvented to account for Athene\'s androgynous idol represented by a \nlingam-yoni, showing her union with Pallas, Pales, or Pan. \n\nThe Vestal Virgins were married to the spirit of Rome by means of \nan artificial phallus in the Palladian shrine; thus it seems probable that \nPallas was a sacred lingam signifying AMOR, the secret name of \nROMA in reverse. \n\nConstantine moved the Palladium to Constantinople and made it a \nsymbol of his own masculinity. It was buried under a huge red \nporphyry pillar topped by an image of himself in the guise of Apollo. 4 \n\n1. Graves, CM. 2, 403. 2. Graves, G.M. 2, 261, 266; Dumezil, 323, 583. \n3.

Palladius was \nassimilated to the Celtic pater, "Patrick," in a Christian legend that \nclaimed one Bishop Palladius was a missionary to the pagan Irish before \nSt. Patrick. 1 Both bishop and saint seem to have been purely \nimaginary (see Patrick, Saint). \n\n1. Encyc. Brit., "Patrick." \n\n\n\nPalm Tree \n\nIn the Babylonian myth of the primal garden, the palm tree was the \nTree of Life, a dwelling-place of the Goddess Astarte. The Hebrew \nversion of her name was Tamar, "Palm Tree." 1 \n\nHer male counterpart was Baal-Peor, or Phoenix, the god of \nPhoenicia whose name meant "Land of the Palm." As a phallic deity, \nBaal-Peor was symbolized by a palm tree between two large stones. \nSexual orgies in the temple celebrated his union with the Goddess in \nPhoenicia and in Israel until priests of Yahweh killed the celebrants in \nthe midst of their rites (Numbers 25:8). \n\nStill, the feminine connotations of the palm tree remained. The \nGoddess was often embodied in a Mother-palm, giving the food of \n\n\n\n764 \n\n\n\nlife in the form of coconut milk or dates. A complicated biblical myth \nshows Tamar the Palm-tree as the mother of a slain "firstborn of \nJudah"; and as a veiled sacred harlot decorated with the signet, staff, and \nbracelets of the nation of Judah; and as a widow (Crone) to whom \nofferings of goats were made; and as an idol "by the wayside," whom \npriests of Yahweh wanted to burn (Genesis 38). She gave birth to the \nrival twins Pharez and Zarah, Hebrew counterparts of Osiris and Set. \nThe spirit of the palm tree was still the Great Mother in the tradition \nof early Christians, who gave the title of Holy Palm (Ta-Mari) to the \nvirgin Mary. 2 Yet Egyptians continued to call a man\'s penis his \n"palm tree." 3 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 197. 2. Hughes, 55. 3. Book ofthe Dead, 518. \n\n\n\nPan \n\n\n\nPan \n\nKing of Arcadian satyrs, the horned and hoofed woodland god par \nexcellence. Pan was one of the oldest gods in Greece, associated with \nthe cult of Dionysus and sometimes identified with him. Pan was said \nto have coupled with all the Dionysian Maenads. In addition, he was \nmated to Athene, Penelope, Selene, and many archaic forms of the \nGreat Goddess. 1 \n\nGreeks claimed the Egyptian solar god Amon-Ra was the same as \nPan. They called Amon-Ra\'s holy city Panopolis, "City of Pan," \nsaying it was inhabited by "Pans and satyrs." The panoply (ceremonial \ndress and decoration) derives from holy processions in the City of \nPan. 2 Other words connected with Pan\'s cult are caper, caprice, and \ncapriccio, all from Latin caper, the goat. Pan\'s sacred drama of death \nand resurrection was the original "tragedy," from Greek tragoidos, \n"Goat Song." 3 The word "panic" was originally the terrible cry of \nPan, who dispersed his enemies with a magic yell that filled them with \nfear and took away all their strength. \n\nIt may be that Pan\'s legend began with the Hindu fertility god \nPancika, consort of one of the primal Mother-goddesses, many- \nbreasted Hariti, who suckled hundreds of pre- Vedic animal spirits as \nmany-breasted Diana suckled the woodland beasts, whose king Pan \nwas. 4 \n\nPan was an important model for medieval pagans\' Horned God, \nwhom the church called Satan. The devil always displayed Pan\'s \nattributes of goat-hoofs, horns, and unremitting lust; sometimes also a \ngoat head and an attendant throng of satyrs (demons). Yet the new \nromanticism of the 19th century laid aside the demonic nature attribut- \ned to Pan only a few centuries previously and made him a gentle \nimage of the lost Arcadia populated by shepherds and nymphs. Roman- \ntic poets adopted Pan as their wildwood god. \n\nIn 1821, Shelley wrote to his friend Thomas J. Hogg: "I am glad \nto hear that you do not neglect the rites of the true religion. Your \n\n\n\nPan\'s name has been \nderived from paein, \n"pasture"; it was also \nthe word for "all" and \nfor "bread," recalling \nvarious All-fathers who \nwere gods of divine \nbread, such as Osiris, \nAdonis, and Tam- \nmuz. Like them, Pan \nwas a sacred king \nwho died in fertilizing \nthe earth. The ritual \nphrase "Great Pan is \ndead" seems to have \nbeen taken from the \nrites of Tammuz; it \nwas also understood as \nThamus Pan-megas \nTethnece, "All-great \nTammuz is dead." \n\n\n\n765 \n\n\n\nPanacea letter awoke my sleeping devotion, and the same evening I ascended \n\nalone the high mountain behind my house, and suspended a garland, \n^^^^^^^^^ and raised a small turf-altar to the mountain-walking Pan." Oscar Wilde \nwrote wistfully: "O goat-foot god of Arcady! This modern world hath \nneed of thee!" 5 Byron wrote a regretful ode on the passing of Pan: \n\nThe Gods of old are silent on their shore \n\nSince the great Pan expired, and through the roar \n\nOf the Ionian waters broke a dread \n\nVoice which proclaimed "the mighty Pan is dead. " \n\nHow much died with him! false or true the dream \n\nWas beautiful which peopled every stream \n\nWith more than finny tenants, and adorned \n\nThe woods and waters with coy nymphs that scorned \n\nPursuing Deities, or in the embrace \n\nOf gods brought forth the high heroic race \n\nWhose names are on the hills and o \'er the seas. 6 \n\n1.

To this day, both Goddesses are invoked in the medical \nHippocratic Oath. 1 The two seem to have been personifications of the \nGreat Mother\'s breasts, source of the Milk of Kindness and the balm \nof healing. \n\nEgyptians said the remedy for almost every ill was "the milk of a \nwoman who has given birth to a child: such is the sweet perfume" \nthat could expel demons of sickness. 2 Panacea and Hygeia were \ncomparable to Egypt\'s Two Mistresses, Buto and Nekhbet, whose \nmilk bestowed divinity on pharaohs and health on everyone. 3 Buto was \nthe same nursing-mother Goddess called Latona, Lada, Leto or \nLeda, the Babylonians\' Allatu, the Arabs\' Al-Lat (who later became \nAllah). Etruscans called her Lat, mother of Latium and giver of \nmoon-milk. Latopolis, "Milk-City," was the Greek name for Buto\'s \noracular shrine, the oldest in Egypt. 4 \n\nMedieval Europe continued to believe in the curative virtues of \nmother\'s milk. It was said that any mother could cure her infant\'s sore i \neyes by squirting her milk into them. 5 Male doctors often recommended \nwoman-milk for the sick. \n\nIronically, one of the last superstitious believers in Panacea was \nPope Innocent VIII, author of the infamous bull Summis Desider- \nantes, which laid the legal foundations for persecution of witches and \ncaused the torture and death of millions of women.

A pagan might laugh at Apollo \ns a fable. A Christian would shudder at him as a malignant spirit." \' \nFirst of the demons in Pandemonium were the rival gods men- \noned in the Bible. To these were added the Celtic, Teutonic, and \naxon-Scandinavian deities; the deities of Greece and Asia Minor; and \nle Roman classical gods and goddesses. Specifically listed among the \nevils were Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, and Minerva. 2 Ruler of Pandemo- \nium was the underground god: Pluto, Hades, Zeus Chthonios, Saturn, \n.ucifer. \n\n1.

Lamusse, 143. \n\n\n\nandora \n\nAll-giver," title of the Earth-goddess Rhea, personified as the first \n\'Oman in an anti-feminist fable by Hesiod, who tried to blame war, \neath, disease, and all other ills on women. 1 \n\nPandora\'s vessel was not a box but a honey-vase, pithos, from \nhich she poured out blessings: a womb-symbol like the Cornucopia, \nnciently used as a vessel of death and rebirth. 2 Pandora\'s Vase became \nandora\'s Box only in the late medieval period, when Erasmus \nlistakenly translated pithos as pyxis} \n\nHesiod claimed Zeus sent Pandora to earth to punish men, who \nad offended him. She bore a vase filled not with blessings but with \nurses: strife, pain, death, sickness, and all other afflictions. Pandora in \n\n\n\n767 \n\n\n\nPangaea her curiosity opened the vase, as Zeus knew she would, and released \n\nParadise them among men. In a refinement of cruelty, Zeus also supplied \n\nmi ^ mm ^ m ^ a ^^ mm delusive Hope, to prevent men from killing themselves in despair and \nescaping the full meed of suffering their Heavenly Father intended for \nthem. 4 The basic theme is also familiar in the myth of Eve. \n\nHesiod\'s story was further adapted to the legend of King Solomon \nwho was said to keep a horde of demons in a vase. After his death, \ngreedy men broke the vase in seeking treasure and let the demons out \ninto the world. 5 \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1, 148. 2. Neumann, CM., 267. 3. Larousse, 93. \n4.

This animal was doubly canonized as the Lion of I \nSt. Mark, who replaced Venus as the city\'s patron and whose "relics" \noccupied the former Shrine of the Lion, now converted into St. \nMark\'s cathedral. \n\nBecause the character St. Pantaleone wore flowing trousers in the \neastern fashion, his costume came to be called "pantaloons," later \nshortened to "pants." \n\n1. Funk, 85-86. \n\n\n\nParadise \n\nThe Persian Pairidaeza (Paradise) was a magic garden surrounding \nthe holy mountain of the gods, where the Tree of Life bore the fruit of \nimmortality. Pairidaeza was also the divine Virgin who would give \nbirth to the future Redeemer: the Mahdi, or Messiah, or Savior, or \nDesired Knight of Saracenic Grail myths. Shi\'ite Arabs still look for \nthe coming of the Virgin Paradise, the next Holy Mother. 1 \n\nHebrew pardes, "garden," was derived from the same Virgin \nParadise. 2 In Solomon\'s Song the "enclosed garden" is the virgin \n\n\n\n768 \n\n\n\nmde whose fountain of life-giving fluid is not yet opened (Song of Paradise \n\nSolomon 4:12). A dual vision of paradise as a living garden and the \n\niving garden as a female body runs through all religious symbolism. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nLorenzo the Magnificent stated the same ancient theme in his \n\nlescription of heaven: "Nothing other than a pleasant garden, abundant \n\nvith all pleasing and delightful things, of trees, apples, flowers, vivid \n\nunning waters, song of birds, and in effect all the amenities dreamed of \n\n>y the heart of man; and by this one can affirm that Paradise was \n\nvhere there was a beautiful woman, for here was a copy of every \n\namenity and sweetness that a kind heart might desire." 3 \n\nThe psychological model of paradise was life\'s first experience of \nromforting love, the mother who warmed and fed the infant right \nIfter its terrifying birth trauma. Having "fallen" from the comfort of the \nbomb into a world of painful stimuli, if the child is not embraced and \nlulled into the illusion that the lost paradise has nearly been regained, \nne foundations for later neurosis will be laid." 4 Often the dweller in \nparadise was in a state of pseudo-infancy. When an Egyptian pharaoh \name to his two divine mothers in the after-world, "They draw their \n[reasts to his mouth, and never more do they wean him." 5 Egyptian \nunerary priestesses bared their breasts when escorting a dead man to \nlis tomb, probably as a magical promise of the nursing Goddess\'s tender \npre. 6 As further insurance, she was painted inside the sarcophagus \nd, reaching down with her arms to clasp the deceased against her bared \nreast, like a mother reaching for her baby. 7 \n\nPrimitive notions of paradise as land flowing with milk and honey \n/ere clearly representative of the mother\'s body in the earliest \nriemories. An elderly Kikuyu chief spoke of these memories, still vivid \nhis mind: \n\nShe was always there; I can remember the comforting feel of her body as \nshe carried me on her back and the smell of her skin in the hot sun. Ev- \nerything came from her. When I was hungry or thirsty she would swing \nme around to where I could reach her full breasts; now when I shut my \neyes I feel again with gratitude the sense of well-being that I had when I \nburied my head in their softness and drank the sweet milk that they \ngave. At night when there was no sun to warm me, her arms, her body, \ntook its place; and as I grew older and more interested in other things, \nfrom my safe place on her back I could watch without fear as I wanted and \nwhen sleep overcame me I had only to close my eyes. 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern culture made this paradise the birthright of every \nrimitive child a paradise lost. Dr. Henry pointed out that "No other \nulture has invented so many excuses for keeping a mother away \nrom her infant." 9 Wickler said a human baby is, like a monkey baby, by \nature "a mother-hugger and should be carried against the mother\'s \nody continuously in the early days of its life, as is still the custom \nmong primitive races today. The entire behavior repertory of the \nlewborn baby is adapted for this. ... It is not biological for us to place \n\n\n\n769 \n\n\n\nParadise our babies in cribs. Symptomatic of this is that the babies cry out of \n\nloneliness with abnormal frequency in our culture, while one scarcely \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ ever finds this among the children of primitive peoples." 10 \n\nPsychologists know the image of the lost mother is projected ontc \nthe sexual partner, which accounts for the extraordinary sexual \nsignificance attached to women\'s breasts. Erasmus Darwin noted that \nthe symbolism even goes beyond the breast per se: "When any object \nof vision is presented to us, which by its waving or spiral lines bears any \nsimilitude to the form of the female bosom ... we experience an \nattraction to embrace it with our arms, and to salute it with our lips, as \nwe did in our early infancy the bosom of our mother." " Man often \nsees himself in an infantile relationship to a woman who may be \nembraced and kissed that is, a wife or mistress. The Bengali poet \nChandidas addressed himself to a loved woman as if he were her infanl \n"I have taken refuge at your feet, my beloved. . . . You are to me as a \nparent to a helpless child." n \n\nA psychiatrist notes that most sexual fantasies of adult males "seei \nappropriate for a naive four-year-old, whose most important gratifica- \ntions primarily depend on mother. ... He shows unacknowledged sign \nof longing for her with the same fervor he did when she was all the \nworld to him, the holy center of his child\'s universe. His desire seems \nunmodified by his conscious perception and understanding of the \nrealities of life and the limited possibilities for gratification with his \nmother." 13 \n\nSimilarly, the desire to return to the perfect comfort of the womb \nin a post-mortem paradise seems unmodified by conscious recogni- \ntion of its improbability. Hidden prenatal memory surfaces in many \nreligious visions of the bliss of paradise, expressing a powerful wish \nthat what was lost at birth may be regained after death. To those traine< \nin interpretation of unconscious symbolism it is clear that the meta- \nphors of eternity represent a return to the womb. 14 When death is neai \nthe mind may even present vivid fantasies reminiscent of the mater- \nnal comfort that followed the birth trauma and soothed away the first \nexperiences of pain and fear. \n\nThus we find that the garden-paradise from which humanity "fell \nin the beginning was a genital symbol: garden, gate, grove, holy \nmount (mons veneris). This was suggested by the word Eden, meaning \nin Hebrew "a place of delight." 15 In the Middle Ages the usual \nmetaphor for paradise was the Garden of Delights, a term less charac- \nteristic of the Christian heaven than of the other paradise, Fairyland \nor Avalon, where sexuality was permitted. Christian tradition forbade \nsexual love and marriage in heaven (Matthew 22:30), but the pagan \ntradition continued to view paradise as the epitome of all sensual \ngratifications and the satisfaction of all sexual-romantic yearnings. \n\nChristians adopted the word paradise as a synonym for their own \nheaven, and insisted that the pagans\' paradise was really hell, with a \nfalse appearance of beauty to lure sinners. In rebellion against this \n\n\n\n770 \n\n\n\ntheory, bards openly expressed a preference for hell. Aucassin gives \nan example: \n\nFor into Paradise go none but such folk as I shall tell thee now: Thither go \nthese same old priests, and halt old wen and maimed, who all day and \nnight cower continually before the altars, and in the crypts; and such folk \nas wear old mantles and old tattered frocks, and naked folk and shoeless, \nand covered with sores, perishing of hunger and thirst, and of little ease. \nThese be they that go into Paradise; with them have I naught to do. \nBut into Hell would I fain go . . . thither pass the sweet ladies and \ncourteous that have two lovers, or three, and their lords also thereto. \nThither go the gold, and the silver, and cloth ofvair, and cloth ofgris, and \nharpers, and makers, and the prince of this world. With these I would \ngladly go, let me but have with me Nicolette, my sweetest lady. l6 \n\nOther ballads and early medieval romances rejected the Chris- \ntian paradise for its lack of feminine company. The Irish Fenians, whose \nrule was never to insult a woman, were said to have gone to hell for \ndenying Christian anti-feminist doctrines. The heathen sage Oisin \n(Ossian) rejected St. Patrick\'s heaven on the ground that it had no \nhunting, no bardic poetry, and no love of fair women. Oisin said he \nwould rather join the Fenians in hell. 17 \n\nMost people refused to believe that hell was identical with their \nbeloved Fairyland, Avalon, Cockaigne, Torelore, Valhalla, Isles of \nthe Blest, or whatever pagan paradise they professed; so it came to be \ncalled the earthly paradise, as opposed to the heavenly one. This \nrealm of the Fairy Queen was usually placed in the Far West. Revered \npopular heroes dwelt there: Oberon, Lancelot, Tristan, Arthur, \nOgier the Dane, and many others. 18 Since these heroes lived forever, \nthe Irish called their paradise Thierna na Oge, the country of eternal \nyouth. A wonderful fountain at its heart dispensed the Water of Life \nthat made old men young again. \n\nBelief in this ancient idea may have inspired the westward voyages \nof Leif Ericson, Columbus, and the legendary St. Brendan the \nVoyager, who was really a canonized form of the sea-god Bran, \ndiscoverer of the Cauldron of Regeneration. St. Brendan was said to \nhave discovered it too, on a magic isle in the west. But "St. Brendan\'s \nIsle" was never found. 19 Ponce de Leon went looking for it, and \nclaimed to have discovered the Fountain of Youth in Florida, which he \ncalled Bimini. 20 \n\nChurchmen also believed in this earthly paradise. St. Thomas \nAquinas was sure it existed and stated that Elijah and Esdras still lived \nthere. 21 The 13th-century Hereford Map showed it as a circular island \noff the coast of India, which Columbus thought he could reach by \nsailing west. Hugo de St. Victor said the island of paradise was "a spot in \nthe Orient productive of all kinds of woods and pomiferous trees. It \ncontains the Tree of Life: there is neither cold nor heat there, but \nperpetual equable temperature. It contains a fountain which flows \nforth in four rivers." A Danish hero was said to have reached it by \n\n\n\nParadise \n\n\n\nAucassin Hero of \nthe French medieval \nromantic poem \nAucassin et Nicolette, \nbased on the character \nof an earlier Arabic \nlover-hero, Al-Kasim. \n\n\n\n771 \n\n\n\nPariah traveling to India and entering the mouth of a dragon who guarded \n\nPartridge the bridge to the mystic island. 22 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m The bridge to paradise appeared in nearly all Indo-European \n\nmyths. It was sometimes a dragon or serpent, but most often a \nrainbow. Persians called it the Kinvad Bridge. Babylonians called it the \nNecklace of Ishtar. Norsemen called it Bifrost, or sometimes Brisin- \ngamen, the Necklace of Freya. Beyond it, the gods dwelt in Asgard or \nValhalla, in a castle called Gladsheim (Joyous Home). In Grail \nmyths, this was the Grail Castle on Mount Joy; in the Arthurian cycle, il \nwas Lancelot\'s fortress, Joyous Gard. The pagan paradises had many \n"mansions," like the paradise of Osiris which Jesus claimed for his own \ndeity (John 14:2). 23 \n\n1. Lederer, 181. 2. Hughes, 47. 3. Hughes, 99. 4. Fodor, 33. 5.

Athene was worshipped in Boeotia as Once, the Pear Pastos \n\nTree, mother of all pear trees. Perdix\'s name originally meant "the ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nLost One." He was a form of Vishnu-Narayana, called Lord of Pear \n\nTrees at his holy city of Badrinath in the Himalayas (from badri, \n\n"pear tree"). The pear tree had feminine-maternal significance through \n\nEurasia. It was also sacred to Hera, whose oldest image at the \n\nHeraeum in Mycenae was made of pear wood. 2 European peasants \n\nconsidered the pear a favorite "life-tree" for a girl.

Harrison, 344. \n\n\n\nBook of Leinster A \n\n1 2th-century Irish \ncodex containing \nstories and poems from \nthe pagan tradition. \n\n\n\nPatrick, Saint \n\nPatron saint of Ireland, probably a fictitious figure built on Roman \npater or patricius, a priest. The only evidence for the existence of a \nChristian St. Patrick was his own autobiography, supposedly written \nin the 5th century but not heard of until 400 years later. 1 Thus it seems \nthat Patrick\'s purported writings were forged by monks wishing to \npretend Ireland was Christianized earlier than it actually was. It is highly \nunlikely that the Irish were converted as early as the 5th century. In \nthe 12th century, St. Bernard complained that the Irish were still given \nover to "barbarous rites," Christianity having failed to take root \namong them. 2 \n\nLike many other saints evolved by 9th- and 10th-century hagiogra- \nphy, Patrick had pagan precedents. One was the Irish god of the \nshamrock, Trefuilngid Tre-eochair, "Triple Bearer of the Triple Key," \nwhose sacred plant bore all edible fruits including the apples of \nimmortality. He was a son-consort of the Triple Goddess whose triple \nyoni was represented by shamrock designs from the earliest civiliza- \ntions of the Indus valley. The story that St. Patrick explained the \nChristian trinity to the Irish by exhibiting the shamrock was entirely \napocryphal. The Irish worshipped the shamrock as a sign of their triple \npagan deities. The Book of Leinster said Patrick\'s mother was the \nGoddess Macha: she of the feminine trinity who gave birth to the \nshamrock-god. 3 \n\nMany other stories suggested Patrick\'s true paganism. He was \neducated by a druid. 4 In Wales he bore the title of Maenwyn, \nmeaning one dedicated to the moon. 5 The legend of his martyrdom \nindicated that he was sacrificed to the Moon-goddess, but like a pagan \ngod he was united with her Virgin incarnation, Brigit. The funerary \ntemple at Downpatrick was dedicated to both Brigit and Patricius. 6 \nThe Welsh form of the Triple Goddess, Guinevere, was said to have \nslain "the Irish knight Sir Patrice" with her magic apple, recalling the \nGoddess\'s gift of an apple of immortality to each of her doomed lovers. 7 \n\n\n\n774 \n\n\n\nWith all his pagan precedent, it is not surprising to find the Paul, Saint \n\nmonkish version of Patrick declaring himself "a sinner . . . despised \nby many." 8 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSt. Patrick\'s Day was known throughout the Roman empire as the \nday of apotheosis of the god slain during the Ides of March: Liber \nPater or Mars Pater, who would have been known as Patricius or \nPatrick in Britain. 9 At his Roman festival on March 1 7, a gigantic \nphallus was paraded through the streets, and solemnly crowned with a \ngarland representing the divine yoni, by the hands of a specially \nselected matron. 10 The phallus of Liber Pater was also known as the \nPalladium, planted in the womb-temple of Vesta. The priest who \nrepresented this god\'s power was the pater patrum, "father of fathers," \nor else the Peter (the phallic stone pillar), or else Palladius. An old \nchronicle mentioned a Roman-Irish martyr called Bishop Palladius, \n"the first bishop to the Irish who believe in Christ," sacrificed to the \nIrish Moon-goddess before Patrick appeared. 11 Evidently both Palladius \nand Patrick were the same pagan god, adopted into the canon after \nhis old shrines were taken over by Christians. 12 \n\n1.

Graves, W.G., 152. \n\n\n\n\'aul, Saint \n\nThe true founder of orthodox Christianity was Paul, who either \ncomposed or inspired the earliest identifiably Christian writings, predat- \ning the Gospels. 1 Paul laid down the basic orthodox doctrines: hope \nof high rank in heaven for the pure; avoidance of women and sexuality; \nseparation of body and soul. "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, \nand the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the \nother" (Galatians 5:17). Paul copied the more ascetic Gnostic sects \nof his time, when "a gulf never completely to be closed again is opened: \nGod and world, God and nature, spirit and nature, become divorced, \nalien to each other, even contraries." 2 \n\nOne key to this process was separation of male and female \nprinciples in religion. Father Heaven and Mother Earth were no \nonger wedded. Women were no longer participants in sacred mysteries \naccording to Paul. The church must be entirely patriarchal; women \nwere forbidden to teach or preach in it. Paul also laid the guilt of original \nsin on woman alone, absolving man from responsibility: "Adam was \nnot deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression" \n(1 Timothy 2:1 1-14). \n\nPaul\'s antipathy toward women and sexuality leads to a suspicion \nthat his esoteric doctrine was linked with the early Christian practice \nof voluntary castration, recommended by Jesus for "the kingdom of \n\n\n\n775 \n\n\n\nPaul, Saint heaven\'s sake" (Matthew 1 9: 1 2). In Paul\'s day, Rome revered the \n\nself-castrated god Attis and Paul was an earnest admirer of Roman \n\nwm^^^mmi^^^^m culture, as shown by the fact that he Romanized his name, changing \nit from Saul to Paul. Roman Christians later used self-castration as an \nautomatic ticket to heaven, in the manner of Attis\'s priests. 3 Tertul- \nlian said the heavenly gates were always thrown open to eunuchs. 4 \nIn a secretive, elliptical style typical of contemporary mystical \nwritings, Paul suggested that he was among the divinely favored \neunuchs. He often mentioned, but never described, his mysterious \n"infirmity" which he called a "light affliction, which is but for a \nmoment" though it would bring him eternal glory (2 Corinthians 4:17\' \nIt assimilated him to Christ, and "They that are Christ\'s have \ncrucified the flesh with the affections and lusts" (Galatians 5:24). \n\nPaul hinted that he was one of the "new creatures" in Christ, \nneither circumcised nor uncircumcised. A man would have to be one c \nthe other, unless he altogether lacked a penis. Paul made an oblique \nreference to a mutilation: "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord \nJesus" (Galatians 6:17). He scorned the "natural" (unmutilated) man \nfor his lack of spirituality: "The natural man receiveth not the things of \nthe Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him" (1 Corinthians \n2:14). Nevertheless, Paul recognized that some men might prefer to \nremain natural. Although "it is good for a man not to touch a \nwoman," he proposed that such men be allowed to take wives, "to avoii \nfornication." Yet this was a grudging concession, given "by permis- \nsion, and not of commandment. For I would that all men were even as \nmyself" (1 Corinthians 7:1-7). \n\nPaul wrote to the Galatians: "I would they were even cut off whic! \ntrouble you" (Galatians 5:12). The word rendered "cut off" also \nmeant "castrated." 5 Paul said those who "bite and devour one anoth \ner" terms often applied to sexual behavior may be consumed. But \nthose who are in the Spirit "shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh" \n(Galatians 5:1 5-16). In his addresses to the Romans, Paul seemed to \noffer himself and some of his followers as examples of the virtue of \nsexlessness: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? . . . Our old \nman is crucified with him Jesus], that the body of sin might be \ndestroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead j \nfreed from sin. . . . Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that \nye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as \ninstruments of unrighteousness unto sin. . . . I speak after the manner \nof men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your \nmembers servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so \nnow yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. (Roman \n6:2-19) \n\nPaul spoke "after the manner of men," as if he were not one, \nbecause his hearers\' flesh had an "infirmity" that he didn\'t share. He \nasked them to crucify and destroy "our old man," a common Middle- \n\n\n\n776 \n\n\n\nEastern epithet for the phallus. "He that is dead is freed from sin" Paul, Saint \n\nbecause he could no longer serve the "uncleanness" of women. \n\nThe Jews would naturally have argued that sterility was a violation ^^^^^^^^^^ \nof divine law, since Yahweh\'s commandment was to be fruitful and \nmultiply. Paul insisted that this commandment was obsolete. God had \nchanged his mind. Paul declared that fruitfulness of the flesh now \nmeant death rather than life: \n\nFor when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins . . . did work in our \nmembers to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered \nfrom the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve \nin newness of spirit. . . . Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, \nwrought in me all manner of concupiscence. . . . Fori was alive without \nthe law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I \ndied. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be \ndeath. (Romans 7:4-10) \n\nPaul found the divine law of reproduction outdated and distaste- \nful because it brought forth "fruit unto death" i.e., more life doomed \nto die. Therefore he "died" from the carnal life and acquired new \nspirituality. "The carnal mind (or, minding of the flesh) is enmity \nagainst God ... so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. \n... For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit \ndo mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (Romans 8:7-1 3). \n\nPaul used the parable of the wild olive tree, whose branches must \nbe lopped off, to be grafted onto a fruitful tree. To those whose \n"branches" were lopped off for the kingdom of heaven\'s sake, he \npromised better replacements in the hereafter, for "God is able to \ngraff them in again. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is \nwild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature to a good olive \ntree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be \ngraffed onto their own olive tree?" (Romans 1 1:23-25). \n\nThis parable, Paul said, was an important "mystery" of which his \nfollowers must not be ignorant. He pleaded for cutting of the sinful \nbranch: "I beseech you therefore, brethren . . . that ye present your \nbodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your \nreasonable service" (Romans 12:1). Paul\'s "living sacrifice" may well \nhave been like those of Buddhist ascetics and Aztec holy men who \nhabitually practiced penile mutilations to win the favor of the gods. \n\nJohn the Baptist used arboreal symbolism like Paul\'s: "the ax is laid \nto the root of the trees" (Matthew 3:10). In pagan context, this \nmeant castration of the fertility king. The wild olive, "castrated" with a \ngolden sickle like the oracular oaks of Dodona, figured in the myths \nof Heracles and his Tyrian counterparts. 6 The genital blood of a \ncastrated king was the food of immortality, according to the Book of \nthe Dead; the soul of man was nourished on the food "shed upon the \nolive tree." 7 The olive branch was, and is, a sign of Peace; and \nPeace" meant the death of a phallic god, who received the Word of \nPeace at his departing. Here is a parable of which modern scholars \n\n\n\n777 \n\n\n\nPazuzu should not be ignorant. The lopped-off olive branch was carried in the \n\nPeacock oeak f the Dove, emblem of Aphrodite, who castrated sacred kings. 8 \n\n^^^^hm^^hh 1. Enslin, L.C.M, 233-38. 2. Jonas, 251. 3.

Great Mother Hsi Wang Mu ruled the \nmagic peach garden in the west, where the gods were reborn. 1 \n\nPeach Blossom meant a virgin in Taoist symbolism, while the fruit \nstood for a mature woman whose juices were essential to man\'s \nhealth. China\'s patron saint of longevity Shou Lou was an old man with \na high bulging forehead, bursting with "yin juice" he had absorbed \nand sent up to his head through sexual coupling with many women. To \nreveal his mystical secret, Shou Lou always held up a peach with one \nof his fingers stuck into its cleft. 2 \n\nChinese wizards made magic wands from peach twigs. These \nmight be compared to magic wands made in the west from other \nwoods sacred to the Goddess, such as witch hazel, witch-willow, apple \nboughs, or holly. 3 \n\nWestern writers sometimes confused the Oriental peach with the \napricot, because abricot was once a European word for the vulva. \nSculptures from the pagan period at Nimes showed examples of this \nfruit in conjunction with phalli. 4 \n\n1.

The peacock\'s iridescent \ntail-feather "eyes" symbolized the Goddess\'s watchfulness, her many- \ncolored veils, and her plumes of justice, against which the hearts of \n\n\n\n778 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[nen were weighed, as against the plumes of Maat in Egypt. The Pearly Gate \n\n>eacock belonged to Juno when she was still the Etruscan Goddess \n\nJni, the Great Yoni. It also belonged to the Hindu Goddesses Sarasvati ^^^^^^^^^^ \nmd Maya, and their Argive counterpart Hera. 1 \n\nJuno\'s priests and priestesses in their sacred processions carried tall \n>eacock-feather fans called flabelh. These articles were taken over by \nChristian popes and are still displayed at papal Easter services. They are \nlow said to represent "the many-eyed vigilance of the church." 2 \n\nBecause it was a matriarchal totem originally, the peacock tended \no attract the same opprobrium as black cats, opals, ladders, pentacles, \nnirrors, owls, and moonlight. Christian superstition generally viewed \nhe peacock as a bird of doom. St. James\'s Gazette reported in 1888: \n\'Nobody who has not gone exhaustively into the subject can have any \ndequate idea of the amount of general inconvenience diffused by a \n>eacock. Broken hearts, broken limbs, pecuniary reverses, and various \norms of infectious disease have all been traced to the presence of a \n>eacock." According to some legends, the peacock became a bad-luck \nird because it was the only one who consented to show Satan the \nvay to paradise an echo of the pagan belief that the peacock was \nuno\'s psychopomp. 5 \n\nIn the Orient, however, the peacock remained a Bird of Paradise, \n\'eacocks were encouraged to wander about the precincts of any \niindu temple and in the royal gardens. Like doves in western Europe, \neacocks were considered soul-birds and emblems of good fortune, \nometimes even oracles. \n\n1. Jobes, 224. 2. Brewster, 166. 3. Leland, 1 54. \n\n\n\n\'early Gate \n\nEntrance to heaven; a Christian borrowing from the cult of Aphrodite \nCarina, or the Sea-mother Mari, to whom pearls were sacred. Her own \n>ody was the Gate of Heaven, like the Jade Gate of the Chinese \noddess, through which all men passed at birth (outward) and again at \neath (inward). Various yonic symbols of the Goddess were said to be \nordered with pearls, including even the Celts\' sacred Cauldron of \nRegeneration. (See Cauldron.) \n\nWhen the Goddess appeared in the guise of the moon, she was \nailed Pearl of the Sea, or Pearl of Wisdom; her seven high \n>riestesses were the Seven Pillars of Wisdom (see Pleiades). As the \nnoon was the gate of paradise, so was the Goddess. Early Christian \nectaries copied the pagans in claiming that the souls of the dead \nmount up by the pillar of dawn to the sphere of the moon, and the \nnoon receives them incessantly from the first to the middle of the \nnonth, so that it waxes and gets full, and then it guides them to the \nun until the end of the month, and thus effects its waning in that it is \nightened of its burden." \' \n\n\n\n779 \n\n\n\nPegasus The pearly moon-gate like Mother Earth made no distinctions j \n\nbetween those who could be admitted and those who could not; as all \n\n^^ m ^^^^^ammm living things were her own children, so all dead things were her charg< \nalso. When Christian mythology supplied a gatekeeper in the form of \nSt. Peter, then the Pearly Gate became a barrier where a judgment w \nmade on the worthiness or unworthiness of the soul. \n\nThe ancients gave all pearls the feminine connotation, saying the \nwere made of two female powers, the moon and water. It was \nbelieved that pearls should be worn only at night, for moonlight woulc \nenhance their luster whereas sunlight would spoil them. 2 \n1. Jonas, 233. 2. de Lys, 284-85. \n\n\n\nPegasus \n\nWinged horse of Greek myth, symbol of the sacred king\'s or hero\'s \njourney to heaven; an image of death and apotheosis, like the mythic \ndeath-horses of northern Europe. 1 Pegasus had archaic, matriarchal \norigins. He sprang from the "wise blood" of the Moon-goddess Me- \ndusa, who embodied the principle oimedha, the Indo-European root \nword for female wisdom. Or, alternatively, he was the magic horse \nArion, "moon creature on high," born of the Goddess Demeter and \nridden by Heracles in his role of sacred king in Elis. There was an earl \nfemale Pegasus named Aganippe, "the Mare Who destroys merci- \nfully," actually a title of Demeter herself as the destroying lunar \nNight-Mare. 2 \n\nPegasus was named for the Pegae, water-priestesses who tended \nthe sacred spring of Pirene in Corinth. The cult seems to have been \nrooted in Egypt. The oldest shrine of Osiris at Abydos (ca. 2000 b.c.) \ncentered on on a sacred spring called Pega. 3 \n\nThe Greek Pegae preserved an ancient dying-god cult, as shown \nby the myth of Bellerophon, who mounted Pegasus and tried to ride \nto heaven "as though he were an immortal." He failed, and fell. \nBellerophon\'s predecessor (mythologized as his "father") also failed, \nand was devoured by wild man-eating mares. This was not meant to \nsuggest that human flesh ever became incorporated into an equine \ndiet. It meant rather that "the pre-Hellenic sacred king was torn in \npieces at the close of his reign by women disguised as mares." 4 \n\nPegasus represented divine inspiration as well as godlike apotheo \n\nsis. A man who rode him could become a great poet. Pegasus\'s \n\ncrescent-moon-shaped hoof stamped the ground and dug the Hippo- \n\ncrene (Horse- Well), a spring of poetic inspiration on Mount Helicon, \n\nthe home of the Muses. This was another kind of immortality; the rid< \n\nof Pegasus could figuratively "fly through the air, to reach the \n\nheavens." 5 \n\n1. Eliade, S., 467. 2. Graves, CM. 1, 239, 255; W.G., 425. 3.

Pelican \n\nth century a.d.) Pelagia the Penitent, Pelagia of Antioch, Pelagia of MMMMMni \narsus, et al. All were fictions built on the epithet of Aphrodite \nelagia, "Sea." They were identified also with St. Margaret or St. \nlarina, other "pelagic" titles of the same Goddess. \n\nSometimes Pelagia was a beautiful dancing girl, converted by a \nChristian preacher and made to repent. Sometimes she was a \neautiful virgin who threw herself from a housetop to avoid losing her \nirginity. Sometimes she was a beautiful Christian maiden who \nxirned a royal lover, the son of Diocletian (or, in some versions, the \nmperor himself), and for this she was roasted to death in a brazen \null. 1 The stories apparently were inspired by statues of the Goddess \nibeled "Pelagia," and some of the methods of destroying them. \n\nAnother legend showed Pelagia differently, as a temptress trying to \narrupt a male saint. He was St. Hilary, who wandered into a remote \nJpine village when the people were celebrating pagan rites of Midsum- \nler under the guidance of their chatelaine, Lady Pelagia. She \n\'elcomed the holy man to her palace and asked him many deep \nuestions. When she asked, "What is the distance from heaven to \nell?," a heavenly voice commanded St. Hilary to breathe on her in the \name of Christ. He did so, and she suddenly turned into a statue of \nphrodite. In the morning the statue fell to pieces, and the magic palace \nas revealed as a ruin of an old Roman city. 2 \n\nThe same riddle was asked again in the legend of St. Andrew, who \nxplained that only Satan could know the distance from heaven to \nell because he had measured it in his fall. 3 \n\nAnother legend of Pelagia repeated the same tale told of many \nther fictitious she-saints, namely that she disguised herself as a man \nid spent some time living in a community of monks, under the name \nf Pelagius. 4 This may have been connected with the early apocry- \nhal Gospels that forbade women to be Christians unless they "made \nlemselves male." 5 \n\n1.

The legend probably \nrose from the pelican\'s habit of resting with its bill sunk in its breast \nathers. \n\n\n\n781 \n\n\n\nPenates \nPentacle \n\n\n\nSt. Augustine accepted this ancient fantasy of the mother pelican>j \nas fact, and so did subsequent churchmen, for no one dared contra- \ndict Augustine even though no pelican had ever been seen opening j \nown breast. 1 The self-sacrificing mother pelican became a popular \nmotif on both ecclesiastical and secular coats of arms. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 179. \n\n\n\nPenates \n\nRoman household gods who protected the penus, a grain-storage \nchamber, once associated with the family tomb.

She was once an orgiastic \nfertility-mother, as shown by the legend that she took all her "suitors" \ninto her bed, and she was both the mother and the consort of Pan. 1 \n\nHer function in the Odyssey was to account for Odysseus\'s \ncharmed life. As long as Penelope refrained from cutting her thread, \nOdysseus couldn\'t die. So he survived many dangerous adventures \nwhile she wove and unwove the tapestry of his life, never cutting it \noff. He even overcame the death-curse cast on him by Hecuba. 2 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 392. 2.

In Egypt the five-pointed \nstar represented the underground womb. 5 \n\nUse of the pentacle as an amulet of protection or healing was \ncommon in Babylon, where it was often drawn on pots to preserve \ntheir contents. The amulet known as The Seven Seals shows a pentack \nas the first of its holy signs. According to Judeo-Christian tradition, \nthe Seals were supposed to represent the secret names of God, and \nthe pentacle was the chief of them, inscribed on King Solomon\'s \n\n\n\n782 \n\n\n\nmagic ring. 4 Thus it was sometimes erroneously called Solomon\'s Seal. Penthesileia \n\nHowever, it was more closely connected with pagan deities than \nwith the Jewish one. A pentacle with one point straight down __. \n\nrepresented the Horned God, whom Neoplatonic philosophers called \nPentamorph, "He of the Five Shapes." 5 He appeared in human \nform as well as the four horned animals, bull, ram, goat, and stag. \n\nPagan Celts like the Egyptians revered the pentacle as a sign of the \nunderground Goddess, whom they called Morgan. In her honor, the \nsolar hero Gawain carried a pentacle on his blood-red shield. 6 \n\nHermetic magicians used the pentacle for their model of Man the \nMicrocosm. A male figure was placed inside a circle representing the \ncosmos: his feet, hands, and head touched the circle at the points \ndesignated by the inscribed pentacle, his genitals being located exactly \nin its center. 7 This image was related to Firmicus Maternus\'s remark \nthat man is a microcosm ruled by "the five stars." 8 \n\nLike other figures constructed of a single unbroken line, the \npentacle was believed to afford protection from spirits, who needed \nthe "gates" formed by a broken line. Therefore the pentacle was often \nused to mark off magical enclosures, especially for invocation. Medi- \neval churchmen consequently took to calling it by such names as Devil\'s \nSign, Witch\'s Cross, Wizard\'s Star, Goblin\'s Cross, or Witch\'s \nFoot. 9 It was thought that a vampire or werewolf would show a pentacle \non the foot sole or palm of the hand. This notion may be compared \nwith the five-petaled Lotus that appeared on the hands of Buddha. 10 \n\nContinuous appearances of the pentacle in magic books probably \ninfluenced Slavic witches who tried to cure diseases by "measuring \nthe pentacle" on the patient. A string was stretched from feet to chin, \nfrom the middle finger of each hand to the other, from each hand to \nthe opposite foot, while the sufferer stood in the position of Microcos- \nmic Man. "Differences in measurement give diagnosis and \nprognosis, and cutting the twine with a knife after each measurement \ncuts away the sickness. The bits of twine are burned so that the \npatient may inhale the fumes, and the ashes are placed in fresh water, of \nwhich the patient drinks a portion." u \n\nMagic charms using the pentacle are still extant. Gypsies still cut \nthe apple to reveal the Kore, the Pentacle of the Virgin, which they \ncall Star of Knowledge. 12 \n\nl.Hornung,212. 2. Pepper & Wilcock, 23. 3. Budge, E.L.,75. 4.

Various sources agree that when she was dead, Achilles raped \n\n\n\n783 \n\n\n\nPerceval \n\n\n\nher corpse. Some stories say her eyes were gouged out and she was \ndragged by one foot and thrown into a river. Others say she was taken \nup respectfully and buried with honor as a great heroine. 1 \nl.Graves,G.M.2,3B. \n\n\n\nRoman de Perceval \n\nAlternate name for the \nConte del Graal \nwritten by Chretien de \nTroyes about 1185, \nfinished later \nby other hands. \n\n\n\nPerceval \n\nAlso known as Parsifal, Percival, Persevelle, and other variations, this \nprotean hero of medieval romance united many myths both pagan and \nChristian. \n\nHe was first manifested as the Welsh ithyphallic demigod Peredur \nPaladrhir, whose name meant "Spearman with a Long Shaft," \ncarrying the same sexual implication as Osiris\'s title, "Mummy with a \nLong Member." \' His later name, Perceval, also meant a phallus, \nliterally "He Who Pierces (or penetrates) the Valley." 2 \n\nThe original myth of Peredur was an allegory of druidic initiation. \nHis adventures were staged as secret examinations, and he had to take \nan oath not to speak a single word to any Christian a detail that surely \nindicates pagan Mysteries. Peredur passed 21 days in the castle of the \nwitches of Caer Loyw to receive his instruction. In the women\'s "great \ncourt" he saw the Cauldron of Regeneration performing resurrec- \ntions of the Sons of the King of Suffering, near a sacred cave with a \nphallic pillar at its entrance. A man was killed each day. The women \nanointed the corpse and bathed it in the magic cauldron, and the man\'s \nlife was restored. Two sisters resembling the Gospels\' Mary and \nMartha gave Peredur bread and wine to serve the banquet table. This \nscene was not a copy of the Christian Last Supper; it came from older \nsources. It presaged primitive rites of the death and rebirth of the \nvegetation god, for whom the women wailed and in whose absence \nthe earth became a Waste Land.\' \n\nPeredur\'s chief instructress was his lady-love, "the most beautiful \ndamsel in the world," whose colors were those of the Triple Goddess \nin India: virgin white, maternal red, and the black of death. These \nremained the colors of the Maiden in many romances and fairy tales, \nsuch as "Snow White." (See Gunas.) The colors alone put Peredur \ninto a "trance of meditation" on his mysterious Shakti, for that was \nwhat she was. On saying farewell, she told him: "When thou seekest for \nme, seek in the direction of India." 4 \n\nSimilar instruction at the hands of a Shakti figured in the 12th- \ncentury Roman de Perceval, where the Welsh hero metamorphosed \ninto the Desired Knight sent to cure the world\'s ills, like a Saracen \nMahdi. It was claimed that Perceval would heal the lame Fisher King \nand restore the Waste Land to fertility. \n\nPerceval was hidden, like most versions of the Divine Child, and \nbrought up in secret by his mother. He happened to meet some \nknights, assumed they were angels, and followed them to King Arthur\'s \n\n\n\n784 \n\n\n\n:ourt. Despite his appearance as a clownish rustic, a lady prophesied Perceval \n\ni great destiny for him. ("Ladies" were the court seeresses.) Perceval \n\nisited the Grail castle and saw a vision of the holy vessel in the hands ^^^^^ \n\n|>f Queen Repanse de Joie (Dispenser of Joy). \n\nPerceval\'s instructress Blancheflor (White Flower) undertook to \neveal to him the secret meanings of chivalry, or the mysticism of \niove. Spiritual/sexual union with her made him invincible in battle, \nhowever, German versions of the legend recounted a battle between \nhe old pagan Perceval sustained by the power of sexual love and a new \nChristian Perceval sustained by celibacy. 5 Monkish authors worked \n>n the unfinished Roman de Perceval from before 1200 a.d. to about \n230, Christianizing the hero, who then discovered that the true \nneaning of chivalry was not what his lady-love taught at all but rather \nhe doctrines of the church. Blancheflor fell on hard times, mythically \nipeaking. She was vilified as "a Jewess named Blanchefleure" who \ntoupled with Satan at a witches\' sabbat and gave birth to Antichrist. 6 \n\nThe new Perceval was no longer a champion of women. He even \ntastrated himself in order to become one of the pure knights who \n\'believed in God perfectly." On one occasion he offered assistance to a \nlagan noblewoman whose property had been stolen. She served him \n. feast and invited him into her bed. Though sorely tempted, he caught \night of the cross formed by his sword hilt and thrust away the \n:nchantress. She vanished in a puff of black smoke. Perceval "rove \nkimself through the thigh" a classic metaphor for castration \naying, "Sithen my flesh will be my master I shall punish it. ... O good \n_,ord, take this in recompensation of that which I have done against \nhee. " 7 \n\nIn this way the phallic hero called Piercer of the Valley became the \nburest of pure knights, the only one worthy to see the Holy Grail \ntecause all other knights were polluted by love affairs or marriage. In \nPerceval\'s vision, "the old law" was represented as a woman riding a \nerpent, who a priest told him was a fiend. The woman asked Perceval \nb serve her, as the priest said, "to make thee believe on her and leave \npy baptism." Perceval refused. He made the sign of the cross and killed \n(he serpent. 8 \n\nIn a Cistercian romance, Perceval met the Queen of the Waste \njand, his aunt, living in poverty in the Waste Forest, though she had \n>nce been "the richest woman in the world." This indicates the \nikxldess, her temples robbed, and only her woodland groves left to \nler. Another female relative, Perceval\'s sister, arrived dead on Solo- \nnon\'s ship, the symbol of the church. She was nobly enshrined \n>ecause she had died a pure virgin, the monks\' notion of the only \nicceptable kind of woman. \n\nThere were no women involved in the Quest, any more than there \nvere women involved in setting policies for the church. 9 In this final \n\'ersion of the Grail myth, its feminine meaning had been written out of \nhe script, even though it was a prize sought by men. With this \n\n\n\n785 \n\n\n\nPen development, interest in the subject declined. Grail legends dwindled \n\nPersephone away for lack of further inspiration. The Christianized, virginized \n\nmm ^ t ^^^^^^^ mm Perceval seemed to lack charisma. He was a hero who pleased only th< \nmonks who invented him; ordinary folk found it difficult to sympa- \nthize with this singularly bloodless knight. \n\n1. Squire, 369. 2. Jung & von Franz, 185. 3.

The three deities succeeded each other \ncyclically like the three points of a turning triangle Demeter\'s symbol \nthe delta so that Kore and Persephone were often confused and \ncame to be considered the same Goddess. The fable about Kore- \nPersephone\'s abduction by Pluto was a later invention. She was \nQueen of the Underworld long before there was a masculinized Pluto. \nOrphic mystics worshipped her as Goddess of the blessed dead, to \nwhom they addressed formula prayers: "And now I come a suppliant t( \nthe Holy Persephone, that of her grace she receive me to the seats of \nthe Hallowed." Persephone answered, "Happy and blessed one, thou \nshalt be god instead of mortal." \' She held the keys to heaven and hell \n(Elysium and Tartarus), thus anticipating the Mithraic pater patrum an \nhis Christian counterpart Peter. 2 \n\nPersephone was considerably older than the Eleusinian myth of \nclassical writings, which told of her descent into the underworld and \nher annual return to the earth each spring. She was really another nami \nfor Hecate, or Hel, and had ruled the underworld as Destroying \nMother Kali ruled it under the name of Prisni, which may have been \nthe origin of Persephone\'s Etruscan name, Persipnei. Romans called \nher Proserpine. It was under this name that she passed into Christian \ntradition as a Queen of She-Demons. 5 Like Kali the Destroyer, she \nwas the basic Death-goddess from the beginning. \n\n1. Legge 1,133. 2.

One solitary passage in \nie Gospel of Matthew said Jesus made a pun by giving Simon son of \n>nah the new name of Peter, "Rock" (Latin petra), saying he would \nund his church on this rock (Matthew 16:18-19). \n\nUnfortunately for papal credibility, the so-called Petrine passage \nas a forgery. It was deliberately inserted into the scripture about the \nrd century a.d. as a political ploy, to uphold the primacy of the Roman \ne against rival churches in the east. 1 Various Christian bishoprics \nere engaged in a power struggle in which the chief weapons were \nibery, forgery, and intrigue, with elaborate fictions and hoaxes \nritten into sacred books, and ruthless competition between rival parties \n* the lucrative position of God\'s elite. 2 \n\nMost early churches put forth spurious claims to foundation by \nxwtles, even though the apostles themselves were no more than the \nlandatory "zodiacal twelve" attached to the figure of the sacred king, \narly popes were often mere names, drawn from titles of Roman \nxls, such as Eleutherios or Soter, falsely inserted into an artificial \nironology to simulate succession from Peter. But even Catholic \nholars now admit that the stories of Peter\'s upside-down crucifixion \nrfbre Nero, and burial in the Vatican hill, were fictitious. 3 \n\nThe real roots of Peter\'s legend lay in pagan Roman myths of the \nty-god called Petra, or Pater Liber, assimilated to the Mithraic pater \nitwm (Father of Fathers), whose title was corrupted into papa, then \nDope." 4 This personage had been both a Rock and a Father that \n, a phallic pillar in the Vatican mundus since Etruscan times, when \nracular priests called vatis gave their title to the site. Other variations \nthe deity\'s name were Patriarch (Chief Father), Pompeius, and \natricius (Patrick). 5 Like Indian Brahmans, Roman "patricians" \naimed a patrilineal descent from the god. Since his name also meant a \n\n\n\n787 \n\n\n\nPeter, Saint rock, he was what the Old Testament called "the Rock that begat \n\nthee" (Deuteronomy 32:18). \n^^^^^^^^^^^ The god\'s stone phallus remained planted in the Vatican mount \n\nthrough the later centuries of the Roman empire and well into the \nMiddle Ages perhaps even into the 19th century, when a visitor said \nVatican authorities "kept in secret a large stone emblem of the \ncreative power, of a very peculiar shape." 6 Medieval names for such an \nobject perron, pyr, pierre show that it was both a "rock" and a \n"peter." Such was the ancient Pater\'s phallic scepter or pillar topped \nwith a pine cone, the thyrsus of Pater Liber. Church authorities often \nconverted a carved perron into a Christian symbol simply by placing a \ncross on its tip. 7 \n\nPater Liber\'s perron appeared in St. Peter\'s Church of the 14th \ncentury a.d., atop the round temple called Pantheon, renamed St. \nMary Rotunda. The temple had been buried under an artificial hill \nforming the court of St. Peter\'s, probably because it was known as a \nshrine of the Goddess. Local legend said the phallic stone had been \n"carried off there by the devil on the night on which the Virgin \nbrought Christ into the world." 8 \n\nThis "devil" probably meant the Horned God Bacchus (Pater \nLiber), whose phallic staff called baculus was allegedly carried by St. \nPeter, though not by the popes. A strange, garbled legend explained the \nloss of the baculus. Peter gave it to the earth in order to raise a saint \n\ncalled Maternus from the grave. This legend evidently arose from the \ncult of Bacchus, who sent his phallic staff into the underworld, \n^^^^ sometimes in the form of an inverted "Peter\'s cross," to fertilize the \n\nmaternal soil. Hence the oddly-named Maternus who rose like \nvegetation from the ground. The bones of St. Maternus were said to lie \nPeter\'s Cross under the foundation of the First Church of the Martyrs in Cologne, \n\nbuilt by the Empress Helena in Maternus\'s honor, a typical confusion ol \nchronologies. 9 \n\nHowever garbled, the legend of Peter\'s baculus was perpetuated \nby Germanic emperors, who claimed Peter\'s staff had passed from \nthe popes to Germany, betokening Teutonic leadership of the Holy \nRoman Empire. 10 Other medieval legends presented Peter in the \npagan role of a fertilizing spirit. For instance, he was said to make a \nwoman conceive by giving her an apple or a pine cone, symbols of \nBacchus and his bride. 11 \n\nPeter or Petra combined with other phallic "rocks," such as the \nobelisk at the gate of the Egyptian after-world, sacred to Par, the title \nof Ra as "Lord of the Phallus." 12 This was also called Petra. A \n"prophet" of Ra incarnate in the savior Osiris was known as Petosiris; \nhis tomb near Hermopolis was a great pilgrimage center about 341 B.C. \nA Greek prayer addressed him: "I invoke Petosiris whose venerated \nbody here lies. Today he is among the gods, he is now united with the \nWise." King Nechepso was possessed by his spirit, which took him on \na typical shamanic "night journey" to heaven. 13 Greco-Egyptian scrip- \n\n\n\n788 \n\n\n\ntures written under the names of Nechepso and Petosiris were Peter, Saint \n\npopular in the 2nd century b.c. 14 \n\nLike the obelisk, a phallic pillar stood at nearly all the "Pearly ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nGates" of the Great Mother\'s temples, representing the Petra who \ndemanded the right passwords of initiates entering the temple, and the \nsame initiates after death entering heaven. Petra also guarded the \ngates of the year, through which the ChristosAeon passed. Thus Peter \nwas identified with Janus, god of gateways, and came to be called the \nJanitor, "Gatekeeper." 15 \n\nThe church\'s festival of St. Peter used to be held on the day of \nJanus, when the sun entered the sign of Aquarius, symbol of both the \ngate of the year and the Pearly Gate of Maria-Aphrodite. 16 Pagan \nprecedents naturally assimilated St. Peter to the position of guardian \nof the janua coeli, "gate of heaven," formerly a yonic emblem of the \nVirgin Juno. Robert de Borron\'s romance of the Grail even suggest- \ned that Peter stood for the gate of Jesus\'s tomb: Jesus was laid under a \npierre, a peter-stone, such as marked the graves of ancient phallic \nheroes. 17 \n\nAs gatekeeper, Peter inherited the mystical keys based on the \ntrident of Shiva and the Osirian ankh, called Key of the Nile and also \na heavenly key to the Nile in the Sky (the Milky Way). Key-holding \ndeities generally gave or denied admittance to the land of the dead, \nwhether it was located in the earth or in the heavens. The Book of \nEnoch described various keepers of the heavenly mansions as key- \nholders: one for the winds, one for the seasons, one for the gates of hell, \netc. 18 Prayers to the Goddess Persephone called her Holder of the \nKeys; or, alternatively, her consort Hades was the holder of the keys to \nheaven and hell. 19 \n\nOn such pagan precedents rested the crucial doctrine of the papal \nkeys, as stated in the interpolated Gospel passage: "I [Jesus] will give \nunto thee [Peter] the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever \nthou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever \nthou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19). \nThat is, holding the keys meant magic power. Whatever the key- \nholder commanded would come to be. This primitive idea underlay the \npowers of priests, bishops, popes, and the whole church organization. \nWithout the mystic keys, ecclesiastics\' blessings, cursings, baptisms, \nexorcisms, excommunications, prayers, or invocations were without \nefficacy. As Brahman priests commanded the gods by secret mantras, so \nChristian clergymen made the public believe the power of the keys \ncould cause God to act. \n\nThe Gospels suggest that Peter controlled even the Savior\'s \npassage through the holy gate. There is a ring of ritual about the story \nthat Peter denied Christ three times before the cock crew (Matthew \n26:34), as though some material of the ancient sacred drama were \nclumsily re-interpreted. The resurrected god couldn\'t enter into his \nkingdom until dawn. The angel of annunciation appeared as a cock, \n\n\n\n789 \n\n\n\nPeter, Saint \n\n\n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and geographer \nof the 2nd century \na.d. Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the \nancient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\n"to announce the coming of the Sun," as Pausanias said. 20 At cockcrow \nthe Savior arose as Light of the World to disperse the demons of \nnight. But if he tried to enter into his kingdom earlier, disrupting the \ncycles of night and day, the Gatekeeper would deny him. The \nritualistic denial took place also in the fertility cults of Canaan, where \nthe dying god Mot was denied by a priest representing the Heavenly \nFather. 21 \n\nThis story made difficulties for Christian theologians, when the \npagans inquired why Jesus should found his church on a disciple who \ndenied him instead of a more loyal one. The conventional answer was \nthat it demonstrated Christ\'s power of forgiveness. But during the \nlater persecutions, denial of Christ came to be considered the one \nabsolutely unforgivable crime. \n\nThe cock was another totemic "peter" sometimes viewed as the \ngod\'s alter ego. Vatican authorities preserved a bronze image of a \ncock with an oversize penis on a man\'s body, the pedestal inscribed \n"The Savior of the World." 22 The cock was also a solar symbol. Sun \nworship was evident in Christian literature, especially the "Gnostic \nGospel" of John. Mithraic solar symbolism entered into many papal \ncustoms. St. Peter\'s Chair, the papal throne, was decorated like the \nthrone of Mithra with zodiacal signs and the twelve labors of the sun \ngod. 23 \n\nAnother curious survival of the bird form of "Peter" was the water- \nwalking sea petrel, whose name meant "little peter." Petrels belonged \nto the legendary sea witch, Mother Carey, a corruption of Mater Cara, \nthe Latin Goddess Car or Ceres, "Mistress of Earth and Sea." \nEnglish sailors called the petrels Mother Carey\'s chickens, chicken \nbeing a diminutive of "cock," just as petrel was of "peter." 24 Like St. \nPeter, the petrels were "fishermen" who walked on water. Some said \nhowever that they were pagan souls who didn\'t reach hell before the \ngates were closed, and had to fly into "holes in the earth." 25 \n\nThe incident of Peter\'s water-walking (Matthew 14:29) was drawn \nfrom centuries of Oriental myth. Five hundred years before Chris- \ntians attributed this feat to Jesus and Peter, Buddhists were saying a sage \nproficient in yoga could walk on water. 26 Later medieval writers \nattributed the same miracle to various saints noted for asceticism. St. \nMaurus for example lived an especially pure life, and found himself \nable to walk on water after he was blessed by St. Benedict. 27 \n\nOther miracles attributed to Peter probably v/ere intended to \nprove that he truly possessed the power of the keys. Like Christ, he \ncould make the lame walk (Acts 3:7), and he could kill with a word, \nhis first victims being Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:5, 10). None of \nPeter\'s legends however suggest that he was a real person. Scriptures \nconcerning him were written (or forged) long after the epistles of \nPaul. 28 \n\nIt is now certain that there was no St. Peter in Rome to "found the \npapacy." 29 Stories about Peter were invented after the Roman see \n\n\n\n790 \n\n\n\nvas well established. During the first five centuries of the Christian era, \n10 one thought the bishop of Rome had a right to govern other \n>ishops; there was no such doctrine as the primacy of the Roman see. \n\'Christ neither founded nor desired the Church." 30 Indeed, the \nesus of the Gospels would have had no reason to found a church, since \nlis principal message was that the world was going to end almost at \njince. \n\nWhatever his origin, St. Peter stood for patriarchal opposition to \ne female principle, as shown by the Gnostic Gospels later censored \nut of the canon. The Dialogue of the Savior made the holy harlot \n4ary Magdalene the superior of all apostles; the Gospel of Mary said \nChrist loved her best, and gave her a secret revelation that Peter tried to \norce out of her. In the Pistis Sophia, Mary remarked, "Peter makes \ntie hesitate; I am afraid of him because he hates the female race." 31 \n\nMedieval legends also suggested Petrine anti-feminism. It was said \n>eter had a daughter, Petronilla (Little She-Peter), who was too \neautiful in Peter\'s opinion, so he prayed God to strike her with a fatal \nlness, and God complied. The Golden Legen d suggested that Peter \nsrtured women to exorcise them, as he caused them to vomit up the \nevils that possessed them, along with "much blood." 32 \n\nLegends aside, the real political power of the popes depended on \nopular acceptance of the doctrine of Peter\'s keys. Like a Brahman \nigh priest, the pope assumed absolute control of God, who would grant \nis vicar\'s slightest request. Thus invested with divine power on \narth, the pope became a figure comparable to the ancient god-kings, \n/orshipped with similar subservience and inclined toward a similar \nrrogance. 33 \n\nPope Innocent III set papal policy with a proclamation that "the \nord left to Peter the governance not of the church only, but of the \n/hole world." 34 Innocent was not content with the title "Vicar of \nhrist" but had it changed to "Vicar of God." 35 The bull Unam \nhnctam of Pope Boniface VIII stated that every human creature on \narth must be "subjected to the Roman pontiff." 36 In his jubilee year, \nloniface represented himself as the emperor of all Europe. He dressed \nlis cardinals as Roman priests, and himself in imperial armor, \nreclaiming, "I am the emperor; I am the Augustus." 37 \n\nBoniface came to power by tricking his simple-minded, 80-year- \nld predecessor Celestine into abdicating the throne. Boniface had \n^destine imprisoned in the fortress of Fumone, and had him mur- \nered, rumor said, by driving a nail into his head. Boniface\'s enemies \nherished as a holy relic Celestine\'s alleged skull, with a hole in it. \nloniface had many enemies because he used papal power to seize \ninds and towns of the wealthy Colonna family, to give them to his own \nimily, the Gaetani. Encountering resistance from the Colonnas, \nloniface preached crusades against them and plunged Italy into a \nloody civil war. He beseiged the Colonna city of Palestrina and \nffered to return half the enemy\'s possessions if the city were given up; \n\n\n\nPeter, Saint \n\n\n\nGospel of Mary \n\nOne of the early \nGnostic Gospels, \nonce included with the \nbooks of the New \nTestament but later \neliminated from the \ncanon. A copy was \nrediscovered in the \n1940s at Nag Hammadi. \n\n\n\n791 \n\n\n\nPhaedra but he broke his promise. Once it was in his hands, he had Palestrina \n\nrazed, its palaces, libraries, and treasure-houses sacked, its ground \n\n^ w ^^ m plowed and sown with salt. One of the Colonnas survived and \neventually assassinated Boniface. 58 \n\nA similarly avaricious heir of St. Peter was the highly inclement \npope Clement VII, nicknamed "the Butcher" because of his fond- \nness for massacre. He promised the mutinous people of Bologna that hi \nwould "wash his hands and feet in their blood." 39 At Cesena in 1376 \nhe offered mercy to the city, then killed five thousand of its citizens. \nThere were uprisings against him. Mobs hounded him out of Rome \nand Naples, crying, "Death to the Antichrist! Death to Clement and hi \ncardinals!" 40 \n\nOver all, the heirs of St. Peter have tended to follow the general \npattern of dictators, some less benevolent than others. If they had any \nquality in common, it was acquisitiveness. This appeared so consistently \nthat the Renaissance popes made it a heresy to say Jesus and Peter \nwere poor men. Visiting Rome in 1511, Martin Luther was so shocked \nby the decadent luxury of the papal court that he wrote: "If there is a \nhell, then Rome is built upon it. . . . Tiberius, the heathen Emperor, \neven if he were such a monster as Suetonius writes of, is nevertheless \nan angel in comparison with the present court of Rome. The same hat! \nto serve the supper table twelve naked girls." 41 It was rather a contrast \nwith the popular image of twelve apostles. \n\nl.Reinach,240. 2. H. Smith, 252. 3. Attwater, 274. 4. H.

Phaethon \nommitted the crime of hubris, offended his jealous Father, and was cast \nown from heaven like a lightning bolt. \n\nPhaethon tricked his father Helios-Apollo into allowing him to \nrive the solar chariot across the sky, playing the role of the great God \nimself. But Phaethon lacked his father\'s skill. He lost control of the \norses and nearly set the world afire with his reckless driving. His \nither threw him down into the sea just in time to save the earth from \neing ignited by the fiery sun-chariot. 1 \n\nPhaethon\'s myth didn\'t originate in Greece. It was an old tale from \nLhodes, the Island of the Sun, where white horses and a burning \nhariot were annually thrown into the sea to propitiate the Hittite sun \nod Tesup, whose cult had replaced that of the Moon-goddess \n)anae. 2 It seems likely that in primitive times there was also a charioteer \nlaying the role of Phaethon and giving up his life for the sake of a \nost-mortem godhood. \n\nI.

Lindsay, A.W., 131. \n\n\n\nhallus Worship \n\nLs Goddess-dominated religions made the yoni their holiest symbol, \n3 God-dominated religions adored the phallus. Patriarchal Semites \nworship ped their own genitals, and swore binding oaths by placing a \n\n\n\n793 \n\n\n\nPhallus Worship hand on each other\'s private parts, a habit still common among the \n\nArabs. 1 Words like testament, testify, and testimony still attesf to the \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m oaths sworn on the testicles. 2 \n\nAbraham\'s servant swore by placing his hand "under the thigh" of \nhis master (Genesis 24, 9) because "thigh" was a common euphe- \nmism for "penis," used in superstitious fear of mentioning the divine \norgan directly. Myths of male pseudo-birth like Zeus\'s fatherhood \nof Dionysus made the offspring come forth from the father\'s \n"thigh." 3 But the meaning was "penis," as in the Hindu myth that \nsubstituted the lingam for the yoni: the god Sukra (Seed) came out of \nthe stomach of the Great God by way of his penis. 4 \n\nAnother Middle-Eastern euphemism for "penis" was "knee," \ngenu, so often mentioned that some people came to believe the knee \nwas the source of seminal fluid. A father used to establish paternal rights \nto a child by setting the infant on his knee, which is why "genuine" \n(of the knee) came to mean "legitimate." In Mesopotamia the word \nbirku meant both "knee" and "penis." 5 In Latin it became virtu, \n"masculine spirit, virility, erect-ness." \n\nThe Bible calls Jacob\'s penis the sinew that shrank, lying "upon \nthe hollow of the thigh." Scholars have tried to interpret this limp \npenis as something else: a severed tendon, or a certain thigh muscle, \nwhich Jews were forbidden to eat (Genesis 32:32). But medieval \ntranslators frankly recognized the phallic meaning of the "sinew." They \nsaid the god-man\'s blighting touch on Jacob\'s shrunken member was \n"to cool the fires of concupiscence." 6 \n\nBiblical patriarchs worried inordinately about the vulnerability of \nthe penis and avoided direct mention of it lest evil spirits be drawn to \nit. Old Testament laws reveal a special fear of women\'s power over the \npenis. God\'s commandment was that a woman who grabs a man\'s \ngenitals must have her hand cut off, even if she does it to defend her \nhusband against an enemy (Deuteronomy 25:1 1-12). \n\nThe word "fascinate" is a relic of men\'s belief in the magic of their \nown genitals. Latin fascinum meant an erect penis (presumably \n"fascinating" to the opposite sex), especially in the form of a phallic \namulet. Such amulets continued to be used through the Middle Ages \nas antidotes to the evil eye. 7 In the 8th century a.d., the church forbade \nmen to pray to the fascinum. In the 9th century, the same prohibition \nhad to be repeated and again in the 12th and 1 3 th centuries, showing \nthat the custom went blithely on. 8 \n\nThe phallic principle was covertly worshipped in sacred posts and \npillars, such as the Maypole and the "bride-stake" erected at wed- \ndings, about which "the guests were wont to dance as about a \nMay-pole." 9 Stubbes in 1 583 described common folk dancing and \nhanging garlands on their Maypole, which he called a "stinking idol." 10 \nWomen of ancient Rome used to hang flower wreaths on the erect \npenis of the god Liber, to "have fruit of the seeds they sow," St. Augus- \ntine said. 11 \n\n\n\n794 \n\n\n\nThe same sexual ceremony of encircling the phallus with a female Phallus Worship \n\nwreath was perpetuated at Antwerp, where an ancient ithyphallic \n\nstatue of Priapus stood before the sanctuary of St. Walpurga, once the ^^^_-^^^^^_ \norgiastic Goddess of Walpurgisnacht or May Eve. Each year at the \nIspring festival, women hung wreaths of flowers on Priapus\'s penis. 12 \nAnother image of the same god was carried through the streets of \n(Naples in sacred processions, displaying a penis long enough to reach \nis chin. This excrescence was known as ilsanto membro, the Holy \n\nember. 13 \n\nA 1 3th-century Chronicle of Lanercost said that, at Easter, the \n\nrish priest of Inverkeithing "revived the profane rites of Priapus, \n\nllecting young girls from the villages, and compelling them to dance \n\ncircles to Father Bacchus. When he had these females in a troop, \nut of sheer wantonness, he led the dance, carrying in front on a poje a \nepresentation of the human organs of reproduction, and singing and \nancing himself like a mime." H This priest was less eccentric than one \nWiight think; the same sort of thing was happening all over Europe. \nPhallus worship was Christianized in ways that hinted at Christianity\'s \nkrue nature: a cult of the male principle. \n\nGiant phalli were adored up to the 17th century as saints, such as \nEutropius, Foutin, Guerlichon, Gilles, Regnaud, Rene, and Gui- \nknole. St. Foutin de Varailles was a phallic pillar kept red with libations \npf wine, as the phalli of Shiva were constantly reddened in Hindu \ntemples. 15 Ithyphallic saints in Normandy and Anjou were believed to \nImpregnate women who lay with them all night. The image of St. \npuignole had a large erect penis from which women scraped splinters as \nconception charms. So much scraping went on that the saint might \npave had his holy member whittled away entirely. But the priests, with \ncommendable foresight, made his phallus of a wooden rod that \npassed all the way through the statue to the back, where it was hidden by \na screen, and could be periodically thrust forward by a tap of a mallet \nas it diminished in front. 16 \n\nChrist assumed the role of a phallic god in providing the most \npopular of conception charms: the Holy Prepuce or more accurate- \ny, Prepuces, for there were hundreds of them in Renaissance churches. \n\\t least thirteen examples still survive. 17 All had the power to make \nvomen conceive. The most celebrated of the virile foreskins, housed at \nhe Abbey Church in Chartres, was credited with thousands of \nniraculous pregnancies. 18 St. Catherine of Siena went so far as to claim \nhat Jesus used his holy foreskin as her wedding ring. She was bound \no Jesus as his bride, "not with a ring of silver but with a ring of his holy \nlesh, for when he was circumcised just such a ring was taken from his \nloly body." 19 \n\nPhallic saints were special patrons of virility, much entreated by \nnen with sexual problems. Sir William Hamilton described the cult \n)f two phallic saints, Cosmo and Damiano, at Isernia in 1781: "Ex-voti \n)f wax, representing the male parts of generation, of various dimensions \n\n\n\n795 \n\n\n\nPhallus Worship ... are publicly offered for sale. . . . The Vow is never presented with- \n\nout being accompanied by a piece of money, and is always kissed by th \n\n^ ^_ devotee at the moment of presentation." The priests sold St. Cosmo\'s \nholy oil as a virility charm: \n\nThe oil of St. Cosmo is in high repute for its invigorating quality, when \nthe loins, and parts adjacent, are anointed with it. No less than 1400 Has! \nof that oil were either expended at the Altar in unctions, or charitably \ndistributed during the Fete in the year 1 780; and as it is usual for \neveryone, who either makes use of the Oil at the Altar, or carries off a Us \nof it, to leave an alms for St. Cosmo, the ceremony of the Oil becomes \nlikewise a very lucrative one for the Canons of the Church. 20 \n\nA hint of the broad extent of phallic Christianity in England \nappeared after World War II when Professor Geoffrey Webb, of the \nRoyal Commission on Historical Monuments, investigated a bomb- \ndamaged altar of an old church and found a large stone phallus within \nFurther researches showed that the altars of approximately 90% of \nEnglish churches built before 1 348 had hidden stone phalli. 21 By paga: \ntradition, an altar symbolized the female body which is why witches \nwere said to use a naked woman for their altar and the phallus within \nit obviously represented the Hidden God. \n\nSexual symbolism kept cropping up to embarrass scholars of \nreligion, like Georges Dumezil, who called "indiscreet" the Roman \nbelief that the sacred Palladium in the temple of Vesta was the scepter \nof Priam "in the likeness of a male sex organ." Yet Dumezil himself \nwrote, "Some day it will be necessary to restore to the history of \nreligions the idea of the symbol which is today so underrated and yet \nof such capital importance." 22 \n\nAn understanding of phallus worship is important for comprehen- \nsion of religious psychology, especially the fundamental insecurity of \nmale self-worship: for the phallic God was useless without the Goddess \nDr. Lederer says: \n\nDuring the aeons of feminine dominance, women were well content in \nthe possession of their own particular magic, and did not envy men \ntheir little tool that was so easily borrowed when it was needed. Indeed, \nthe Great Mother was never short of a phallus . . . the phallus was at \nher service. It was kept in evidence in the sanctuary of the Goddess, and \nwas not the phallus of any particular God or mortal, was not a man or a \nGod with a phallus, but it was simply a phallus per se, a depersonalized \ninstrument of ready and convenient use. Once used, it was no longer \nuseful. For the Great Mother, as for certain of her descendants today, \npenises are expendable: one can always get more, and the new ones are \nprobably better. The new ones, of course, are younger; and the fear of \nbeing spent, and doomed to replacement by a younger man both in . \nthe sexual and in the general service of the Goddess may on occasion b \na source of deep anxiety for the middle-aged male. 2 * \n\nPhallic anxiety was evident in all patriarchal systems, where fear \n\n\n\n796 \n\n\n\nof the devouring vulva led to both ascetic avoidance and persecution of Phallus Worship \n\nwomen. Phallic anxiety was the keynote of the one solitary joke in the \n\nMalleus MaleHcarum (Hammer for Witches), the Inquisition\'s official i^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhandbook. The monkish authors took the joke seriously, though it \n\nwas given them by some sly peasant whose purpose was mockery. The \n\nstory was that a witch stole a man\'s penis, but he caught her and \n\nforced her to reveal its whereabouts. She told him to climb a tall tree \n\nand look in a nest, which proved to be filled with penises. He chose \n\nthe biggest one, but the witch said he couldn\'t have that one; it \n\nbelonged to the parish priest. \n\nThe pious authors swallowed all this with great solemnity, and \nwrote: "What is to be thought of those witches who in this way \nsometimes collect male organs in great numbers, as many as twenty or \nthirty members together, and put them in a bird\'s nest, or shut them \nup in a box, where they move themselves like living members, and eat \noats and corn, as has been seen by many and is a matter of common \nreport?" 24 Even more to the point, what is to be thought of those \nchurchmen who believed it? \n\nPhallus worship often slid over the ill-defined line into homosex- \nuality, which was inevitable among men taught to adore the phallic \nprinciple in each other. Sometimes a homosexual kind of adoration was \nextended toward the superior male, or toward God. Among gypsy \nmen, the expression of ritual self-abasement was hav co kar, "I eat thy \npenis." It was explained that "If one should, for example, petition \nGod in prayer for a wish to be granted, he would precede his request by \nsaying, \'O God, I eat thy penis.\' " As with other eaten gods however, \n"the question whether it might be the last remnant of a very ancient \npractice of cannibalism must be considered." 25 \n\nPhallus worship is still evident in the symbols and sayings of the \nmodern world, though its meaning is less like impregnation and more \nlike death. Guns, cannon, missiles and other weapons are the phallic \nsymbols. In underworld slang, "to get a hard-on" means to pull a \ngun. 26 "Hits" and "scores" describe both attacks and sexual encounters. \nDominant men are "big shots" or "big guns." The ancient image of \nthe fructifying Lord of Life is unhappily transformed into a Lord of \nDeath when male power is identified with the power to destroy. In its \nworship of the masculine principle of aggression, the modern world \nsorely misses the central idea of ancient Goddess worship: that true \npower is the power to preserve. \n\n1.

Pillar \n\n\n\nPillar \n\n\n\nThe obelisk, Maypole, pillar, sacred tree trunk, upright cross, and \nother male divinity-symbols probably originated in India where Shiva\'s \nlingam (penis) was worshipped as a sacred pillar. Shiva\'s title Sthanu, \n"the Pillar," revealed him as a personified phallus. 1 Some of his holy \npillars are still popular pilgrimage centers. Land within a radius of \n100 cubits from such a pillar became known as the Kingdom of Shiva, \nwhere many miracles occur, including instant remission of sins. 2 \nSeasonal festivals still feature a Maypole representing Shiva\'s "Great \nLingam." 3 \n\nPhallic pillars appear also in northern Asia and Siberia, where such \nerections are entitled Powerful Posts of the Center of the City, or \nMan-Pillar of Iron. People pray to such pillars, calling them "Man" or \n"Father," offering them blood sacrifices. 4 \n\nBlood was anciently considered essential to the lingam-pillar, \nwhich Hindus frequently painted red or smeared with blood. Archaic \nEgyptian myth said two pillars, called "trees that shed blood," stood at \nthe entrance of the temple. The blood they shed could render \nwomen pregnant. 5 Here may be found a remnant of the primitive idea \nthat male blood, not semen, is the fertile essence, copied from \nNeolithic worship of female "moon-blood." The temple door repre- \nsented the yoni, entitled Er-per, the Holy Door of the Goddess. 6 \n\nAs in India, where Shiva\'s lingam was painted red or anointed with \nblood for religious festivals, so in Egypt the pillars in front of the \ntemple door were "blooded" in memory of primitive sacrifices when \nreal men were hung on them to bleed. Jews picked up this Egyptian \ncustom and blooded their doorposts for Passover with the vital fluid of \nthe sacrificial lamb. The doorposts represented phalli, like the pillars \nin front of Solomon\'s temple, named Boaz and Jachin, "Strength" and \n"God Makes Him Firm" (1 Kings 7:19-20). \n\nAt Hierapolis the temple of the Goddess had an enormous phallic \npillar on each side of the door. Every year, a man climbed to the top \nof each pillar and remained there for seven days, symbolically recapitu- \nlating ancient sacrifices when the pillars were bathed in the blood of \nhuman victims, who were evidently left hanging for one lunar week, \nperhaps in imitation of a menstrual period. 7 When Syria was Chris- \ntianized, the custom was continued by the "pillar saints" who, like their \npagan predecessors, thought themselves near enough to heaven for \ntheir prayers to be distinctly heard. 8 The most famous of them was St. \nSimeon Stylites, "Simeon of the Pillar," who stayed aloft until his \nlimbs became gangrenous and he died in a pungent odor of sanctity. 9 \n\nA church was built around a sacred pillar in Athens and named St. \n\n\n\n799 \n\n\n\nai \n\n\n\nPithos John of the Column. As pagans had previously come to tie their \n\nPlanetary Spheres illnesses to the pillar with silk thread, so the legendary St. John ordered \n\n^ ^^ m ^^^ "Let any sick come and tie a silk thread to the column and be \n\nhealed." 10 \n\nPillars in conjunction with churches as a spire or campanile \n\nnot often recognized as male symbols in contact with a female one, \n\nalthough the shikhara or spire associated with a Hindu temple is \n\ngenerally viewed as a phallus. 11 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty.354. 2.

The identity of the Great \nMother with this vessel of rebirth and regeneration was an idea \ncommon to most ancient cultures, where the manufacture of pots and \nvases of all kinds was usually the business of women. 1 \n\nIn Christian custom the pithos was transformed into the pyx or \n"box" that enclosed the body of Christ; and Erasmus confused the \ntwo vessels in translating the patriarchal version of Pandora\'s myth. \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 132-33. \n\n\n\nPlanetary Spheres \n\nThe Chaldean astrological cosmology was generally accepted \nthroughout the Mediterranean world in the early Christian era. Accord \ning to this cosmology, the earth lay under a series of nested, inverted j \ncrystal bowls, turned independently of each other by star-angels. This \nidea accounted for the independent movement of sun, moon, and \nplanets against the fixed stars. Each "sphere" had its tutelary deities. In \nEgypt these were known as the Seven Heavenly Midwives, emana- \ntions of Hathor, who guarded the seven gates of heaven. Souls seeking \nentrance must address them with hekau, words of power. The first of \nthem was greeted: "Lady of tremblings, surrounded by lofty walls, the \nchieftainess, lady of destruction, the disposer of the words that drive \naway storms and deliver from destruction him that traveleth along the \nway." 1 \n\nUnder the earth lay the celestial spheres\' mirror image, seven \nnether spheres descending into the Abyss. These divisions of the \nunderworld were called Seven Recesses, Seven Gates, abysses, bothroi, \nantra, mychoi, pylai, or chasma (pits). 2 At the bottom lay the \n\n\n\n800 \n\n\n\n"oundations of the earth, "the meeting of the mighty waters." Like the Planetary Spheres \n\n.elestial gates, the underworld gates were guarded by special porters, \n\nhe Assyro-Babylonian maskim or Anunnaki. Ziggurats were models of ^^^^_-^^^^_ \n\nihe upper and lower planetary spheres. Ascending heavens were \n\nepresented by the terraces of the ziggurat, known as the Stages of the \n\nSeven Spheres of the World. 3 Underneath, inside the temple, were \n\neven corresponding "deeps" or "pits." \n\nInitiations in the temple apparently mimicked the descent into the \ninderworld pits and a journey through the heavenly stages also. \n\\puleius described his initiation into the Mysteries of Isis as a descent \nnto the land of death, to the threshold of Isis-Nephthys, or Persepho- \nle the Destroyer. He beheld the Black Sun, nether image of the solar \n;od. Then he ascended through the lower and upper worlds and saw \nface to face" the deities of both. Finally he rose to the heights and was \nxhibited to the congregation in the costume of the sun god. 4 The \nourney of each initiate was a theatrical performance, with priests and \nriestesses wearing the costumes and masks of the appropriate spirits, \nnd dramatic descents through dark caves and other specially decorated \nooms. The impressive effects may well be imagined. \n\nEarly Christians believed all souls descended from heaven to enter \nleir bodies of flesh on earth, during the descent taking faults and \nassions from each sphere to sully their initial purity and cause tempta- \non. This was the origin of the Seven Deadly Sins. "As the souls \nescend, they draw with them the torpor of Saturn, the wrathfulness of \n/lars, the concupiscence of Venus, the greed for gain of Mercury, \nie lust for power of Jupiter; which things effect a confusion in the \njuls, so that they can no longer make use of their own power and \nleir proper faculties." 5 After living the right sort of life, the soul could \nj-ascend after death, shedding its sinful qualities one by one. 6 \nometimes the spirits of the planetary spheres acted as inspectors after \nie Egyptian manner: "As men ascend, they find custom-houses \nuarding the way with great care and obstructing the soaring souls, each \nustom-house examining for one particular sin, one for deceit, \nnother for envy, another for slander, and so on in order, each passion \naving its own inspectors and assessors." 7 \n\nGnostic mystery-cults copied the pagans, in that they taught \nasswords and charms to propitiate the guardian spirits of each \n)here. In the Pistis Sophia, Jesus told his followers: "Stay not your \nand until ye find the cleansing mysteries which will cleanse you so \ni to make you pure light, that ye may go into the heights and inherit \nie light of my kingdom." 8 The heights meant the Empyrean, where \nk)d lived in the highest heaven. Those who attained true enlighten- \nlent would enter the Godhead and become God, just as Oriental \niges believed they could enter Nirvana and become one with the \nlfinite. 9 In China, the successively higher heavens were even \nraphically illustrated by the multiple roofs of the pagoda, one above \nlother. 10 \n\n\n\n801 \n\n\n\nPleiades The days of the week are still named after the planetary spheres. \n\nMonday is the Day of the Moon (dies lunae). Tuesday is Tiw\'s Day, \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ named for the Saxon god who was the counterpart of Mars; it is the Day \nof Mars in Latinate languages (French mardi). Wednesday is Wo- \nden\'s Day, dies mercurii, named for the Teutonic god considered the \nequivalent of Mercury. The once-supreme Woden was ousted from \nthe list in the very country of his origin, Germany, and replaced by a \nneutral Mittwoch, "Mid-week." \n\nThor\'s Day was named for the thunder-god who was a Germanic \nequivalent of Jove; Romans called it diesjovis. Friday was Freya\'s \nDay (Frea-Tag), Rome\'s dies veneris, the day sacred to Venus-Aphro- \ndite-Freya the only wholly feminine day, which may be why so \nmany superstitions were connected with it. The Goddess\'s day was \nfollowed by Saturn\'s Day, then by the Day of the Sun (dies soh\'s), \nassociated with the "fiery" heaven of aether. \n\nAs the planets ruled various divisions of heaven, so also they were \nbelieved to rule various places on earth according to their qualities. \nUnder the sun were "light places, the serene air, kings\' palaces and \nprinces\' courts, pulpits, theatres, thrones, and all kingly and magnifi- \ncent places." Under the moon were "wildernesses, highways, groves, \nwoods, rocks, hills, mountains, forests, fountains, waters, rivers, seas, \nseashores, ships, and granaries for corn." Under Mars were "fiery and \nbloody places, furnaces, bakehouses, shambles, places of execution, \nand places where there have been great battles fought and slaughters \nmade." Under Mercury were "shops, schools, warehouses, ex- \nchanges for merchants." Under Jupiter were "all privileged places, \nconsistories of noblemen, tribunals, chairs, places for exercise, \nschools, and all beautiful and clean places, and those sprinkled with \ndivers odors." Under Venus were "pleasant fountains, green mead- \nows, flourishing gardens, garnished beds, stews, the sea, the seashore, \nbaths, dancing places, and all places belonging to women." Under \nSaturn were "all stinking places, and dark, underground, religious, and \nmournful places, as church-yards, tombs, and houses not inhabited by \nmen; and old, tottering, obscure, dreadful houses; and solitary dens, \ncaves, and pits; also fish-ponds, standing pools, sewers." 11 \n\n\\.BookoftheDcnd,27\\-72. 2.

The importance attached to this small \ngroup of dim stars seems out of proportion to their apparent \ninsignificance. \n\nThe sacrifice of the Mexican savior Xipe Totec, Our Lord the \nFlayed One, took place on the Hill of the Stars at the moment when \n\n\n\n802 \n\n\n\nthe Pleiades reached the zenith on the last night of the Great Year Pleiades \n\ncycle. It was thought if the Sisters were not propitiated by the \n\nsacrifice, the universe would fall to pieces and the world would come to ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nan end. 1 \n\nPre-Vedic India also attached sacrificial significance to the Pleia- \ndes, called Seven Mothers of the World, or Krittikas, "razors" or \n"cutters." They were also seven priestesses who "judged" men a \ncognate was Greek kritikos, "judge" and sometimes "critically" \nwounded them, for their razors were castrating moon-sickles. The fire \ngod Agni copulated with the Seven Mothers while they were men- \nstruating, the usual Tantric rite later outlawed by the Vedic priesthood. \nThey gave birth to a solar hero enveloped in a great red cloud \n(female symbol) penetrated by bolts of lightning (male symbol). The \nhero was sacrificially slain, wounded in the side with a spear, and \nfrom his body sprang his reincarnation, another hero like himself. 2 In \nthis myth may be discerned rites of great antiquity, predating the \ndiscovery of fatherhood, when blood was the essence of generation. \n\nThe Pleiades were prominent in the early cult of Aphrodite, who \nwas supposed to have given birth to them under her name of Pleione. \nAphrodite was a castrating Crone-goddess as well as a Holy Dove; and \nthe Pleiades were "a flock of doves." 3 They were connected with \nsacrificial New Year ceremonies in Greece as in central America and \nsoutheastern Asia. The Seven Sisters stood at the zenith on New \nYear\'s Eve as if to select the god of the new Aeon. Old Babylonian texts \nbegan the year with the Pleiades. Later, the zodiacal sign of the New \nYear became Aries, the Ram. 4 \n\nEgyptian texts allude to the Pleiades\' archaic significance as \nKrittikas, judges of men, assigning them also to seven planetary \nspheres as the seven Hathors. The dead had to speak the names of these \nGoddesses to pass their "critical" examinations and enter paradise: \n"Hail, ye seven beings who make decrees, who support the Balance on \nthe night of the judgment of the Utchat, who cut off heads, who hack \nnecks in pieces, who take possession of hearts by violence and rend the \nplaces where hearts are fixed, who make slaughterings in the Lake of \nFire, I know you, and I know your names; therefore know ye me, even \nas I know your names." 5 The reference to tearing out hearts is \nremarkably evocative of Aztec religious customs. The Seven Mothers \nWho Make Decrees appeared also in Arabia as Seven Sages or \nimams (from ima, "mother"). 6 \n\nIn classical mythology the Pleiades represented the Maytime feast \nof life and the November feast of death at opposite points of the year. \nThey were emanations of the Moon-goddess "who was worshipped at \nthe two solstices as the Goddess of alternatively Life-in-Death and \nDeath-in-Life and who early in November, when the Pleiades set, sent \nthe sacred king his summons to death." 7 Prayers for the dead were \nrecited before the Pleiades on November 1 , which became All Soul\'s \nDay. 8 \n\n\n\n803 \n\n\n\nPluto Greeks said the leader of the Pleiades was the Dove-goddess \n\nAlcyone, the "halcyon" bird who brought good weather for the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ planting season. Another Pleiad was Electra, mother of Dardanus, \nlegendary founder of Troy, whose name is still preserved in the \nDardanelles. Another Pleiad was Merope, "Bee-eater," a title of Aphro^ \ndite\'s queen bee as devourer of the drone. Some said Merope was \none of the Furies; others said she married the doomed sun-hero \nSisyphus. Still another Pleiad was Maia "the Maker" or the "Grand- \nmother," mother of Hermes the Enlightened One, as her Hindu \ncounterpart Maya mothered Buddha the Enlightened One. 9 \n\nClassical writers seemed anxious to disguise the real nature of the \nPleiades. One story insisted they were all virgins. Orion the Hunter \ntried to rape them, but Zeus protected them by turning them into doves \nand placing them in the heavens. The story was obviously absurd, as \nall the Pleiades had lovers or husbands, and three of them had mated \nwith Zeus himself. In earlier myths, Orion the Hunter was their \nvictim, not their attacker. The Huntress of the Seven Stars, Artemis, \nshot him to death in the sea, suggesting that victims were sometimes \nriddled with arrows then consigned to the deep. 10 \n\nArtemis personified another set of seven stars, the much larger \nconstellation Ursa Major, the "Great She-Bear," who may have been \nanother version of the Seven Sisters. Artemis and Aphrodite both were \nassociated with ancient cults of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, seven \nmantic priestesses of Seven-Gated Thebes, where the Seven Hathors \nonce ruled, where sacred kings were slain every seventh year, and \nwhere Teiresias was castrated and lived seven years as a temple woman. \nThe same magic seven were called Seven Midwives in Egypt and the \nOrient. They were probably represented in pre-patriarchal Jerusalem by \nthe holy Menorah (seven-branched candlestick) symbolizing the \nsevenfold Men-horae or Moon-priestesses, as shown by its female- \ngenital decorations, lilies and almonds (Exodus 25:33). \n\nMedieval superstitions betrayed fear of groups of seven females, \nperhaps a relic of ancient images of the Sisters. East Frieslanders \nbelieved that in any family of seven sisters, one of the seven was sure to \nbe a vampire or a werewolf. 11 The sevenfold grouping could also be \narranged in a vertical line of descent, e.g. in the ubiquitous belief that a \nseventh daughter of a seventh daughter was always a witch. \n\nI.

"This is the good end of those \nvho have attained gnosis: to become God." \' See Antinomianism. \nA medieval prophet named Giovanni Mercurio da Correggio \nissimilated himself to Poimandres who seems to have been, in this \n:ontext, a reincarnation of Jesus.

Hellenic mythographers said both Kore and \n\nEurydice were detained in the underworld because they ate pome- \ngranate seeds there. Nana, virgin mother of the savior Attis, conceived \nhim by eating either a pomegranate seed or an almond, another yonic \nsymbol. \n\nThe Bible says the pillars of Solomon\'s temple were ornamented \nwith the female-genital symbols of lilies and pomegranates (1 Kings \n7:18-20). Solomon himself impersonated the phallic god Baal-Rim- \nmon, "Lord of the Pomegranate," when he was united with his divine \nbride, the mysterious Shulamite, and drank the juice of her pomegran- \nate (Song of Solomon 8:2). \n\nArgive Hera was worshipped as Our Lady With the Pomegranate \nat Capaccio Vecchio near Paestum, formerly a Sybarite colony called \nPoseidonia. In ancient times the people laid at the Goddess\'s feet \nofferings of little boats filled with flowers, as she sat enthroned with her \nchild on one arm, a pomegranate in her other hand, inviting contemph \ntion of the miracle of her bringing forth life. About the 12th century \na.d. the people of Paestum built her a new shrine, to which pilgrimages \nare made to this day. There sits Our Lady With the Pomegranate still, \nenthroned with her child on one arm, a pomegranate in her other \nhand. 2 The people lay at her feet offerings of little boats filled with \nflowers. \n\nHera was Mother Earth, and the suit of pentacles in the Tarot \npack represented the earth element. Therefore it is not surprising to \nfind this suit transformed in some medieval packs into a Suit of \nPomegranates, the fruit always opened in an oval orifice to show its \nmoist red interior. 5 \n\n1.

He was "greedy of Possession \n\nearthly kingdoms" that is, his priests were and so his myths tell how "^^^^^^^"" \n\nhe took territories from various forms of the Goddess. He pretended \n\nto marry the Triple Goddess herself, under her name of Amphitrite, \n\nand demoted her to a mere sea nymph. He tried to take Argolis from \n\nHera, and Athens from Athene. He claimed to have invented the horse \n\nbridle, though Athene had already done it. He demanded that \n\nwomen be deprived of their vote in Athens, and forbade men to \n\ncontinue taking the surnames of their mothers as they had formerly \n\ndone. 1 He even claimed husbandship of the venerable Mare-Demeter \n\non the ground that he had once raped her in the form of a stallion. \n\nYet Poseidon was an upstart god, transparently subject to the \nGoddess in his earlier myths. "He had, properly speaking, no name \nof his own, but was simply known as \'the spouse of Earth.\' He only \nbecame a great god when his original nature, and also the origin of \nhis name, were forgotten." 2 \n\nWhen Poseidon sent a flood on the Xanthian plain, the Xanthian \nwomen beat him off and saved their country by hoisting their skirts \nand marching on him with their genitals exposed.

Graves, CM. 1, 254. \n\n\n\nPossession \n\nThe idea that a human body may be possessed by a supernatural \npersonality, in addition to its own natural one, occurs in every religion. \nChristians believed in several kinds of possession, both divine and \ndemonic. The Catholic church retains the office of exorcist because it \nstill considers demonic possession real. At the same time, god- \npossession was the central idea of Christ\'s incarnation, and it is believed \nthat a worshipper may be possessed by the spirit of Christ, often in \nthe ecstatic manner of the primitive shaman. Some Christian sects \ncalled this "getting the spirit." \n\nPagan mystery cults brought about god-possession by eating the \ngod (as did Christians also), and by initiatory rites and formulae. The \nMithraic initiate said he was "rendered immortal in this hour by the \ngood will of God in his abounding goodness . . . that I may be \ninitiated and that the Holy Spirit may breathe within me." A Hermetic \npapyrus prayed the god to enter into the worshipper, "for thou art I \n\nand I am thou I know thee, Hermes, and thou knowest me; I am \n\nthou, and thou art I." Possession by Hermes the Wise Serpent \n\nwould have been "diabolic" possession from the Christian point of view; \n\nbut the principle was the same everywhere. \n\nPeople possessed by pagan gods sometimes created a tradition \ndirectly inherited by Christianity. Worshippers of Attis castrated \n\n\n\n807 \n\n\n\nPossession themselves when fully possessed by the spirit of their castrated god. \n\nUnder the same influence "they flogged themselves until the blood \n^^^^^^^^^^^ came. In Italy such processions of flagellants during Passion Week have \ncontinued until the present day, the Madonna being the patroness of \nthese Re penitenti (penitent kings)" instead of the Great Mother of the \nGods, who formerly governed their bloodlettings. 2 \n\nTo be possessed meant to take the spirit into one\'s body, either as \nthe flesh of a sacrificial victim or as bread and wine representing that \nflesh. For the same reason that Christ "entered into" those who ate \nhim, so possession by devils was thought to occur through incautious \neating. St. Gregory the Great told of a nun who became possessed by a \ndevil after eating a bit of lettuce. The devil complained to the \nexorcist, "What wrong have I done? Here I was sitting upon this \nlettuce, and she came and ate me!"\' To speak a blessing over food \nbefore eating was originally supposed to drive out whatever devils might \nbe lurking there. \n\nPope Gregory professed an ability to recognize the signs of \ndemonic possession under any circumstances. When a horse kicked \nand plunged and refused to let him mount, he instantly realized the \nhorse was possessed by a demon. He even knew the possession had \nbeen caused by two magicians, whom he arrested, blinded, and tortured \ninto confessions. Afterward, they were "cared for" at the church\'s \nexpense for the rest of their lives, meaning they were imprisoned for \nlife. 4 \n\nAll primitive people think humans, animals, and inanimate objects \nmay serve as vessels for spirits. "The Maori term waka clearly \nindicates that the inspired man carries the god in him as a canoe carries \nits owner." 5 Our own vocabulary expresses the same belief. Inspira- \ntion means breathing in a spirit; enthusiasm means the god within. We \nsay, "What possessed you to do that?" or "I don\'t know what got into \nme." An obsessive person may be called devil-ridden or hag-ridden. \n\nEuripides called Dionysus the god of prophecy, because he took \npossession of the body through divine madness, which "makes those \nwhom he maddens foretell the future." 6 We still speak of being \n"possessed" by prophetic or poetic frenzy. Mediums are "possessed" \nby spirits of the dead, who speak through them as demons were said to \nspeak through their human hosts. \n\nMen never abandoned the notion of alien spirits within the human \nmind. Not only was the god-within concept essential to the commu- \nnion rite, but the devil-within concept was also essential to discrediting \nother deities, whose communion rites were the same. Moreover, \ndiabolic possession was affirmed by the scriptures. Summers said, "We \nhave the authority of Christ Himself as to its reality. . . . [N]o reader \nof the Scriptural narrative can deny that Christ by word and deed \nshowed His entire belief in possession by evil spirits. And if Christ \nwere divine how came He to foster and encourage a delusion?" 7 \n\nThe third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica gave the same \nofficial opinion under Demoniacs: "The reality of demoniacal posses- \n\n808 \n\n\n\nsion stands on the same evidence with the gospel system in general." A Possession \n\n19th-century Catholic authority wrote, "To deny possession by devils \n\nis to charge Jesus and his apostles with imposture How can the ^^^^^_^^__ \n\ntestimony of apostles, fathers of the Church, and saints who saw the \npossessed and so declared, be denied?" 8 \n\nSeventeenth-century clergymen fought the "evil heart of unbe- \nlief" that led people to doubt the reality of demonic possession and \nthe efficacy of exorcism. Priests vied with each other to see who could \ncast out the most demons. In a highly publicized case, Sister Made- \nleine de la Palud of the Ursuline convent of Aix-en-Provence was found \nto contain 6,666 demons including Beelzebub, Leviathan, Baalber- \nith, Asmodeus, and Astaroth the cream of hell\'s celebrities. 9 Jesuits at \nVienna claimed over 12,000 demons in a single case of possession. \nOne skeptic, Bishop Miron, suspected the possessed Martha Brossier of \nfakery when her demon sent her into convulsions at the reading of \nwhat she thought was a Latin Bible; it was actually a copy of Virgil\'s \nAeneid. Miron called the girl a fraud, but the Capuchin monks \nrejected his verdict as "Godless." 10 \n\nFraud was a major ingredient of incidents of possession, often \ndeliberately fostered by clergymen to trump up a dramatic demon- \nstration of their power over the forces of evil. At Salmesbury in 1612, \nthree women were accused of causing possession in a girl, who later \nadmitted that she had been coached by a Roman Catholic priest who \nwanted the women prosecuted, because they had defected from his \nchurch and turned Protestant. 11 Sir Walter Scott observed: \n\nThe Catholic church had much occasion to rally around her all the \nrespect that remained to her in a schismatic and heretical kingdom; and \nwhen her fathers and doctors announced the existence of such a dreadful \ndisease [as possession], and of the power of the church \'s prayers, relics, \nand ceremonies, to cure it, it was difficult for a priest, supposing him more \ntender of the interest of his order than that of the truth, to avoid such a \ntempting opportunity as a supposed case of possession offered for display- \ning the high privilege in which his profession made him a partner, or to \nabstain from conniving at the imposture, in order to obtain for his church \nthe credit of expelling the demon. It was hardly to be wondered at, if \nthe ecclesiastic was sometimes induced to aid the fraud of which such \nmotives forbade him to be the detector. ,2 \n\nSome cases were not consciously faked. Symptoms of possession \ncould be produced by such causes as hysteria, epilepsy, sexual frustra- \ntions, depression, or plain boredom. Ascetics in monasteries and \nconvents were most prone to demonic possession, which seemed a way \nto relieve the isolation, inactivity, and drabness of the cloistered life. \nNuns were often imprisoned in convents against their will, because \nhusbands wished to be rid of them, or because their parents could \ngive them no dower and so compelled them to be brides of Christ. 13 \nThe church\'s word for the depression that afflicted nuns and monks \nwas acedia, "abysmal apathy." H \n\nScreaming fits, blasphemies, sexual fantasies, and erotomania of \n\n809 \n\n\n\nPossession the possessed sprang directly from hatred of convent life, as shown by j \n\nthe nun Jeanne des Anges: \n\n^^^^^^i^^"" My mind was often filled with blasphemies, and sometimes I uttered them \n\nwithout being able to take any thought to stop myself. I felt for God a \ncontinual aversion. . . . The demon beclouded me in such a way that I \nhardly distinguished his desires from mine; he gave me moreover a \nstrong aversion for my religious calling, so that sometimes when he was in \nmy head I used to tear all my veils and such of my sisters \' as I might lay \nhands on; I trampled them underfoot, I chewed them, cursing the hour \nwhen I took the vows. . . . More often than not I saw quite well that I \nwas the prime cause of my troubles and that the demon acted only \naccording to the openings I gave him. . . . As I presented myself at \nCommunion, the devil took possession of my head, and after I had \nreceived the blessed host and half moistened it the devil threw it in the \npriest\'s face. 15 \n\nThere was a time when demonic possession was almost as \ncontagious as the common cold. It would sweep through a cloister like \nan epidemic. A 1 5th-century German convent suffered an outbreak \nof possession in which all the nuns took to biting one another. In a \nFrench convent, they began mewing like cats. At Aix in 161 1, a man \nwas burned at the stake for sending an extraordinary number of demons \ninto the nuns; one nun alone was possessed by 6500 demons. 16 \n\nPossession served as an excuse for orgiastic goings-on at several \nconvents in the 1 7th century. Father confessors at Louviers from \n1628 to 1642 instructed the nuns in lesbian intercourse, celebrated \ncommunion naked, and staged obscene masses where the officiating \npriest would attach a host to his penis, and engage in coitus or sodomy. \nNuns were forced by their "demons" to frequent coupling with both \n"devils" and prelates. At Auxonne, the Mother Superior was accused of \ncausing possession among the nuns by teaching them to masturbate \nwith a dildo. At Nimeguen, possessed nuns claimed to be sexually \nassaulted by black priapic creatures lurking in their beds. Even in the \nlate 19th century, erotic hysteria infected the sisters of Mont-Saint- \nSulpice at the instigation of a "possessed" nun Cantianille, allegedly \nviolated by a priest and dedicated to the devil at the tender age of 1 5. 17 \n\nMaria Renata Sanger, sub-prioress of a convent at Wurzburg, \nwas executed for bewitching other nuns and causing them to be \nseduced by demons in the form of handsome young men. 18 One \nwould naturally suspect that these "demons" were made of quite solid \nmaterial and entered the convent by night through some secret hole \nin the wall, with a certain amount of assistance from within. \n\nErotomania was the major ingredient of one of the most famous \ncases of fraudulent possession, that of the nuns of Loudun in the \n1630s, which ended in the legal murder of a priest, Urbain Grandier, \nwhose misfortune it was to have made some powerful enemies. \n\nWith the Mother Superior setting the example, claiming posses- \nsion by four major demons Leviathan, Balan, Iscaron, and \n\n\n\n810 \n\n\n\nBehemoth the nuns accused Father Grandier of causing their fren- Possession \n\nzies, which only grew worse with every attempt at exorcism. 19 The \n\npriest maintained his innocence though hideously tortured; his legs were ^_^^^^^^^^^ \ncrushed to pulp in the boots. He refused to name any accomplices, as \nthe custom demanded. To build their case, his torturers said he was \nreally invoking the devil when he prayed aloud to God for deliver- \nance from his sufferings. 20 At last a phony pact with the devil was forged \nand "found" to seal his doom. It said: \n\nMy Lord and Master, I own you for my God; I promise to serve you while \nI live, and from this hour I renounce all other gods and Jesus Christ and \nMary and all the Saints of Heaven and the Catholic, Apostolic, and \nRoman Church, and all the goodwill thereof and the prayers which \nmight be made for me. I promise to adore you and do you homage at least \nthree times a day and to do the most evil that I can and to lead into evil \nas many persons as shall be possible to me, and heartily I renounce the \nChrism, Baptism, and all the merits of Jesus Christ; and, in case I \nshould desire to change, I give you my body and soul, and my life as \nholding it from you, having dedicated it forever without any will to \nrepent. Signed URBAIN GRANDIER in his blood. 2 \' \n\nAfter Urbain Grandier was burned at the stake, possession of the \nnuns continued. It had become a tourist attraction, and the sisters were \ncelebrities. They learned to show off for the crowds, like Sister Claire: \n\nShe fell on the ground, blaspheming, in convulsions, lifting up her \npetticoats and chemise, displaying her privy parts without any shame, \nand uttering filthy words. Her gestures became so indecent that the \naudience averted its eyes. She cried out again and again, abusing herself \nwith her hands, "Come on then, foutez-moi! [fuck me]!" 22 \n\nPossession was often achieved by children and adolescents, who \nknew with a sure instinct what would gain them the most attention. The \nconveniently timed hysteria of adolescent girls, followed up by adults\' \nsuperstitious fears, created the notorious witch-craze at Salem, Massa- \nchusetts; the basic idea had long been common in England. Panicked \nby any sign of fits in a child, parents and neighbors immediately began a \nsearch for the witch who was to blame." Needless to say, any child \nwho learned what a stir he could cause in this way was strongly \nmotivated to repeat it. \n\nIn 1 595 a thirteen-year-old Staffordshire boy learned to throw fits \nat the sight of a woman named Alice Gooderidge, who was tortured \nby having her feet burned to induce her to confess sending a demon \ninto the child. Upon being faced with him, Alice pleaded, "Thomas, \nI pray you forgive me and be good to me." But Thomas only fell into "a \nmarvelous sore fit," went into a trance, "saw a man come out of the \nchamber pot, flames of fire, and the heavens open." To Alice he said, \n"Yonder comes Mother Red Cap, look how they beat her brains out, \nsee what it is to be a witch; see how the toads gnaw the flesh from her \nbones." Alice Gooderidge was convicted of witchcraft and died in \nprison. 2 \n\n\n\n811 \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\n\nPossession Faked possession was used to condemn 80-year-old Ann Boden- \n\nham in 1653. A servant girl caught with stolen silverware accused \n\n^ m ^^^^ Ann Bodenham of sending a demon into her in the form of a black man \nwithout a head. The girl went into fits in Mrs. Bodenham\'s presence \nbut was instantly relieved when the "witch" was removed from the \nroom. She described how Mrs. Bodenham had transformed herself \ninto a black cat to tempt her into the devil\'s service. 25 Convicted and on \nher way to the gallows, the old woman called for beer, and cursed all \nwho refused her. As was the custom, the hangman asked her forgiveness \nbefore turning her off the ladder. She snapped, "Forgive thee? A pox \non thee, turn me off," and died in her rage. 26 \n\nAt Norfolk in 1 600, a woman named Margaret Francis allegedly \nbewitched a girl who exhibited the usual symptoms of possession: \n\nTearing her hair, and beating herself, and her head against bedsteads and \nstools, sometimes foaming, sometimes dolefully shrieking and blaring \nlike a calf; groaning, howling, and barking like a dog; and biting like a mad \ndog. Her head, feet, and legs were drawn awry and almost backward; \nand she stared, & gaped most fearfully and gnashed her teeth and lay as 1 \ndead and senseless many times a day and more sometimes together, \nwithout breath or panting, saving that her natural color remained still \nfresh; and yet, sometimes suddenly she did spit in the faces of them that \nstood by or at her friends or at the name of Jesus; and sometimes she did , \nsmite at her parents also . . . sometimes storming at God and good \nmen, and sometimes blaspheming God, saying God is a good man I can I \ndo as much as he; I care not for Jesus, etc. Some things were uttered, \nunknown before to the maid; and many times in a strange snappish voice; \nand sometimes in the tune and voice of the witch and in her phrases \nand terms. 27 \n\nExorcism rarely relieved such symptoms, but more often exac- \nerbated them, since the exorcistic ritual only increased the effect desired \nby making the afflicted one all the more a center of attention. More \npractical cures brought about the miracle that exorcism failed to pro- \nduce. In 1835 an epidemic of possession was well under way at a \nFrench convent in Morzine. Professor Tissot investigated, and found \nthe nuns went into fits at the touch of holy water if they knew what it \nwas, but secretly they could be dosed with quarts of it in wine or food, \nwithout effect. The demons were cast out by the police, who \nappeared with orders to treat the possessed as lunatics and remove them \nto an asylum. Immediately, all symptoms vanished. 28 \n\nThe Dutch physician Boerhaave found an epidemic of possession \nin a Haarlem hospital ward, with patients going into convulsions and \nimitating each other in acts of frenzy. He ordered a brazier of coals and \na cauterizing iron placed in the ward, and promised to brand the next \nvictim of possession. There were no more cases. A similar report from \nJapan told of the miraculous cure of a possessed girl, whose father \ntied her to a pillar and rushed at her with a drawn sword, crying, \n\n\n\n812 \n\n\n\npicked spirit, if you do not forthwith leave this child I will kill you Possession \n\nloth!" The child was instantly cured. 29 \n\nSome authorities recommended flagellation as a cure for posses- ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nj.on. Bergomensi said a "prudent and moderate" whipping could \n|/ork wonders. 30 Of course it never worked in cases of illness caused by \njemonic possession. Demons were convenient scapegoats for igno- \njant doctors, and many diseases were attributed to possession. Some \nuthorities even insisted that every illness is caused by demons. 31 \nimong the long lists of "signs" of demonic possession were the \nflowing: inability to retain food; sensation of weight in the stomach; \nain in the lower belly, kidneys, or head; lassitude; impotence; weaken- \niig or emaciation of the body; fiery pains in the entrails; sudden \nfelling of the stomach; yellowish or pale complexion; melancholia. \n!)emonic possession was the proper diagnosis "if skilled physicians \nre not sure what the affliction is, and cannot form an opinion about it; \nr if the medications prescribed do not help but rather increase the \nickness." 32 Since the medications of the period usually did make the \nick sicker, possession must have been a frequent diagnosis. \n\nAside from its usefulness to physicians, the theory of possession \n/as useful to the possessed themselves. It provided an outlet for \n(idden rage. This psychological function is still seen in groups who \nprmally court possession. In the zar, or demon, cult of modern \nEthiopia, Moslem wives maintain a religion of demonism conducted by \npatrilineal priestesses. It\'s the only religion the women have, where \nven Coptic churches refuse to admit them, and the only feminist \nistitution in the country. An observer reported that the zar cult is \nnormously popular, and most women participate despite opposition \nrom their husbands, "who fear the sexual and economic emancipa- \nion of the wife." 33 \n\nPossession is induced by drumming, chanting, and rhythmic \njfiovement. A woman is "ridden" by her demon or zar, a name \nerhaps traceable all the way back to Osiris Zer. 34 The possessed \n/oman shrieks, babbles, blasphemes, vents her sexual frustrations and \neaps bitter abuse on her husband. She demands new clothes, gifts and \nrnaments, which must be given her, as part of the cure. "The \npidemiology of possession starts a chain of events that enables them \nthe women] to escape from their social confinement" for a while, \nt least. 35 \n\nThe same forces used to operate in Christian society. Oppressed \n/omen used their "demons" to tell the Heavenly Father what they \nlought of him, without incurring the punishment of heretics. Demonic \nossession was the confessional of the dispossessed. \n\nOr again, the same theory of possession was used to excuse sadistic \nehavior. As late as 1895 one Michael Geary of Clonmel, Ireland, \nortured and burned his young wife Bridget on the pretext that she was \nassessed by a devil. 36 With the help of several other men, he poured \n\n\n\n813 \n\n\n\nparaffin over her and set her afire. The men dragged her to the hearth \nand made her sit on the fire, while her husband recited exorcisms. 37 \n\nIn 1966, a Swiss girl named Bernadette Hasler was beaten to death \nby two religious fanatics who claimed they were driving out her \ndemon. Churchmen\'s reaction to this case was interesting. Johannes \nVonderach, bishop of Chur, seemed more concerned about the \nmurderers\' usurpation of clerical prerogatives than about the fact that \nmurder had been done. He announced, "Just as the Church sepa- \nrates itself from superstitious belief in miracles, it rejects a false belief in \nthe Devil. However, as it regards the Devil seriously, on the basis of \nHoly Writ, it places itself doubly under the protection of the crucified \nLord." 38 \n\nThis is a notable example of theological doubletalk, making one \nwonder what can be the difference between "superstitious" belief in \nmiracles and nonsuperstitious belief in miracles; or between "false" \nbelief in the Devil and real belief in the Devil. What for that matter can \nbe the difference between a fanatic who believes in the Devil because \nhe reads the Bible, and a church that "regards the Devil seriously, on \nthe basis of Holy Writ"? In his haste to separate his church from the \ntwo criminals, Vonderach betrayed his own ignorance of Holy Writ. \nJohn said to Jesus, "Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy \nname; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us." Jesus \nanswered, "Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us" \n(Luke 9:49-50). \n\nIn August 1976 the following item appeared in the American \npress: \n\nThe voice on the tapes was that of a woman, but it was unnaturally deep \nand the words were incoherent screams mixed with furious profanities. \nThe tapes recorded the dying days of a timid, 23-year-old epileptic named \nAnnaliese Michel, and they were part of the evidence in a manslaugh- \nter case West German authorities were preparing last week against the \nRoman Catholic Bishop ofWurzburg, Josef Stangl, and two priests he \nappointed to exorcise the Devil from the young woman. When Michel \ndied last month of malnutrition and dehydration, she weighed only 70 \npounds. One of the priests, Father Arnold Renz, maintained that six \ndevils including Nero, Judas, Hitler and Lucifer himself possessed \nMichel and made her refuse to eat. }9 \n\nThat such human tragedies can still occur in a purportedly \nenlightened age is grim proof of the blindness that can be engendered \nby "blind faith." Perhaps the definitive remark on the subject of \npossession was made in 1970 by Dr. Henry Ansgard Kelley of the \nUniversity of California: "Diabolical possession is caused by belief in \ndiabolical possession."\' 10 \n\n1.

She made man in the \nli image of a god, and infused him with the breath of heaven, which \n1 brought him to life. 1 Aruru was also Ishtar, Inanna, Ninhursag, and \nMami, Mama, or Mammitu; she made the first man (Adam) out of \nclay (adamah, the female earth). Assyrians said she made seven clay \nj mother-wombs for females and seven clay mother-wombs for males: \n"The creatress of destiny, in pairs she completed them; the forms of the \npeople Mami forms." 2 \n\nThe biblical story of God\'s creation of Adam out of clay was \nplagiarized from ancient texts with the patriarchs\' usual sex-change of \nthe deity. Mesopotamian flesh-is-clay images were derived from the \nprimitive matriarchate, when all pottery belonged to women. "The \nart of pottery is a feminine invention; the original potter was a woman. \nAmong all primitive peoples the ceramic art is found in the hands of \nwomen, and only under the influence of advanced culture does it \nbecome a man\'s occupation." ? \n\nThe Goddess was worshipped as a Potter in the Jewish temple, \nwhere she received "thirty pieces of silver" as the price of a sacrificial \nvictim (Zechariah 11:13). She owned the Field of Blood, Aceldama, \nwhere clay was moistened with the blood of victims so bought. Judas, \nwho allegedly sold Jesus for this same price, was himself another victim \nof the Potter. In the Potter\'s Field he was either hanged (Matthew \n27:5) or disemboweled (Acts 1:18), suggesting that the Potter was none \nother than the Goddess who both created and destroyed. \n\nIndia\'s Kali Ma was the same creating-and-destroying Goddess, \nwith a special incarnation as Kel Mari the Pot Goddess. 4 Since she \nmade the first man out of clay, her people were Aryans, from arya, \n"man of clay." 5 Kel Mari was related to Mari of Mesopotamia, or \nMariamne, or Miriam, or Mary, whose name was connected with the \ndeaths of both John the Baptist and Jesus. Her earth, which drank the \nblood of sacrificed men, might have been the same Aceldama that drank \nthe blood of Judas. \n\nKali\'s other name Maya was the same as the central American \ncivilization whose women produced remarkable pottery. The oldest \nform of Maya pottery was known as Mamom, "the Grandmother." \nVon Hagen says, "Pottery was woman. All we see of the remains of \nthe Maya ceramic art was done by women. It is a fact that should be \nstressed. In almost every place where pottery making was on an \n\n\n\n815 \n\n\n\nPrakriti archaic level Africa or Melanesia pottery was woman-made and its \n\nPriapus design was woman-inspired. Throughout the area of the Amazon, \n\n^^^^^^^_^^ pottery was a woman\'s task. Women were the potters, so far as we \nknow, in ancient Peru. Early Greek and early Egyptian pottery was \nalso woman-made until the introduction of the potter\'s wheel. ... All \nthe superbly beautiful patterns found on pottery (as well as weaving) \nwere conceived by women." 6 \n\nThe biblical God couldn\'t give birth, so he copied the next best \ncreation technique and molded his first man out of clay, as the \nGoddess did before him. \n\nI.EpicofGilgamesh, 121. 2.

Priapus was a primitive form of Eros, \nbased on the wooden ithyphallic idols worshipped in early Greece, later \ntranslated into stone herms or temple phalli for deflowering brides. 1 \nSee Firstborn. Some of Priapus\'s grotesque images lasted through the \nMiddle Ages, and were even worshipped as saints (see Phallus \nWorship). \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,71. \n\n\n\n816 \n\n\n\nPrisca, Saint Prisca, Saint \n\nMythical "virgin martyr" invented from an icon of the Mother \n\nGoddess with her palm branch in her hand and a lion at her feet. The i^^^^^mmim^^^ \n\nChristian tale claimed that during the reign of Claudius, Prisca was \n\ncondemned to be thrown to the lions for the crime of wanting to \n\npreserve her virginity. Her innocence exuded such powerful magic \n\nthat the beasts refused to eat her, and lay down at her feet like house \n\ncats. Later she was beheaded. 1 Apparently human beings were better \n\nable than lions to resist her charm. \n\nUnfortunately for the legend\'s credibility, Christians weren\'t slain \nin the reign of Claudius. On the contrary, Claudius earnestly wished \nto preserve freedom of religion in his empire, and begged warring \nChristian sects to "stop this destructive and obstinate mutual en- \nmity." 2 Claudius was, however, a devotee of Mother Cybele, who was \npictured on his coins with a lion at her feet, like the original icon of \nSaint Prisca. 3 \n\nThe only human Prisca who might be legitimately connected with \nearly Christianity was a woman believed to have been the real author \nof the Epistle to the Hebrews, sometimes called Priscilla, "Little \nPrisca." 4 There is no evidence that she was ever martyred. \n\n1.

Morris, 121. \n\n\n\nPrometheus \n\nGreek "Forethought," probably not the god\'s original name but the \nnearest vocal equivalent to Sanskrit pramantha, the swastika or fire-drill \nsacred to Agni, the fire god who brought fertility to Kali\'s water \nelement. Prometheus brought fire or "light" to mankind as Lucifer did, \nagainst the will of the Olympian heavenly father. Yet Zeus himself \nappeared as Zeus Prometheus at Thurii, holding a fire-drill. 1 \n\nOne of the Hindu notions of creation was that all things arose from \nthe action of male firesticks (Agni) twirling in the female groove \n(Ambika-Kali). 2 The Sea Dyaks have the same image of sexual creation. \nThey say only one woman survived the Deluge. She made a fire-drill \nand used it as a phallus. By its motion in her body, she conceived the \nhuman race. 3 Such myths obviously date back to the time before \nsemen was credited with the power of conception. One of the early \ntheories of fatherhood was that only sexual "motion" stimulated \nformation of life in the womb. \n\nThe Greeks didn\'t know where Prometheus came from. Diodorus \nsaid he was Egyptian. An Orphic hymn identified him with Saturn. \nLycophron called him "the Ethiopian god Prometheus." 4 He was the \nconsort of Libyan Athene, who gave life to the human beings he \nmolded out of clay (see Potter). From Athene he learned the secrets of \n\n\n\n817 \n\n\n\nPrometheus the civilized arts, and passed them on to his proteges, along with the \n\nstolen "fire from heaven" identified with lightning, or enlightenment, or \n^^^^^^^^^_ godly knowledge that Zeus wished to keep secret from humans. 5 \n\nLike Lucifer, Prometheus disobeyed the heaven-father by being \nmore benevolent toward humanity than he was. Aeschylus\'s Prome- \ntheus Bound plainly showed more sympathy toward the disobedient one \nthan toward the God he offended. Zeus punished Prometheus by \nhaving him chained to a Caucasian mountaintop where his liver was \ndaily devoured by his own totemic eagle and nightly restored to be \ndevoured again. The sea nymphs wailed for Prometheus. The Daugh- \nters of Ocean cursed Zeus as an insolent despot. The other \nlightning-god Hephaestus muttered seditiously, "The mind of Zeus \nknows no turning, and ever harsh the hand that newly grasps the \nsway." \n\nPrometheus himself mused, "I rescued mankind from the heavy \nblow that was to cast them into Hades. . . . Mankind I helped, but I \ncould not help myself." He prophesied Zeus\'s downfall at the hands of \nancient female powers of justice (or karma): "The Fates triform and \nthe unforgetting Furies." He told Io the Moon-cow, also oppressed by \nZeus, that her offspring would be the instrument of Zeus\'s doom. \n\nThe Prometheus myth presaged the Gnostics\' sympathy for Luci- \nfer, who was the same sort of hero a philanthropic anti-god unfairly \npunished for giving "light" or "enlightenment" to humanity. Gnostic \nicons copied early pictures of Prometheus molding the first man out \nof clay while Athene stood waiting to infuse the figure with the spirit of \nlife. Behind her rose a tree encircled by a serpent, totemic symbol of \nher wisdom. 6 The story of Eden was based on just such icons. \n\nAccording to another myth, Prometheus tricked Zeus into accept- \ning the less edible parts of sacrificial animals, such as the fat and \nbones, on behalf of the gods, while human beings were allowed to \nconsume the meat. This was not what Zeus intended, and he swore \nrevenge on both Prometheus and his human friends. 7 Still, he had made \nhis choice and had to stick to it. The biblical Yahweh made the same \nchoice, and so received only the fat and guts of sacrificial animals \n(Leviticus 4) while the priests ate the rest. The Greek sense of humor \nenvisioned Zeus accepting such offal only because he was forced to, \nhaving sworn by the Styx to keep to his choice; but the Jews simply \nclaimed that Yahweh preferred it. \n\nPrometheus was made one of the Titans, the group of gigantic \nearth-spirits who predated Zeus and his Olympian host, and were \ngenerally hostile to them. The battle between Zeus\'s Olympians and the \nTitans, in which the latter were deprived of the status of gods and \nchained under the earth, was one of the prototypes of the Judeo- \nChristian "war in heaven." \n\n1.

Conversely, anyone\'s \niritual authority was dependent on fulfillment of prophecies that \n\nalready been made. This was so important in establishing Christian- \n\\f that the New Testament again and again relates events that were \njne only to fulfill some prophetic text from the Old Testament. By \ntemporary notions, the coming of Jesus or any other spiritual \ner was of no account unless it had been prophesied by a different \nitual leader. \n\nProphets were sometimes carried away by the ecstatic spirit and \nphesied too literally, so the prophecy could be too easily checked, \nus the prophetic God seemed to tell lies. Provision was made for this \nculty in the Bible not to excuse the over-zealous prophet, but to \n:cuse God: "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the \nling follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord \nath not spoken" (Deuteronomy 18:22). Of course this made it \nnpossible to tell, at the time, whether any given prophecy was \nenuine or not; and this rather defeated the whole purpose of prophecy. \n\n\n\nProphecy \nProstitution \n\n\n\n\'rorsa and Postverta \n\nTwo faces of the Etruscan year-goddess Anna Perenna, who looked \norward and backward in Time, therefore ruled both prophecy of the \niiture and history of the past. The Romans masculinized her as \nanus. \n\n\n\nProserpina \n\nRoman version of Persephone, queen of the underworld. Along with \nHecate and Diana, Proserpina was frequently designated "queen of \nwitches" in medieval tradition. Christian Gnostics spoke of her as the \ndeath-goddess whom every soul would meet soon after death. Christian \ndemonologists listed Proserpina among the dignitaries of hell, as the \n"arch she-devil." 1 She had a poetic appeal however for such as Swin- \nburne, who said she "gathers all things mortal with cold immortal \nhands"; and in her mystic garden there was "only the sleep eternal in an \neternal night." 2 \n\n1. de Givry, 141. 2. Swinburne, TTie Garden of Proserpine. \n\n\n\nvar. Proserpine \n\n\n\nProstitution \n\nLike the devadasis of Hindu temples, prostitute-priestesses dispensed \nthe grace of the Goddess in ancient Middle-Eastern temples. They \n\n\n\n819 \n\n\n\nProstitution \n\n\n\nAs Mother of \nHarlots, Ishtar was \ncalled the Great \nGoddess HAR. Her \nhigh priestess the \nHarine was spiritual \nruler of "the city of \nIshtar." 4 HAR was a \ncognate of the \nPersian houri and the \nGreek Hora, also the \norigin of "harem," \nwhich used to mean \na Temple of Women, \nor a sanctuary. 5 A \nsimilar meaning was \nonce attached to \nseraglio, from Semitic \nserai, a shrine of \nqueens. \n\n\n\nwere often known as Charites or Graces, since they dealt in the \nunique combination of beauty and kindness called chads (Latin caritas) \nthat was later translated "charity." Actually it was like Hindu karuna, \na combination of mother-love, tenderness, comfort, mystical enlighten- \nment, and sex. \n\nHesiod said the sensual magic of the sacred whores or Horae \n"mellowed the behavior of men." 1 Ishtar, the Great Whore of \nBabylon, announced, "A prostitute compassionate am I." 2 Mary Mag- \ndalene said of her sisters in the profession, "Not only are we \ncompassionate of ourselves, but we are compassionate of all the race of \nmankind." 3 \n\nAncient harlots often commanded high social status and were \nrevered for their learning. 6 As embodiments of the Queen of Heav- \nen, in Palestine called Qadeshet, the Great Whore, the harlots were \nhonored like queens at centers of learning in Greece and Asia \nMinor. 7 Some even became queens. The empress Theodora, wife of \nJustinian, began her career as a temple harlot. 8 St. Helena, mother of \nConstantine, was a harlot before she became an empress-saint. 9 \n\nIn an Egyptian story, a priestess of Bubastis demanded all of a \nman\'s worldly goods for one night of her love. She said, "I am a \nhierodule; I am no mean person." 10 Until recently Egypt still had a class \nof women called ghazye, "sacred whores," who were greatly honored \nin the time of the Mamelukes and prized as brides when their period of \nservice was ended. 11 \n\nTemple prostitutes were revered as healers of the sick. Their very \nsecretions were supposed to have medical virtue. A Sufi proverb still \nsuggests this opinion: "There is healing in a woman\'s vagina." 12 Even } \ntheir spittle could perform cures. Jesus\'s cure of blindness by spittle \n(Mark 8:23) was copied from a matriarchal tradition. A clay tablet from \nNineveh says eye diseases can be cured by a harlot\'s spittle. 15 Harlots \nwere also sorceresses, prophets, and seers. The Hebrew word zonah \nmeans both a prostitute and a prophetess. 14 \n\nHoly Mothers designated the promiscuous priestess-shamanesses \nof Japan, also known as spirit-women. Becoming Brides of God, they \nentered the shrine to lie with a priest possessed by the god\'s spirit. 15 \nSimilar customs distinguished the Indian devadasis, human copies of \nthe lascivious Heavenly Nymphs. \n\nThe profession was popular. Temples of Aphrodite at Eryx, \nCorinth, Cyprus, and other sites were served by a thousand sacred \nharlots apiece. 16 When Hellenic Greeks reduced wives to the status of \nservants, the hetaerae or courtesans remained legally and politically \nequal to men. Roman matrons of the highest aristocracy prostituted \nthemselves in the temple of Juno Sospita when a revelation was \nneeded. 17 Every Babylonian woman prostituted herself in the temple \nbefore marriage. 18 By Amorite sacred law, "she who was about to \nmarry should sit in fornication seven days by the gate (of the temple)." 19 \nSuch laws were supposed to appease the Goddess, who disapproved \n\n\n\n820 \n\n\n\nof monogamy in the era when there was no formal marriage and Prostitution \n\nchildren didn\'t know their fathers. 20 In Greek myth, the Great \n\nMother forbade the Heavenly Father Zeus to make a monogamous ^^^^^^^^^^^ m \n\nmarriage, holding that only her own ancient system of group mar- \nriage was honorable. 21 \n\nThe Tantric word for a sacred harlot was Veshya, probable origin \nof the Goddess\'s oldest names in Greece and Rome, Hestia or Vesta, \nthe Hearth-mother, served by the Vestal Virgins who were originally \nharlot-priestesses. 22 "Hearth" and "Earth" both arose from the altar \nof the Saxon Goddess Ertha, or Heartha, the northern Hestia- Vesta. In \nthe matriarchal age, every woman\'s hearth-fire was her altar. 23 The \nhearth was also the omphalos, feminine hub of the universe, navel-stone \nof the temple, around which the sacred harlots performed their \nDances of Time. \n\nDancing harlots came to be called Hours: Persian houri, Greek \nhorae. Egyptian temple-women also were Ladies of the Hour. Each \nruled a certain hour of the night, and protected the solar boat of Ra in \nthe underworld during his passage through her hour. 24 The Dance of \nthe Hours began as a pagan ceremony of the Horae (divine "Whores") \nwho kept the hours of the night by dances, as Christian monks later \nkept the hours of the day by prayers. The oldest authentic Hebrew folk \ndance is still called hora after the circle dances of the sacred harlots. \nThe Horae also guarded the gates of heaven, ministered to the souls of \nthe blessed, and turned the heavenly spheres. 25 (See Houri.) \n\nThe Hebrew word hor means a hole, cave, or pit, common \nsynonyms for both a sacred prostitute and the Goddess she served, \nwhose yoni was represented by a hole, cave, pit, or pool of water in the \nheart of the temple. 26 A similar Latin term was puteus, a well or pit, \nsource of the Spanish puta, "whore." Common folk the Romans buried \nin puticuli, "pits," which like all graves used to stand for the womb of \nrebirth. 27 The common root was Vedic puta, "pure" or "holy," and the \nAvestan putika, a mystical lake of the waters of birth. 28 "Lady of the \nLake" was a title of the Great Goddess throughout Eurasia. In Aramaic, \nher shrines were Athra qaddisa, "the holy place," literally a "heavenly \nharlot-place," or genital pit or lake. 29 \n\n"To dive into water means to delve into the mystery of Maya, to \nquest after the ultimate secret of life. . . . [T]he cosmic waters are at \nonce the immaculate source of all things and dreadful grave." 30 All \nAsia called water a female element, the source of creation, the archeoi \nStoic philosophy. To dive into such water was a symbol of sexual \nintercourse. Communing in this way with a holy whore, man could \nrealize the spiritual enlightenment called horasis. This word appears \nin the New Testament (Acts 2:17), misleadingly translated "visions." 31 \n\nA Semitic clan, the Horites of Genesis 36, traced their descent \nfrom the Great Goddess as "Hora." 32 The Jews had cult prostitutes \nin the time of King Josiah, when they lived next to the temple and wove \nhangings for the sacred grove (2 Kings 23:7). Modern translations of \n\n\n\n821 \n\n\n\nProstitution \n\n\n\nNauplia Ancient \ncity near Argos in the \nPeloponnese, site of \nHera\'s sacred spring \nCanathos. \n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and geographer \nof the 2nd century \na.d. Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the an- \ncient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nthe Bible call them "sodomites," but the original wording meant holy \nharlots." Such holy harlots were often "brides of God," set apart to \ngive birth to Sons of God, i.e., prophets and sometimes sacrificial \nvictims.\' 4 \n\nHoly whores were called "virgins" because they remained unmar- \nried (see Virgin Birth). Like medieval nuns, they took veils as a \nbadge of their office. Ishtar-Asherah-Mari-Anath was not only the Great \nWhore but also the Great Virgin (kadesha, holy one). Her Greek \nname was Athene, also described as a "virgin" (Parthenia); but Athene\'s \ntemple, the Parthenon, was served by promiscuous hierodules like all \nother shrines of the Goddess. Later myths rationalized the perpetual \n"virginity" of lascivious fertility-goddesses by periodic hymen-renewing \nceremonies such as sea baptism, annual bathing in sacred springs, etc. \nThe virginity of Great Mother Hera was annually restored by a dip in \nthe spring of Canathos at Nauplia. Pausanias said the myth was based \non a rite of bathing the Goddess\'s image. 35 \n\nBecause whores occupied a significant position in paganism, Chris- \ntians vilified their profession. Churchmen didn\'t want to stamp out \nprostitution altogether, only amputate its spiritual meanings. St. John \nChrysostom earned high praise from the Patriarch of Constantinople \nfor robbing temple prostitutes of "the honors paid to them." 36 The triad \nof heavenly Horae were mythically virginized as three maiden saints \nmartyred together, Agape, Chionia, and Irene (Love-feast, She of \nChios, and Peace). 37 Real horae were relegated to hora-houses, no \nlonger temples. The traditional red light of the whorehouse descended \nfrom the houses of Roman venerii who displayed the sign of an erect \nphallus, painted blood red. 38 \n\nMedieval Germanic law forbade a man to build a horgr, or to call \nhis house a horgr, on pain of forfeiting every penny he owned; \nbecause horgr meant a pagan shrine, a house of "holy whores" where \npriestesses carried on the old religion. Such place names as Horgsholt \nin Iceland still identify ancient shrines. 39 \n\nIn the year 1000 a.d. the Icelanders agreed to become Christian in \nname at least, and to be baptized; but all who wished were still legally \npermitted to celebrate the rites of their ancestors in private houses called \nhorgr, for a while, until the church rescinded its promises of toler- \nance. 40 In earlier centuries, the horgr seems to have been a mons \nveneris or omphalos in a sacred grove. 41 \n\nSometimes the alternate word hus (house) carried the same sense \nof "a place of worship," because every matriarch once worshipped \nthe Goddess of her own hearth, which she could share with more than \none hus-band. Hence the word hussy, Lady of the House, by \nChristian definition a promiscuous woman. 42 \n\nPromiscuity was appreciated, rather than deplored, by medieval \nminnesingers who worshipped the Goddess under her new name of \nMinne, "Love." They objected to commercialized prostitution as a \ndegradation of their deity: "Love, the queen of all hearts, the free- \n\n\n\n822 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nborn, the one and only, is put up for public sale! What a shameful Prostitution \n\ntribute is this that our mastery has required of her! We cultivate Love \n\nwith embittered minds, with lies, and with deceit, and then expect from ^mammm^^^mmi^^ \nher joy of body and heart; but instead, she bears only pain, corrup- \ntion, evil fruit, and blight as her soil was sown." 4 * \n\nTheologians however accepted commercial prostitution as "a law- \nful immorality," in St. Thomas Aquinas\'s self-contradictory phrase. \nAquinas said prostitution was necessary to prevent men from sodomiz- \ning each other: "Take away prostitutes from the world," he said, "and \nyou will fill it with sodomy." 44 Prostitution enabled man to look upon \npromiscuous women as depraved, though their equally promiscuous \nclients were seen as helpless victims of compulsion. There was no \nrecognition of the truth, that most prostitutes acted under a more \ntelling compulsion than any man\'s sexuality: the need to earn where- \nwithal to keep alive. It was not an easy living. At best the prostitute \nwas forced to make herself a stranger\'s abject servant. At worst, she \ncould become his tormented victim. 45 \n\nCertain anticlerical writers maintained that prostitutes should be \nrespected for their willingness to be kind. Lorenzo Valla\'s 1 5th- \ncentury De Voluptate called for a return to ancient customs, echoing \nHorace\'s Omnia voluptas bona est Valla wrote: "Whores and \nprostitutes deserve more from the human race than do nuns with their \nchastity and virginity!" 46 Of course, such sentiments did not prevail. \nTwo centuries later, English apprentices celebrated each Shrove Tues- \nday by breaking into whorehouses and beating the inmates. It also \nbecame customary in England for men to "punish" the whores they \npatronized by hamstringing: cutting the sinews of the legs to make \nthe woman a permanent cripple. 47 One might be reminded of the \nChinese custom of crippling courtesans by footbinding. \n\nGod punished the whores in hell even more severely than men \npunished them on earth, according to God\'s spokesmen, whose \nasceticism engendered sexual fantasies of astonishing violence. 48 Monk- \nish deprivations and repressions led to secret envy and fierce hatred of \nthe carnal folk who might be suspected of enjoying sexual activity. 49 \nThe hatred poured out in a thousand nasty fantasies of hell. Abbe \nFrancois Arnoux, canon of Riez in 1622, provides an example: \n\n\n\nAnd the light women, these shall have in their arms a dragon most cruel, \nflaming with Are . . . who shall bind and enchain their feet and their \nlegs with his serpent tail and shall clasp their whole body with his cruel \ntalons, who shall put his beslabbered and reeking mouth upon theirs, \nbreathing therein flames of Are and sulphur and poison and venom, who \nwith his nose, glandered and hideous, shall breathe into theirs a breath \nmost stinking and venomous . . . this dragon shall make them suffer a \nthousand agonies, a thousand colics and bitter twistings of the belly, and \nall the damned shall howl, and the devils with them, "See the wanton! see \nthe strumpet! Let her be tortured indeed! To it, to it, ye devils! To it, \nye demons! To it, ye hellish furies! See the harlot! See the trull! Hurl ye \nupon this whore and wreak upon her all the torments ye can! " so \n\n\n\n823 \n\n\n\nProstitution \n\n\n\nKastoria The ancient \nCeletrum, a town \nand nome in Greek \nMacedonia. \n\n\n\nOn the wall of the women\'s section of the Church of St. John \nthe Baptist in Kastoria, a painting showed God\'s punishment of a \nwhore. Bound in hell, the woman had her legs stretched apart by two \ndemons, while a third demon plunged red-hot irons into her vagina. \nNext to the woman punished for being sexually available, another \nwoman labeled the Vain Coquette was similarly punished for nor being \nsexually available. 51 Women attending this church might well be \nexcused for thinking they were damned if they did and damned if they \ndidn\'t. \n\nChurchmen did not distinguish between a professional prosti- \ntute and a woman in love with a lover. Both were "whores." The whole \npoint of patriarchal morality was that women must not have the right \nto pick and choose men. For a woman to fall passionately in love was a \ntragedy under the medieval church: to pay for a few stolen hours of \nlove, both she and her lover were doomed to an eternity of suffering. 52 \nThe point was illustrated by Grunewald\'s painting The Damnation \nof Lovers, showing a sinful pair as emaciated corpses living in hell, with \nworms burrowing through their flesh, the woman crowned with a \ncoiled serpent, her genitals gnawed by a toad. According to a 1 5th- \ncentury illustration for St. Augustine\'s De Civitate Dei, lovers would \nbe bound together on spits in hell and roasted over coals fanned by \ndevils. 53 \n\nWith western religion envisioning such grisly punishments for \nsexual enjoyment, it is hardly surprising to find western civilization as \na whole seized by a sick compulsion to destroy all forms of pleasure. 54 \nEven in the Christian heaven however, whores had their special \nprotectors, modeled on pagan Roman harlot-goddesses like Venus \nand Meretrix. Official Catholic patrons of whores were St. Aphra, St. \nAphrodite, and St. Maudline (Magdalen), simple canonizations of \nformer titles of the Goddess. 55 Chief protectress of whores was the \nvirgin Mary. In Antwerp up to the present century, prostitutes spent \ncertain annual feast days marching in procession to the churches, to \ndedicate candles to the Holy Virgin whom they called their own \nspecial deity. 56 \n\nAn oft-told tale of the Middle Ages said when a nun decided to \nrun away from her convent, to live as a prostitute for a few days, \nMary assumed the errant nun\'s appearance and took her place in the \nconvent, so she wouldn\'t be missed and pursued. 57 A German variant \nof the story said the nun, Beatrix, left the convent to live with her \nheathen lover for 1 5 years. When she returned, she found that Mary \nhad served as her stand-in all the while. 58 \n\nMedieval brothels were not always clearly distinguished from \nconvents. A trace of the pagan collegia of priestesses still clung to \nboth institutions. Early "double convents," with men and women \nunited in one community, sometimes housed consecrated prostitutes. \nSeveral popes maintained "holy brothels" in Rome; Queen Joanna of \n\n\n\n824 \n\n\n\nle her c \n\n\n\nb \n\n\n\nNaples founded a religious house of prostitutes called The Abbey in Prostitution \n\nthe papal city of Avignon. In Victorian times, it was still a common \n\ncustom to call the madam of a whorehouse "the abbess," though the ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhistorical precedent was forgotten. 59 See Mary Magdalene. \n\nOutside the Judeo-Christian tradition, prostitution often became a \nfully legitimate lifestyle. Black Africans never fully accepted mission- \naries\' views on the matter. White men\'s laws deprived African women \nof their property and their monopoly of farming, trading, and crafts \ny which they supported their children. African women suffered a \n\nstating loss of self-respect, for in their society a woman without \ner own income was regarded with contempt. On finding that white \nmen would pay for their sexual favors, many African women took up \nprostitution as their last remaining chance to make an honest living. \nAfricans still regard a successful prostitute as a usefully employed \nbusinesswoman rather than a criminal. 60 \n\nBy contrast, Christian society seldom offered women any formal \npportunity to take up prostitution as a career, but half-deliberately \nlooked the other way as many hundreds of young girls "fell" into it. \nEighteenth-century London swarmed with female children strug- \ngling to keep themselves alive by prostitution, according to a \ncontemporary pamphlet denouncing "little Creatures piled in Heaps \nupon one another, sleeping in the public streets, in the most rigorous \nseasons, and some of them whose Heads will hardly reach above the \nWaistband of a Man\'s Breeches, found to be quick with Child, and \nbecome burdensome to the Parish." Far from extending sympathy to \nthese little girls, the pamphleteer called them wicked whores, "a most \nenormous Sin to lay Snares for the Unwary, and to be the Means of \nruining both Souls and Bodies of so many innocent young \nGentlemen." 61 \n\nAccording to the terminology of the time, a "wench" was a child \nof either sex. Dryden\'s description of a gentleman as one who "eats, \ndrinks, and wenches abundantly" apparently meant a man who picked \nup homeless male or female children in the streets to service his \nsexual idiosyncrasies. Later, "wench" came to mean only a lower-class \nfemale, a servant or peasant available for a gentleman\'s sexual use. 62 \n\nBy the 19th century, thousands of girls under the age of 14 were \nlisted on English police registers as "common prostitutes." London in \n1860 had at least 500 registered prostitutes under the age of 1 3, and \n1 500 more under the age of 16. Victorian gentlemen had a taste for \nraping child virgins, who commanded the highest prices in whore- \nhouses. Experienced child whores were taught to imitate the cries \nand struggles of a newly deflowered victim, and to insert leeches or \nbroken glass into their vaginas to produce a convincing flow of \nblood. 63 \n\nJosephine Butler\'s investigations of the English system of prostitu- \ntion led to legislation to raise the "age of consent" to 14; still, large \n\n\n\n825 \n\n\n\nProvidence numbers of younger girls were captured and immured in brothels. "The ! \n\nPsyche law was lax on the matter of abduction, and the punishment for \n\n.____ _^__^_ trafficking in girls was derisory." Male authorities took an interest in \nprostitution only after they clearly understood its connection with \nrampant venereal disease. Legal regulation of brothels was instituted \nthen; but this didn\'t mean closing them. It meant subjecting them to \nmedical inspections, so they would be safe for male patrons. 64 \n\nWhores were not considered full-fledged human beings. The \n18th-century term for a whore was "a fleshy convenience." 65 The \nword "convenience" also meant an outhouse. One might say that from \nthe revered sacred harlot of antiquity to this was a long road \nbackward. \n\n1. Lamusse, 138. 2. Briffault 3, 169. 3. Malvern, 49. 4. Assyr. &Bab. Lit, 170. \n5.

In Christian usage, Providence was sometimes a \nsynonym for God; but many mystics defined Providence as a female \ndeity. 2 \n\n1. Funk, 275. 2.

Classical myth \nwedded Psyche to the love-god Eros: a union of soul with body. \nApuleius\'s version said Psyche and her bridegroom could come \ntogether only in the dark. When Psyche insisted on seeing Eros by the \nlight of her lamp, he had to leave her forever. 1 As an allegory, this \nsaid the passion of the soul might banish sexual passion.

"Sometimes children Pudens, Pudenziana \n\nwere born before the pair had ever seen each other\'s faces by day." 2 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nPsyche was incarnate in a butterfly, for the early Greeks believed \nhuman souls could occupy flying insects while passing from one life \nto the next. The belief was not forgotten. At Carcassonne in 1 329 an \namorous Carmelite monk was accused of witchcraft for hiding love \ncharms in women\'s houses. It was charged that he also called up Satan \nand sacrificed a butterfly to him, in symbolic offering of the soul. 3 \n\n1. E. Hamilton, 92-100. 2. Crawley, 42. 3. J. B.

According to the Christian legend, \nPudenziana was the usual virgin convert, a daughter of Pudens, a \nwealthy patrician. Peter and Paul lodged in the house of Pudenziana on \ntheir (mythical) visit to Rome. With the help of a holy man named \nPastorus (Shepherd), St. Pudenziana soaked up the blood of Christian \nmartyrs in sponges, which she hid in a well. 1 This tale was often cited \nto account for the numerous bottles of martyrs\' blood used as healing \nrelics in countless churches. \n\nThe well with its holy blood probably meant the yonic "pit" \niputeus) in the Forum, where the spirits of blessed ancestors dwelt. \nThe Shepherd Pastorus was a form of the Psychopomp or Conductor of \nSouls, sometimes called Shepherd of the Stars. \n\n1. Brewster, 250-51. \n\n\n\n827 \n\n\n\nPurgatory Purgatory \n\nOne of several Christian doctrines derived more or less directly from \n^i^""^"^""" Buddhism. Five centuries before the Christian era, Buddhist priests \nclaimed to be able to deliver one\'s ancestors from pains of atonement \nin the underworld and to cause them to be born again in heaven, by \nreciting magic words and performing sacrifices on their behalf for a \nfee paid by the pious descendant. 1 "Above all," Buddhist scriptures said, \n"it is necessary to obtain the aid of priests who deliver these bound \nsouls by the ritual." 2 \n\nThe Christian doctrine of purgatory implied that priests had the \npower to send to heaven individuals who might otherwise have been \ndamned. Some stories hinted that the privilege could be carried too far. \nPope Gregory the Great succeeded in praying the emperor Trajan \nout of purgatory and into heaven, but God punished Gregory with gout, \nfever, and stomach pains for his sin of praying for a heathen. 3 \n\nThe Catholic notion of purgatory was renounced by Protestants, \nwho were scornful of anything resembling the sale of salvation. \nReginald Scot remarked that in England the ghosts no longer pestered \nthe living to be prayed out of purgatory: "Where are the spirits? Who \nheareth their noises? Who seeth their visions? Where are the souls that \nmade such moan ... to be eased of their pains in purgatory?" He \nconcluded that they had all gone to Italy, because masses had become \ntoo expensive in England. 4 \n\nThe word purgatory was often applied to the pagan womb-shrine \nor abaton used in initiations in pre-Christian times (see Abaddon). A \ncandidate would "descend into an underground chamber, simulate \ndeath, undergo great trials, and experience a rebirth into a new life. \nThe early Christian Church continued this custom, calling such pagan \nshrines \'purgatories.\' The most celebrated purgatory during medieval \ntimes was the one at Lough Derg (Red Lake) in County Donegal, \nIreland, to which pilgrimages were made in the twelfth century in \nhonor of St. Patrick, for whom the purgatory was named." Though \nPope Alexander VI declared it a residence of devils and ordered it \nclosed in 1497, St. Patrick\'s Purgatory was still in use in 1790. 5 \n\nAccording to a 1 5th-century illustration for the Divine Comedy, \npurgatory was not a pit or cave but a mountain, constructed in \nwedding-cake levels very like a ziggurat. At the summit was the Earthly \nParadise, where a nude male and female figure were joined together \nin a sacred marriage: a peculiar link between the ancient King and \nGoddess mating at the pinnacle of the ziggurat, and the conventional \nbride-and-groom dolls on the wedding cake. 6 The implication of the \npicture was that, once the sinner had expurgated his sins and moved \nup the stages of the mountain, he too could enter the love-paradise at \nthe top: a strange image for a Christian article of faith. \n\n1.

Yahweh \nis never mentioned in the Book of Esther, because the Elamite Jews \ndidn\'t know him. They worshipped Ishtar\'s spouse Marduk, who \nappears in the book as Mordecai. \n\nPurim is the Feast of Lots, because the original Elamite festival \nwas based, in turn, on the Hittite Purulli, where a sacred-king-victim \nwas chosen by casting lots, or by a competition. 1 The victim in the \nJewish Purim was Haman, the same as the Libyan sacrificial god \nAmon. \n\nHaman lay with the Goddess, Ishtar-Esther, then was slain by \nMarduk-Mordecai (Esther 7:8). Afterward, his flesh was sacramental- \nly eaten, as he is still eaten symbolically at Purim in the form of \nhamantaschen, small triangular pastries in the Goddess\'s sacred delta \nshape. Egyptian bakers made similar three-cornered cakes to represent \nthe Host or victim in festivals of Amon. 2 \n\nThe story of Esther is an allegorical tale of the intercession of \nIshtar, whom the Jews worshipped at the time, with the king who was \nsupposed to be her consort, on behalf of the subject Jewish tribes. \nInterwoven with this theme is that of the ritual sacrifice. Haman was \ngiven a Last Supper and a night of the Goddess-queen\'s love. Then he \nwas hanged on the high gallows that was "prepared for Mordecai" \nthat is, he became the god Marduk and assumed the trappings of \ndivinity (Esther 7:10). \n\nThe Jews also worshipped Marduk, who had originally "divided \nthe waters which were under the firmament from the waters which \nwere above the firmament" (Genesis 1 :7) by splitting the Water-mother \nTiamat. In the Book of Esther, Jewish scribes made Marduk one of \ntheir own sacred ancestors. Marduk helped the Jews kill 75,000 of their \nenemies, apparently by magic, for they "laid not their hands on the \nprey" (Esther 9:16). \n\n1. Hooke, M.E.M., 99. 2. Budge, D.N., 75. \n\n\n\nPurple \n\nFrom Latin purpureus, "very, very holy," or sacer, or taboo. 1 The \nancients\' "royal purple" was not purple but a dark wine red, the color of \nblood, especially the menstrual blood formerly considered the very \nstuff of life. Royal purple meant the same as royal blood: matrilineal \nkinship in a sacred clan. Some legends said royal purple descended \nfrom Athene\'s "goatskin dyed red," the aegis of sovereignty. 2 The \npurple robe of a Roman emperor was said to have been "colored by \nblood." 3 Purple still meant blood color in the time of Shakespeare, who \n\n\n\nPurple \n\n\n\n829 \n\n\n\nPurusha \nPyerun \n\n\n\nFirst Book of \n\nAdam and Eve One of \n\nthe legendary \napocrypha (works \nwritten in Greek \nfrom Jewish sources) \ngiving additional \ndetails or alternative \nversions of the \nGenesis myths. \n\n\n\nspoke of the "purpled hands" of Caesar\'s assassins, stained with "the \nmost noble blood of all the world." \n\nWhen Mark\'s Gospel says Jesus\'s robe was purple (15:17) and \nMatthew\'s Gospel says it was scarlet (27:28), they are really talking \nabout the conventional sacred-king robe of moon-blood-color. Babylo- \nnian kings wore the same dark-red robe, called lamhussu. It was the \nsame sacred blood color that covered altars in Canaan and Israel \n(Numbers 4), and dyed the "red carpet" trod by triumphal religious \nprocessions/ \n\nBlood-purple was sacred to the pagans, as suggested by the First \nBook of Adam and Eve, which says the art of dyeing crimson and \npurple was invented by Satan. 5 \n\nActually, the art was invented by the Phoenicians, who obtained \ndeep-blood-red dye from mollusks of the family Muricidae. These sea \nsnails were the source of the famous "Tyrian purple" worn by royalty. 6 \nIn Roman society, people just below imperial rank were allowed to \nwear stripes or borders of the holy color on their togas, in smaller widths \naccording to a descending scale of status. \n\n1.

The earth plane lay \nat her waist, seven concentric hells below in the pelvis, seven more in \nthe legs. Fourteen corresponding heavens mounted through the thorax \nand head: 28 in all, like the 14 levels descended by Osiris on his way \nto the Pit, and 14 more ascended into heaven one night for each \nmaking a full lunar cycle. Egyptian priests said the World Body was \nthe Goddess Neith. 1 However, ascetic Jain Buddhists rendered the \nPurusha sexually neutral. Later, medieval Europe adopted the idea \nbut made the World Body wholly male. 2 \n\nThe highest heaven, which Greeks called the Empyrean, spread as \na shining umbrella over the head of Purusha. On the earth plane, \ncontinents and oceans were arranged in concentric rings, like a horizon- \ntal target. 3 This image was still found in medieval geographies. \n\n1 . Budge, G.E. 2, 299. 2.

Pygmies still live as they did 3000 years ago, in the jungle near \nthe Ruwenzori Range (Mountains of the Moon). This area was \nrendered virtually inaccessible from the north when climatic changes \ncreated a vast swamp, now known as the Sudd, between Nilotic \ncivilizations and the mountain headwaters. But in an earlier age, \nAfrica\'s topography was more congenial to travel and colonization. \n\nPygmies say their ancestors came from the northern land of Kimi, \na Coptic name for Egypt, derived from Khemennu, "Land of the \nMoon." The pygmies\' culture hero Efe was sometimes called Heru, an \nold Egyptian name for Horus. He was crucified on a World Tree, \nand received a revelation of holy law from a lunar spirit named Mara, \nthe old pygmy name for a tribal matriarch, then for any divine \npersonage. 1 \n\nLike their relatives the Bushmen, pygmies are caucasoid people: \nthin-lipped, light-skinned, often blue-eyed. Anthropological investiga- \ntions show the pygmies were not true primitives but remnants of a \nformerly sophisticated race, the proto-Berber people inhabiting what \nHallet called "old white Africa." 2 Pygmies have about the same stature \nas Egyptian mummies; the ancient Egyptians were not large people. \n\nEgypt had a pygmy god, Bes, patron of music, dancing, and \nentertainment. He seems to have been an imported court jester to the \ngods. "They delighted in his grotesque figure and contortions, just as \nthe Memphite Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom enjoyed the antics of \ntheir pygmies." Bes became almost as popular as Osiris. He protected \nwomen, especially pregnant ones. He preserved families, looked after \nthe dead in the underworld, and attended the infant sun god at his birth. \nLater, Bes was diabolized along with all other Egyptian deities. He \nwas called a "wicked demon\' exorcised by Moses. He is said to dwell still \nin the southern gate of the temple of Karnak, whence he threatens \nsolitary travelers. 3 \n\nPygmies retain matriarchal traditions from their original source. \nThey say the first human beings were made by the moon. The first \nwoman, Mother of God, was Matu (Mother), who still dwells in caverns \n\n\n\n831 \n\n\n\nP V ntia under the Mountains of the Moon. Sometimes she was seen as a cat- \n\nPython headed deity like Egypt\'s Bast. Her name was a cognate of Maat and \n\n^^^^^^^^^ also of the Sumerian Matu, the primal womb, the underworld, and \n^"^^^^^^^^^ the devourer of the dead. In Babylon the Death-goddess Matu was also \nLilith, or the yonic lotus lilu. Now the pygmies say their Goddess can \ntake the form of a monster named Lulu, with a vast vulva-mouth that \nopens vertically instead of horizontally, and swallows human beings \nheadfirst. 4 \n\nNot only are the pygmy myths and deities derived from those of \nthe ancient world, but their traditional stories plainly speak of the time \nwhen their ancestors lived in a high state of civilization, in great cities, \nwith wonderful tools to use, and skills that enabled them to work \nmiracles. 5 \n\nThe true origin of these people cannot be known precisely, any \nmore than the origin of any other nonliterate group. Yet it seems \nclear that they did have a connection with Nilotic culture at a very early \ndate, possibly even as colonial villages along the upper reaches of the \nNile. Even in dynastic Egypt there were half-forgotten stories about the \n"true source" of the Nile at the Goddess\'s lunar mountain with its \nvast uterine cave. Later the ceremonial source of the Nile was located at \nElephantine, because it became too difficult to travel upriver beyond \nthis point. In the end, the pygmies were cut off. \n\n1.

Like \nthe serpent-and-dove deities of Mesopotamia, he combined avian and \nreptilian attributes; he was called the Feathered Serpent. \n\nHe gave blood from his penis to re-create the human race after the \nFlood and so became one of the "castrated Fathers." l He was \nsacrificed; he descended into hell; he rose again from the dead. His \nSecond Coming was expected. \n\nLike the dead and living Shiva, like Njord and Frey, Horus and \nSet, Apollo and Python, etc., Quetzalcoatl was a two-faced deity of \ncreation and destruction, united back to back with his brother Death. 2 \nNorth American Indians also worshipped the same alternating rival \ngods as the White Manitu and the Dark Manitu, lords of life and death. \nThey were alternately sons or husbands of the Great Goddess whom \nthe tribes named Divine Grandmother. 3 Aztecs called her the Lady of \nthe Serpent Skirt, receiver of Quetzalcoatl\'s sacrifice. \n\n1.

Worshippers of Aphrodite taught that the "essential fifth" \ncame to a man during the lunar month called honey-moon, planned to \nspan a menstrual period. Aphrodite\'s nectar was also called honey. \nHorace said the kiss that sealed the marriage bond was mixed by \nAphrodite with "a fifth part of her own nectar." 2 Homer said the \nblood that flowed in the veins of gods was a blue ethereal fluid, ichor, \nprepared by Aphrodite\'s honeybees. 3 \n\nThis blue essence evolved from a confused memory of Indo- \nEuropean ancestral gods made immortal by their blue blood. Hindu \ngods are still painted blue in sacred art which may shed light on the \ncustom of the Picts and other early British tribes to paint themselves \nblue with woad for religious ceremonies, and sometimes for warfare, to \ninsure their resurrection in case of death in battle. 4 \n\nThe blue-blooded god filled with quintessence was well known to \nGnostic thinkers. Porphyry said the Demiurge or creator of the \nmaterial world was shaped like a man, with a dark blue complexion, \nexactly like Shiva, Vishnu, and other Hindu gods. 5 Aristotle taught \nthat quintessence was a fifth element after earth, water, air, and fire \nof which the bodies of gods were made. Sometimes this fifth element \nwas said to be the same as ether, the fluid of heaven. 6 \n\nMedieval alchemists described the quinta essentia as a blue elixir, \nable to confer spiritual illumination and resurrection of the body. 7 \nLater, the mystic Essential Fifth was represented by the fifth trump suit \nof the Tarot deck, the Major Arcana (Great Secrets), whose figures \nconveyed mystical doctrines to the initiated. \n\n1.

His \norigins were greatly confused by his own priests, who called him the \nsupreme deity, though the Goddess\'s priests insisted that Ra was only \nher dependent child. Many scriptures demonstrate the ideological \nbattle. \n\nDuring the Ptolemaic period, some of Ra\'s votaries rejected the \nidea that Ra was born of the Mother of the Gods; they called him \n"self-begotten and self-born." 2 A hymn addressed him as "divine \ndivinity, that came into being of himself, primeval god, that existed at \nthe beginning." But this passage was an interpolation. The same hymn \nalso said, "Thou art fair, O Ra, every day thy mother Nut embraceth \nthee." 3 \n\n\n\n837 \n\n\n\nRa One source called Ra "the divine man-child, the heir of eternity, \n\nself-begotten and self-born"; but the same source also said he was \n\n^^^^^^^^^_ "the Disc within thy mother Hathor . . . made strong each day by thy \nmother Nut." Sometimes, Ra\'s divinity depended on identifying him \nwith the Mother herself. He was told, "Thou art indeed Isis," or "Thou \nart the Great Cat," i.e., the Goddess Bast-Hathor. 4 \n\nSome writers mocked Ra\'s pretensions to divinity and considered \nhim subordinate to the Goddess Mother. He was "born yesterday \nfrom the buttocks of the goddess Mehurt ... the Great Celestial Wa- \nter." He was told, "Thy mother brought thee forth upon her hand." \nApparently the average Egyptian wouldn\'t tolerate priestly efforts to \nerase the Goddess and replace her with the kings\' solar Father. \nBudge says, "it is quite certain that there was something in the doctrines \nof the priests of Ra, or in the worship that was the practical expression \nof them, which was contrary to the instincts of the Egyptians as a \nnation." 5 \n\nWrestling with the problem of bringing their god into being \nwithout a mother, Ra\'s priests took refuge in abstractions beyond the \nunderstanding of ordinary folk: "The god hath formed himself and his \nform is not known.
