This is the center of the \nearth and the home of man. IS \n\nMarcus attributes these images of pornotopia to a spiritual loss, \npossibly related in a direct way to contemporary denial of the earth- \nmother figure in a religious symbolism, as well as Victorian society\'s \nsuppression of sexuality: \n\nOne gets the distinct impression, after reading a good deal of this \nliterature, that it could only have been written by men who at some \npoint in their lives had been starved. . . . Inside of every pornographer \nthere is an infant screaming for the breast from which he has been torn. \nPornography represents an endless and infinitely repeated effort to recap- \nture that breast, and the bliss it offered. \' 9 \n\nAcquisitiveness seems to have been another manifestation of the \nhidden psychic hunger for possession of Mother Earth. Her European \nnames Urth, Hertha, Eortha, Erda, Hretha, etc. stemmed from \nSanskrit Artha, " materia] wealth." Among the Hindu-rooted gypsies, \n"earth" meant good luck, fortune, money. 20 Latin Mater (Mother) \nbecame English "matter," of which Plutarch said, "Matter hath the \nfunction of mother and nurse . . . and containeth the elements from \nwhich everything is produced." 21 Tibetans still say the elements are \nproduced by the Old Mother. 22 The material body has the special \nname of Anna-Maya, variations of which appeared everywhere in the \nancient Mediterranean world as names of the Great Goddess. 23 The \n"soul manifested in matter" is defined as the Anna-Maya self. The sages \nsay, "Mind and matter are at base one as modes of the same Power. \n. . . Mind is the subjective and Matter the objective aspect of the one \npolarized Consciousness." 24 \n\nWestern theology split this former unity into a duality, regarding \nmatter (or flesh) and mind (or spirit) as intrinsically different from, \nand opposed to, one another. Thus, says Jung, "the word \'matter\' \nremains a dry, inhuman, and purely intellectual concept, without any \npsychic significance for us. How different was the former image of \nmatter the Great Mother that could encompass and express the \nprofound emotional meaning of Mother Earth." 25 \n\nAfter the image of Mother Earth as birth-giver, perhaps that of \nMother Earth as receiver of the dead aroused the most profound \nemotional responses. When death was viewed as a return to the infantile \nstate of sleep in the Mother\'s bosom, it seemed less terrifying. The \nRig Veda says, "Crawl to your Mother Earth. She will save you from \nthe void." 26 In medieval ballads, the hero\'s lady-love sometimes \nimpersonated Mother Earth by covering her lover with her green \n\n\n\n266 \n\n\n\nmantle, to put him "out of sight" as if buried. 27 Greek peasants Easter \n\nthought the worst kind of curse on an enemy was to wish Mother Earth \n\nwould not accept him: "May the earth not digest thee! May the black ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nearth spew thee up! May the ground not consume thee!" 28 Such a one \n\nrejected by the earth would be a revenant or a restless ghost. \n\nIn France during the 12th century, a sect of heretics were sent to \nthe stake by the Archbishop of Reims, apparently for worshipping \nMother Earth, among other offenses. Led to execution, one of them \n"cried again and again, \'O Earth, cleave asunder!\'" His hearers \nthought he was trying to get the earth to swallow his enemies, but he \nmay have believed the earth could open and swallow him to save him \nfrom the stake. 29 Like the original death aspect of Rhea or Cerridwen, \nMother Earth still was supposed to devour her children. \n\n1.

Her sacred month was Eastre- \nmonath, the Moon of Eostre. 1 \n\nSaxon poets apparently knew Eostre was the same Goddess as \nIndia\'s Great Mother Kali. Beowulf spoke of "Ganges\' waters, whose \nflood waves ride down into an unknown sea near Eostre\'s far home." 2 \n\nThe Easter Bunny was older than Christianity; it was the Moon- \nhare sacred to the Goddess in both eastern and western nations. \nRecalling the myths of Hathor- Astarte who laid the Golden Egg of the \nsun, Germans used to say the hare would lay eggs for good children \non Easter Eve. 3 (See Cat.) \n\nLike all the church\'s "movable feasts," Easter shows its pagan \norigin in a dating system based on the old lunar calendar. It is fixed as \nthe first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox, \nformerly the "pregnant" phase of Eostre passing into the fertile \nseason. The Christian festival wasn\'t called Easter until the Goddess\'s \nname was given to it in the late Middle Ages. 4 (See Menstrual \nCalendar.) \n\nThe Irish kept Easter on a different date from that of the Roman \nchurch, probably the original date of the festival of Eostre, until the \nRoman calendar was imposed on them in 632 a.d. Nevertheless, the \nColumban foundation and their colonies in Britain kept the old date \nfor another fifty years. 5 \n\nThe Persians began their solar New Year at the spring equinox, \n\n\n\n267 \n\n\n\nEcclesia and up to the middle of the 1 8th century they still followed the old \n\ncustom of presenting each other with colored eggs on the occasion. 6 \n\n^ m ^^^^ m Eggs were always symbols of rebirth, which is why Easter eggs were \n\nusually colored red the life-color especially in eastern Europe. Rus- \nsians used to lay red Easter eggs on graves to serve as resurrection \ncharms. 7 In Bohemia, Christ was duly honored on Easter Sunday and \nhis pagan rival on Eastern Monday, which was the Moon-day \nopposed to the Sun-day. Village girls like ancient priestesses sacrificed \nthe Lord of Death and threw him into water, singing, "Death swims \nin the water, spring comes to visit us, with eggs that are red, with yellow \npancakes, we carried Death out of the village, we are carrying \nSummer into the village." 8 \n\nAnother remnant of the pagan sacred drama was the image of the \ngod buried in his tomb, then withdrawn and said to live again. The \nchurch instituted such a custom early in the Middle Ages, apparently in \nhopes of a reportable miracle. A small sepulchral building having \nbeen erected and the consecrated host placed within, a priest was set to \nwatch it from Good Friday to Easter Sunday. Then the host was \ntaken out and displayed, and the congregation was told Christ was \nrisen. 9 \n\nA curious 16th-century Easter custom was known as "creeping to \nthe cross with eggs and apples," a significant use of the ancient \nfemale symbols of birth and death, beginning and fruition, the opening \nand closing of cycles. The Ceremonial of the Kings of England \nordered carpets to be laid in the church, for the comfort of the king, \nqueen, and courtiers as they crept down the aisle on hands and \nknees. 10 The penitential implication of the creeping ceremony is clear \nenough, but the female-symbolic foodstuffs are a bit mysterious. \n\nGermany applied to Easter the same title formerly given to the \nseason of the sacred king\'s love-death, Hoch-Zeit, "the High Time." \nIn English too, Easter used to be called "the Hye-Tide." n From these \ntitles came the colloquial description of any festival holiday as "a high \nold time." \n\n1.

Holy \nMother Church was both bride and mother of God, according to \nChristian mystics, postulating even an incestuous Sacred Marriage in \nthe old pagan style. The erotic poetry of Solomon\'s Song was glossed \nas an expression of the love between Christ and "Ecclesia." Irenaeus \nsaid Mary-Ecclesia was "the pure womb which regenerates man unto \n\n\n\n268 \n\n\n\nGod." As in the manner of pagan temples, even the church building \nwas likened to Mary\'s body. \n\n\n\nEcho \nEden \n\n\n\nEcho \n\nGreek "nymph" at whose reflecting pool Narcissus met his death. \nAccording to the classical myth, Echo grieved so sorely for her beloved \nflower-god that she pined away until there was nothing left of her but \nher voice. \n\nOriginally, she was Acco, the pre-Hellenic birth-goddess, in an \noracular mood as "the last echo of the Voice," meaning the Voice of \nCreation, the same as the Goddess Vac in ancient India (see Logos). In \nHebrew she was Bath Kol, Daughter of the Voice. 1 \n\nApparently the Word she spoke to the springtime god Narcissus- \nAntheus-Adonis-Hyacinthus was the death curse heralding the final \nphase of the sacred king\'s fatal drama; for Narcissus was the same god as \nDionysus with all his flower-titles. 2 \n\n1. Leland, 220. 2. Graves, G.M. 1, 288. \n\n\n\nIrenaeus Doctor, \nsaint, and father of the \nchurch, said to have \nlived in the 2nd century \na.d. as bishop of \nLyons. His history is \nobscure, largely \nbased on (possibly \nfraudulent) assertions \nof Eusebius, who \nclaimed to have \nletters from Irenaeus, \nbut none of these \nwere preserved. The \nstory of Irenaeus\'s \nmartyrdom has been \nproved false. \n\n\n\nEcstasy \n\nGreek ekstasis meant "standing forth naked," a word for the state of \n\nmind ensuing in a religious trance when the consciousness was stripped \nI away, leaving only the essential self. In Greece as in ancient India, \n\nproper worship was sometimes conducted in a state of physical naked- \nIness (Hindu digambara) to symbolize purification from all \n\ndistractions, to concentrate on the ecstatic experience. \n\n\n\nEdda \n\n"Great-Grandmother," a Norse name for Mother Earth (Erda); also \nthe word for sacred poetry inspired by her. Icelandic sagas or Eddas \nusually opened with an invocation to this Goddess, who gave birth to \nthe oldest third of the human race. 1 \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 150. \n\n\n\nsbrew "Garden of Delight," based on the Persian Heden or primal \nrden where the first couple were joined together as a bisexual being in \nGolden Age. Like all images of the earthly paradise, Eden was \nated in the far west originally, where the sun went each night. That is \nly the Bible says known lands lay "east of Eden" (Genesis 4:16). \n\n\n\n269 \n\n\n\nEdmund, Saint Edmund, Saint \n\nEgg-and-Dart Frieze \n\n\n\nCanonized form of the heathen deity worshipped at Bury St. Ed- \nmunds, where he was seasonally slain, like Shiva, in the shape of a white \nbull. \n\nRitual bull-killing dated back to the Cretan Minotaur cult, through \nrites of Artemis Tauropolos, the Roman Taurobolium, and via \nIberian paganism up to the bullfights of modern Spain. St. Edmund\'s \nshrine was supposedly founded on the tomb of the saint, a young \nman who became "chosen king" of the East Angles in the 9th century. 1 \nBut his legend was wholly mythological. Like other Celtic savior-gods \nhe was tied to a tree and pierced by many arrows: the same fate meted \nout to the sacrificial bull, still demonstrated by Spanish picadors. On \nEdmund\'s heraldic crest, the martyr\'s head was held by a wolf, the \ntraditional Doorkeeper of Death, and the Triple Goddess appeared \nsymbolically in the shape of three Crowns. (See Dog.) \n\nMonastic records reveal the true totemic nature of "St. Edmund." \nA white bull was chosen each year to be paraded through the streets, \nwhile women wishing to conceive would caress him, for a doomed god \nwas usually credited with great fertilizing power. A contract paper \nfrom the monastery said: "This indenture certifies that Master John \nSwassham, sacrist, with the consent of the prior of the convent . . . \nshall find, or cause to be found, one white bull every year of his term, so \noften as it shall happen that any gentlewoman, or any other woman, \nfrom devotion or vows made by them shall visit the tomb of the glorious \nmartyr St. Edmund to make oblation to the same white bull." 2 \n\n1.

Orphics said the Great Goddess of darkness, \nMother Night, first brought forth the World Egg which was identi- \nfied with the moon. Heaven and earth were made of the two halves of \nthe eggshell, and the first deity to emerge was the bisexual Eros the \nDesired. The Egg was a common Oriental image of creation. Its \nwestern versions "went back to cosmologies of the Tiamat-type and \nto early exchanges between Greece and the East." \' Egyptians\' signs for \nthe World Egg was the same as for an embryo in a woman\'s womb. \n\n1. Lindsay, O. A., 116. \n\n\n\nEgg-and-Dart Frieze \n\nClassical architectural decoration sometimes called the Frieze of \nVenus and Mars: a symbol of the magic circle alternating men and \nwomen. On the frieze, ovals alternate with trident-shaped darts, \n\n\n\n270 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nfemale and male genital emblems. Ancient builders carried the frieze all Eide \n\nthe way around a building or room without a break, since an El \n\ninterruption in the frieze could mean a break in the succession of i_^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhuman generations. \n\nThe same design in Egypt presented even more overtly sexual \nhieroglyphs: downward-pointing phalli alternating with narrow man- \ndorlas (female almond shapes), each topped by a small triangle \nrepresenting a clitoris. 1 \n\nThe Tantric "magic circle" or chakra was a human equivalent of \nthe Egg-and-Dart frieze. In pagan Britain, druidic priests also worked \nin magic circles alternating with green-robed dignitaries known as \nOvates, or Eggs. 2 Wearing the color associated with Life in druidic \nreligion, these must have been priestesses, like the eastern shaktis, or \nelse men impersonating women by wearing female dress. \n\nMany counting-games originated with the magic circle, in which \nthe even numbers were assigned to men, the odd numbers to \nwomen. Pagan traditions said odd numbers represented "immortality" \nbecause all odd numbers are female. 3 This explains why Roman \nreligious festivals were scheduled for odd-numbered days, on the theory \nthat these days were more propitious. \n\n1 .

Both El and its plural, \nelohim, meaning many deities of both sexes, are the Hebrew words \nrendered "God" by biblical translators. Sometimes "God" is Elias, a \nHebraic version of the sun (Greek Helios); this was the "father" Jesus \n\n\n\n271 \n\n\n\nElaine \nElements \n\n\n\naddressed (Matthew 27:47-49). In Phoenicia, El was the Heavenly Bull \nat the head of the pantheon, spouse of Asherah as Cow-Mother. He \nusually appeared as a human figure wearing the head or horns of a bull. \n\n\n\nvar. Elen, Hel-Aine, \nEileen \n\n\n\nElaine \n\nBritain\'s "Lily Maid," the virgin Moon-goddess bearing the same \nname as Helen of Troy; British tradition claimed the islands were \ncolonized by Trojans. According to the bards, the Roman emperor \nacquired Britain only by marrying its queen, Elen. The people agreed to \nhelp build Roman roads because she ordered them, and the roads \nwere called Roads of Elen of the Hosts: "The men of the Island of \nBritain would not have made those great hostings for any save for \nher." 1 \n\nElen or Elaine became the mother-bride of Lancelot-Galahad in \nArthurian romance. Lancelot the father begot on her his own \nreincarnation, Galahad the son; but Lancelot in his youth had been \nnamed Galahad, and his mother was Queen Elaine. The Lily Maid \ngave Lancelot her sexual-symbolic charm to make him invincible: her \npearl-bedewed sleeve of red silk. The womb-symbol of the Holy \nGrail was displayed in her castle, tended by her dove-soul, Colombe. \nGalahad saw this vision again in his last moments, as he expired at the \naltar in ancient sacred-king style. 2 \n\n1. Mabinogion, 85. 2. Malory I, 377; 2, 268. \n\n\n\nElectra \n\nOne of the Seven Sisters (see Pleiades); virgin mother of Dardanus, \nfounder of Troy, whose name is still borne by the Dardanelles. Electra \nwas also known as a sea nymph. Myths of the classic period made her \na "daughter" of two queens responsible for their husbands\' ritual \nmurders, Queen Clytemnestra and Queen Jocasta, who brought \ndeath to Agamemnon and Oedipus, respectively. Electra\'s name means \n"amber," and may have been applied to a priestess who wore certain \namulets of amber as a badge of office. \n\n\n\nElements \n\nOn each of the inhabited continents, the same four elements were \ndistinguished as building-blocks of all substances living or dead, organic \nor inorganic: water, fire, earth, and air. Indians of Missouri and New \nMexico, Aztecs, Chinese, Hindus, ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Ro- \nmans all had the same idea. 1 The earliest known literate \ncivilization, Sumeria, had already designated the elements water, fire, \nearth, and air. 2 The "science" of western Europe continued to \n\n\n\n272 \n\n\n\nbelieve in the same mystic elements up to the 18th century when real \nelements began to be discovered. \n\nIndo-European tradition said the four elements were created by \nGreat Mother Kali, who organized them into letter-mantras carved \non her rosary of skulls, to form the Sanskrit alphabet, which she invested \nwith power to create what it expressed. Elemental sounds were \ndivided into four categories: Va, water; Ra, fire; La, earth; and Ya, air. \nThey were bound together by the Mother-syllable Ma (Kali Ma \nherself), representing "intelligence." 3 Tibetan Buddhists still say the \nelements are ruled by "Old Mother Khon-Ma," the Great Goddess. 4 \n\nThe Goddess was addressed in scriptures: "Thou art Earth, Thou \nart Water, Thou art Fire, Thou art Air, Thou art the Void, Thou art \nconsciousness itself, Thou art life in this world; Thou art the knowledge \nof self, and Thou art the Supreme Divinity." 5 The ancient theory of \nthe human body\'s elemental "humors," adopted by the medical profes- \nsion in the west up to the 1 9th century, was based on Kali\'s supposed \ndistribution of elements in living forms. She gave water to create the \nblood stream, fire to make its vital heat, earth to produce the solid \nparts of the body, and air to animate it with breath. 6 \n\nThis theory was earnestly adopted by western philosophers. Firmi- \ncus Maternus said man is a microcosm "under the direction of \nNature ... so that within the small compass of his body he might bestow \nunder the requirements of Nature the whole energy and substance of \nthe elements." 7 \n\nThe same elemental symbols shown in the four hands of Kali \nappeared in western iconography also. Kali\'s bowl of blood signified \nwater; her scepter or dorje (lightning bolt) was fire; her lotus wheel \nstood for earth; and her sword was air. The Greeks assigned their \nown versions of these symbols to the Goddess Nemesis (Fate): a cup; an \napple-bough or wand; a wheel; and a sword. 8 Later in European \nhistory, the same symbols of the elements gave rise to the four suits of \nthe Tarot deck: (1) cups; (2) wands, rods, or scepters; (3) pentacles, \ncoins, or discs; and (4) swords. These in turn evolved into the modern \nhearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades. \n\nThe two colors now allotted to the four suits of cards echo the very \nancient Tantric concept of two sexes expressing themselves as ele- \nments. Female water and earth were paired with male fire and air. \nOriental sages maintained that mantras with a preponderance of fiery \nor airy (male) letters are cruel and destructive. Mantras with a prepon- \nderance of watery or earthy (female) letters are benevolent. 9 Like the \ncorresponding card suits in red, the life-color, female elements were said \nto possess the active, life-giving energy. Greek philosophers later \nreversed this opinion, calling male elements "active" and female ele- \nments "passive." Yet, even in the Christian Middle Ages, an \naphorism purportedly derived from Moses said, "Only Earth and Water \nbring forth a living soul." 10 \n\nAccording to Thales of Miletus, water was the Arche, the first of \n\n\n\nElements \n\n\n\nThales of Miletus \n\nPythagorean \nphilosopher, said to be \none of the Seven \nWise men of the an- \ncient world. \n\n\n\nH \n\n\n\n273 \n\n\n\nElements the elements, having "mastery" over the others because it represent- \n\ned the abyssal womb. 11 The combination of water and fire as \nh^^^i^^ female-and-male signified a very ancient theory that blood, the basic \nessence of life, was made of sea water infused by magic fire from \nheaven, which made it warm and red, though it still tasted like sea \nwater. Vedic sages sometimes called the combination Kali and Agni. \nThe Goddess, fructified by Agni\'s fire, become the Ocean of Blood \nat the beginning of the world, source of the vitality of all living things \nuntil the day of destruction. "Sacred fire" symbolized sexual passion, \nits heat engendered by fire-from-heaven gods like Agni, Lucifer, He- \nphaestus, Syrian Baal, Heracles-Melkart, Thor-Heimdall, etc. The \nfire god lost his life when he was swallowed up by the all-encompassing \nMother of Waters; sages said he was "quenched in her yoni" like a \nlightning bolt quenched in the sea. 12 (See Lightning.) This image led \nto the Roman belief that the feminine water-element was dangerous \nto men. 13 \n\nOf the other male-female pair, the air-earth combination obviously \nrepresented Father Heaven and Mother Earth, whose separation was \ncaused by their firstborn son, the god who "divided heaven from earth," \nan Oedipal myth known throughout southeastern Asia, Oceania, and \nancient Mesopotamia. \n\nEgyptians assigned a male-and-female pair to each of the primordi- \nal elements as they arose from the undifferentiated Abyss, or womb \n(Ma-Nu). These eight, together with their Great Mother, made up the \nfirst Ennead (Nine Great Deities). 14 Their elemental totems were \nassociated with the four cardinal points, the four winds, the four sides of \na Holy Mountain (pyramid), the four spirits called Sons of Horus \nwho guarded the corners of a temple. 15 These were like the four Princes \nof Heaven revered in China and Japan as guardians of the four \ncardinal directions: a blue dragon in the east, a red bird in the south, a \nwhite tiger in the west, a black warrior in the north. Three animal \nspirits and one human were the same as Egypt\'s "four powers of \nAmenti." 16 The same elemental totems gave rise to the four angels \nof the Apocalypse and the four evangelists, symbolized in Christian \niconography as a bull (earth), lion (fire), serpent (water), and eagle, \nangel, or man (air). \n\nAmerican Indians had remarkably similar elemental symbolism. \nVillages and camps were divided into four quarters or phratries of \nfire, air, water, and earth, each with its colors and totems. For example, \nthe Zunis associated wind with the north, war, and yellow; fire with \nthe south, summer, tillage, and red; water with the west, spring, peace, \nand blue; earth with the east, autumn, magic, and white. Aztec \nelemental totems were the rabbit (north, black, winter, air); the flint \n(south, blue, summer, fire); the house (east, white, autumn, earth); \nand the cane (west, red, spring, water). 17 \n\nNew World mythology postulated four primordial aeons, each \ncorresponding to an element. Sacred histories of Mexico showed that \neach of the former ages was brought to destruction by the same element I \n\n274 \n\n\n\nthat ruled it. 18 "Earth, the world support and base, became the Elements \n\niswallower of things. Air, the breath of life, became a devastating wind. \n\nFire that descends from heaven tempered as the fire-of-life in ^^__^_^_^_ \n\nlifegiving rain came down as a rain of flames. And finally Water, gentle \n\nmothering vehicle of the energies of birth, nourishment, and growth, \n\nbecame a deluge." 19 \n\nThese myths provide a clue to the original invention of the \n\nelements. Of all substances or forces in the world, why should these \n\nfour have been chosen as the basis of all things? The simple answer is \n\nthat the elements represented the only four possible ways other than \n\ncannibalism to dispose of a dead body, thus returning it to an "origin." \n\nA body could be buried in the earth, burned with fire, thrown into \n\nwater, or given to the birds of the air. Each funerary practice was viewed \n\nas a return to the same power that engendered birth. \n\nThe same four methods of corpse-disposal are still practiced all \n\ntogether in Tantric Tibet. Common folk are chopped in pieces and \n\nexposed to carrion birds, as are the Parsees of India and Persia. \n\nWealthier Tibetans are cremated, or buried if death was caused by \n\ndisease. Sometimes, as among the Hindus, corpses are thrown into \nI rivers or lakes. 20 Vedic peoples followed both funerary customs of burial \n\nand cremation, maintaining that Yama, Lord of Death, received the \n\nsoul either way. 21 \n\nSome ancient thinkers tried to classify different nations under \n\nelemental categories, possibly on the basis of funeral customs pre- \ndominating in them. It was said that water-worship belonged to Egypt \nand the Nilotic Goddess; Phrygians were worshippers of "the earth, \nwhich was to them the Great Mother of everything; the Syrians and \nCarthaginians of the air, which they adored under the name of \ncelestial Juno"; and the Persians worshipped fire. 22 \n\nA few traditions listed a fifth element that the Greeks called ether, \n"heavenly," of which the immortal bodies of gods, angels, star-spirits, \nor saints were made. It was changeless, having no part in the eternal flux \nof other elements constantly combining and re-combining. The idea \nof changeless ether was so important to western notions of the immortal \nsoul that it was never abandoned; even today some occultists call it \nthe substance of the "astral body." In the 18th and 19th centuries, \nastronomers believed ether was a gas filling all of outer space. \n\nEtheric spirits were immortal, but the other elements were also \nrepresented by spirits of a superhuman nature; undines (water), \nsalamanders (fire), gnomes (earth), and sylphs (air). Some said these \nwere pre-human races born of the four rivers that flowed from the \nGreat Mother\'s belly in the paradisial age. Elemental colors were \nassociated with these four rivers of feminine nurturing fluids: water, \nblood, honey, and milk. Oriental gemsmiths assigned to them the jewels \nof mystical significance: sapphire or lapis lazuli (water), ruby (blood \nor fire), gold (earth), and silver, crystal, or diamond (air). 2 \' According to \nbiblical symbolism, the female land was made of rivers Milk and \nHoney; the male god or ancient Savior contributed blood and water, the \n\n275 \n\n\n\nElements \n\n\n\nCompendium \n\nMalcficarum A \ntreatise on witches \nand witchcraft compiled \nby Guazzo in 1608. \n\n\n\nMichael \nConstantine Psellus \n\n1 lth-century Byzantine \npolitician, scholar, \nphilosopher, and \ncourtier; author of a \nHistory, poems, and \nletters on many \nsubjects. \n\n\n\nvery same fluids that flowed from the body of Jesus in the "land of \nmilk and honey" (John 19:34). \n\nThe philosophical sect called Stoics after stoicheia, "the ele- \nments" assigned color symbolism, signs of the zodiac, seasons, and \ndeities to the elements. 24 Their system passed into the Roman Circus, \nwhich was divided into four elemental regions with their colors: green \nfor Spring, Earth, Flowers, Terra Mater, and Venus; red for Summer, \nFire, and Mars; blue for Autumn, Water, Heaven, Saturn, and \nNeptune; white for Winter, Air, Zephyrs, and Jupiter. 25 The same \ndeities were still connected with the elements in the 16th century \na.d.: Venus (water), Mars (fire), Jove (earth), and Saturn (air). \n\nThe Compendium MaleEcarum quoted Psellus\'s list of elemental \nspirits in defining various kinds of devils in the Middle Ages. "The \nfirst is the fiery, because these dwell in the upper air and will never \ndescend .... The second is the aerial, because these dwell in the air \naround us. . . . The third is terrestrial . . . some dwell in the fields and \nlead night travelers astray; some dwell in hidden places and caverns. \n. . . The fourth is the aqueous, for these dwell under the water in rivers \nand lakes. . . . They raise storms at sea, sink ships in the ocean, and . . . \nare more often women than men." 26 According to Scot, fire-spirits \ngovern the intellect, water-spirits the instincts and passions: "Fiery \nspirits urge men to contemplation, watery spirits to lust." 27 Sexual \nprejudices entered into these definitions, for the supposed sexual \npolarity of fire and water was never forgotten. \n\nThe human "temperament" came from Latin temperare, "to mix, \nto combine"; temperament was a mixture of elemental "humors" or \nfluids. These were supposed to be controlled by various gods associated \nwith the elements. Thus, a character could be Martial, Jovial, \nSaturnine, or Mercurial. A predominance of blood gave a sanguine \ntemperament; of phlegm, a phlegmatic one; of bile, a melancholic \none; of ether, an ethereal one; and so on. The temperamental mixture \nwas also related to tempor, the time or season, for the elements were \ncategorized also with the four seasons of the year and various configura- \ntions of the stars. 28 These ideas were old even before Rome was built. \nThe legendary ancestor of the Scythians was said to have arranged all \nthings in the world under four elemental symbols that came down \nfrom heaven: a plough (earth), a bowl (water), an ax (fire), and a yoke \n(air, the "yoke" between heaven and earth, related to the word \nyoga). 19 In general, the lore of the elements was a prime example of \nwhat may be one of humanity\'s most characteristic behavior patterns: \nclassifying. \n\nI.

After dispatching his victim, Shiva put on ^^^^^^^ \n\nthe elephant\'s skin and turned himself elephantine, while "watched \n\n| by the Goddess-spouse." \' In the erotic poem Song of the Cowherd, the \n\ni god was incarnated as Krishna and the Goddess-spouse as his sexually \n\ninsatiable consort Radha, "She-Elephant." Radha was named for an \n\nelephant because elephants were common symbols of the most \n\npowerful sexual energies. The Kama Sutra designated "elephant men" \n\nand "elephant women" those with the largest genitals and most \n\nvoracious sexual appetites. Yet Radha was entirely human, described as \n\nWoman, "the object of devotion to which even God, the Creator \n\nhimself, bows down." 2 \n\nA male elephant was often given the title of Begetter, or Father, or \nGrandfather. 3 Buddha was begotten on the virgin Maya by the \nelephant god under his title of Ganesha, "Lord of Hosts," most \nprobably derived from the use of elephants in warfare. 4 Every history \nstudent knows North African war leaders considered the magic of \nelephants so essential to victory that the Carthaginian general Hanni- \npal insisted on trying to take them over the Alps to attack Rome from \nthe north a disastrous tactical misjudgment, resulting in the loss of \nall his elephants and his war as well. \n\nThe elephant-god "Lord of Hosts" had a flourishing worship in \nNorth Africa and Egypt, which is why this same title was taken by the \n[biblical Yahweh, who was identified with the elephant god at his sacred \npity of Elephantine during the 5th century B.C. 5 Jewish mercenary \nsoldiers stationed there insisted that their god was the same as the \nklephant-mate of the Virgin Mother Neith, or Anath: the two of \npern were totemized as Cow and Bull Elephant at what was then called \npe source of the Nile. 6 Elephants were worshipped as sexual- \npymbolic deities in Egypt from an early date. Totem standards showing \nelephants, and artifacts of elephant ivory, appeared in pre-dynastic \n(times. 7 \n\nJudeo-Christian scholars tended to ignore Yahweh\'s involvement \nIn the elephant cult because, as Hooke says, "it is naturally repugnant \nto most people [i.e., men] to entertain the suggestion that Jahveh could \never have been thought of as possessing a female consort like all the \npaals of Canaan"; and for no more reason than this allegedly natural \nrepugnance, evidence of the sacred marriage at Elephantine was \nsuppressed. Yet the same author admitted that Jahveh was once one of \nthe very same Baals, and even addressed as Baal in the Bible. 8 \n\nA curious parallel to the Flight into Egypt of Yahweh\'s son is \nfound in Buddhist iconography. The Virgin Mother was shown \nriding a white bull, led by Shiva in the costume of a peasant, holding in \ntier arms the elephant-headed Divine Child, the reborn Ganesha. 9 \nPossibly the original Egyptian version of this reborn god entered the \nBible under the name of Behemoth, who became an elephant- \nlieaded demon in the later mythology of western Europe. \n\n277 \n\n\n\nElias, Saint The elephant still symbolizes the sacred marriage in a Buddhist \n\nElizabeth, Saint fertility ritual. Monks lead a painted white elephant in solemn \n\nmm ^^^ ma ^^am^m procession, attended by men wearing women\'s clothes and making \nsalacious jokes. "Through this ritualistic female disguise they do \nhonor to the cosmic female principle, the maternal, procreative, feeding \nenergy of nature, and by the ritualistic utterance of licentious lan- \nguage stimulate the dormant sexual energy of the living power." 10 The \nsame transvestism and lewd language can be found in fertility rituals \nthe world over. \n\n1.

Eusebius built upon the name alone a nonsensical Christian \nmyth, calling Elias one of five Egyptians who were "questioned" at the \ngate of Caesarea and gave their names and their city, Jerusalem. \n"The governor ordered them to be tortured to exhort more precise \ninformation; but they remained mute and were beheaded." 2 \n\nl.Lawson, 44. 2.

She was a mother at 14, \na widow at 20, and a corpse at 24, having died of an excess of \nChristianity. \n\nHer spiritual advisor was Conrad von Marburg, who loved to strip \nboth Elizabeth and her maids and mercilessly whip them for the \nslightest infraction of his orders. On one occasion the young Landgra- \nvine was invited to visit a nunnery and went without asking his \npermission. He beat her so severely that "for three weeks the marks of \nthe cords could be seen upon her." After her husband\'s death, other \nnobles robbed her of her estates and left her destitute; von Marburg \nordered her to send away her last few friends and her children. She \nsaid, "I fear a mortal man as much as I should fear the heavenly Judge. \nTherefore I have given my obedience to Master Conrad . . . that I \nmight be bereft of every earthly consolation." l \n\nShe inflicted further austerities on herself, in addition to the abuse \nshe received from von Marburg, and soon died of these physical \nhardships. Conrad von Marburg pulled political strings to have her \n\n\n\n278 \n\n\n\ncanonized, to enhance his own reputation as her teacher. He busied \nhimself in the torture chamber a task plainly suited to his personal- \nityand was credited with bringing 8000 heretics to the stake in a \nsingle year. At last he was assassinated by a group of irate knights, \nagainst whom he had preached a crusade. 2 He was promptly canon- \nized as a saint and a martyr. 5 \n\n1. de Voragine, 684. 2.

In \nthe original manuscripts of the book of Genesis, Yahweh was only \none of the elohim. Sometimes the singular form was taken as a name, \ne.g. the Phoenician bull-god called simply El, "the god." l \n\nMedieval wizards thought Elohim was one of the magical secret \nnames of God; or, at times, it was taken to be the name of a devil. \n\n1 . Lamusse, 74. \n\n\n\nElohim \nElves \n\n\n\nElves \n\nSpenser said the word "elf meant "alive." \' But there is little doubt \nthat elves were the ancestral dead, still "alive" in their burial mounds; "it \nis well known that in Scandinavia the dead were formerly called \n\'elves.\' " 2 The Kormaks Saga, pagan Icelandic poem of the 10th \ncentury, described sacrifices to them for curative purposes: "Redden \nthe outside of the mound with bull\'s blood, and make the elves a feast \nwith the flesh; and you will be healed." 3 \n\nThe paradise of Alfaheimr (Elf-land) was always matriarchal, \ninhabited by the bright female spirits who made the sun. Like their \neastern counterparts the dakinis, these Valkyries or fairies could be \nboth beautiful and hideous, representing both birth and death. 5 In the \nnew creation after doomsday, the new female sun would be Glory-of- \nElves. 6 \n\nChristianity opposed this ancient female-centered theology, as \nshown by accounts of elf-feasts as demonic sabbats where "cloven- \nfooted dancers" trod their fairy rings. Henry More, 17th century \nEnglish philosopher and poet, said they often appeared in northern \nEngland and in Ireland. 7 Ballads merged the demon lover with the "elf- \nknight," a wooer from pagan northlands. 8 The custom of the Wild \nHunt or Night Ride, sacred to the elf-king (Odin), was transformed into \na procession of wind-riding demons, as at Halloween and other \nIpagan festivals. Leader of the night riders was called the Erl King, from \nDanish eherkonge, a king of those who belong to Hel. He associated \nwith the sacred alder tree. 9 \n\n\n\nThe word elf was \nrelated to the helleder, \npeople belonging to \nMother Hel as Death- \ngoddess. In general it \nmeant heathen, both \ndead and living. \nSigvat Thordarson in \nthe 11th century \ncalled heathen people \nalfar, "elves," who \nworshipped their deities \nat feasts called \nalfablot (elf-blood) in \ncertain "heathen- \nholy" houses ruled by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 \n\n\n\nElysium \nEndymion \n\n\n\nOther plants often associated with elves were the holly sacred to \nHel, the mistletoe, the mandrake, and various witch-herbs including \nrosemary, known as the Elfin Plant, 10 named after the Goddess herself. \n(See Rose.) \n\nl.Keightley,57. 2.

It was once thought that male genitals were \nrotruding ends of intestines, literally "testes-within." Egyptian sma \nneant both entrails and male genitals. 1 Egyptians prayed to be delivered \nm the day of reckoning from a Kali-like death-goddess Baba, who not \n>nly "devoured" men sexually but also "feeds on the entrails of the \nlead." 2 \n\nKali devoured her lover genitally and also devoured his entrails at \nfie same time. 5 Similarly, Aphrodite in her Crone form as Andro- \nihonos, Man-Slayer, killed her lovers as a queen bee does by ripping \nut their intestines along with their genitals. 4 In northern Europe \nhere was the same ceremony: spring was brought to the world by \npibolically ripping out the entrails of Loki via a rope tied around his \nenitals. His blood bathed the lap (womb) of the Goddess; then she \npiled, and the spring could come. 5 See Skadi. \n\nBecause men\'s "guts" were supposed to possess the spirit of the \n\nhallic god, also mythologized as the underground serpent, it was \n\nsual to take omens from the entrails of sacrificial victims. Among the \n\nLmazonian tribes of the Black Sea area, the readers of entrails were \n\nold gray-haired women." 6 The Romans called similar diviners haruspi- \n\n(es, "those who gaze into the belly." 7 \n\n1.

Jesus, John the Baptist, and Simon Magus were said to have \nbeen trained in Essenic communities, which formed the bulk of the \nfirst Christians. Epiphanius said, "They who believed on Christ were \ncalled Essenes before they were called Christians." l \n\nAn Essenic hierarchy included a chief priest called Christos \n(Anointed One), "head of the entire Congregation of Israel." There \nwere ordinary priests called "sons of Aaron," and another functionary \nknown as the Messiah of Israel. 2 The latter was also called Teacher of \nRighteousness. He suffered physical abuse in atonement for the sins of \nthe entire community, enduring "vindictive sentences of scourging \nand the terrors of painful sicknesses, and vengeance on his fleshly \nbody."\' \n\nJosephus said the Essenes "reject pleasures as an evil, but esteem \n\n\n\nEpiphanius Sainted \n4th-century father of \nthe church, friend \nof St. Jerome, writer of \nmany tracts and \npolemics against \npaganism. \n\n\n\n283 \n\n\n\nEssenes continence, and the conquest over our passions, to be virtue. They \n\nneglect wedlock, but choose out other persons\' children, while they are \n^^^^^^^ pliable, and fit for learning; and esteem them to be of their kindred, \nand form them according to their own manners." We are not told \nwhether these "other persons\' children" were abandoned by their \nparents, or sold, or given to, or kidnapped by, the Essenes. These harsh \nanchorites imposed cruel sentences for the least infraction of rules, \npartial starvation being the most common punishment. Some suffered \npunishments lasting two or more years for wavering from the doc- \ntrines of the community. 4 \n\nThe doctrines were strikingly similar to those of early Christianity. \nEssenes anticipated St. Augustine in teaching that immortal souls \nbelonged in heaven, but were drawn down to earth and entrapped in \ncorruptible flesh by the "natural enticement" of sex. 5 The soul\'s \npurity might be recovered by ascetic techniques such as mortification of \nthe flesh, fasting, renunciation of sensual pleasures, and by solitary \nmeditation in the wilderness, like the voluntary exiles of John and Jesus. \n\nEssenes called themselves Therapeutae, "healers," claiming their \naustere lifestyle gave them power to cast out demons of sickness, even \nto restore life to the dead; Jesus\'s raising of Lazarus was a typical Essenic \nmiracle. 6 Much of their training as exorcists consisted of learning lists \nof spirits\' names, and the holy names that would expel them. Like Jesus \nin the episode of the Gadarene swine, Essenes always demanded the \ndemons\' names. (See Name.) They were sworn to strictest secrecy \nregarding the magical names they used in their exorcisms. 7 \n\nEssenes preached giving away all one\'s worldly goods upon joining \nthe sect, which meant those who joined gave away everything they \nowned to their superiors. Dire punishments were meted out to those \nwho lied about their possessions in order to hold something back for \nthemselves or their families. 8 An Essenic episode in the Gospels tells of \nAnanias and his wife Sapphira, killed by St. Peter for giving the \napostles only a part, but not all, of the money they received for a sale of \nland. Peter and his associates were jailed for murder, but later escaped \n(Acts 5:2-10, 18). \n\nDespite their vows of poverty, the Essenes were strangely obsessed \nwith visions of wealth and power coming to them after Armageddon, \n"The War of the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness." 9 Sons of \nLight of course were the Essenes, and all others outside their \nbrotherhood were Sons of Darkness, otherwise called "men of the \nPit." 10 The Essenes believed firmly in the imminence of the Last \nDays, when they would be called upon to fight the forces of evil. Their \nreward would be to rule the world in an oddly materialistic manner, \nas envisioned by their scriptures: \n\nArise, O Warrior, take thy captives, O glorious man! Seize thy plunder, O \ndoer of mighty deeds! Lay thy hand on the necks of thy enemies and \nthy foot on the heaps of the slain; smite the nations, thy adversaries, and \nmay thy sword devour guilty flesh Let there be a multitude of \n\n\n\n284 \n\n\n\n\n\n\npossessions in thy fields, silver and gold and precious stones in thy palaces. Esther \n\n...Let thy gates be continuously open, that the wealth of the nations \n\nmay be brought unto thee; and let their kings serve thee, and all the _^^^^__^^___ \n\noppressors bow down to thee and lick the dust of thy feet. " \n\nA large colony of Essenes occupied the Qumran community \nfrom 1 10 B.C. to the fall of Jerusalem in 70 a.d. with a significant period \nof vacancy during the reign of Herod, 31-4 B.C. In 31 b.c. the site \nhad to be abandoned because a severe earthquake cracked the water \ncistern and ruined the buildings. 12 \n\nSurvivors evidently took the earthquake as a sign of the oncoming \nLast Days and went forth into the world to preach their message. \nJosephus said before 70 a.d. there were many Messiahs and Christs \nannouncing the end of the world. 15 Some were willing to die a \nmartyr\'s death, believing this would gain them special privileges in the \nworld of the hereafter. One such martyr may have been John the \nBaptist, who came from the wilderness to call Herod and his court to \nrepentance, and remained to serve as a sacred king (see Salome). \n\nEarly Mandaean Christians said the true prophet was not Jesus but \nJohn the Baptist. They called themselves Christians of St. John, and \nalso Nasoraje, or "Nazarenes." H One of the colonies of exiled hermits \nfrom Qumran settled around Nazareth and took up the craft of \ncarpentry; hence the craft-brotherhood of Nazorenes, from najjar, \n"carpenters," after whom the town may have been named. Some \nChristian authorities of the first centuries a.d. wrote that during this \nperiod "all Christians were called Nazorenes." 15 Jesus too was called \na Nazorene. The oldest Gospel called him "Jesus the carpenter" (Mark \n6:3). \n\nOddly, what began in the east as a carpenters\' metaphor passed \ninto the Gospels as a masons\' metaphor. Essene-like Buddhist her- \nmits described themselves as logs rejected by the carpenter\'s craft. 16 The \nsame words were put into Jesus\'s mouth, somewhat altered: he called \nhimself a stone rejected by the masons (Matthew 21:42). \n\n1.

The biblical Book \nof Esther is a secularized Elamite myth of Ishtar (Esther) and her \nconsort Marduk (Mordecai), who sacrificed the god Hammon, or \nAmon (Haman). Yahweh was never mentioned, because the Jews of \nElam worshipped Marduk, not Yahweh. (See Purim.) \n\nEsther probably was the name given to any priestess chosen to \nrepresent the Goddess on the occasion of the king\'s sacred marriage. \n\n\n\n285 \n\n\n\nEthan Even the Bible story admits that Esther-Ishtar was not the real name of \n\nEuphemia, Saint the Elamite-Jewish queen.

He was the Sumerian god-king Etana, called \nEytan in the land of Canaan. He ascended to heaven on eagle-back, \nlike Ganymede, to reach the Goddess and learn the secret of eternal life. \nHe came down again to earth, some said thrown down by the jealous \nsun god for his hubris. 1 Evidently he returned to earth to be reincarnat- \ned in the next king.

Her legend claimed she was one of the \nwomen who entered a Christian sect by "turning herself into a man," \nfor some sects would not admit women unless they did this. 1 St. \nEugenia accordingly became a monk and called herself Brother \nEugenius. The same story told of all she-monks was told of her: she was \nfalsely accused of rape and condemned to a life of expiation, which \nshe patiently endured. Still, the healing miracles attributed to her shrines \nwere older than her Christian legend, showing that she was really the \nGoddess whose "eugenic" springs were even more popular in the 1st \ncentury than Lourdes or Compostela in the 20th. 2 \n\n1 .

She stood aloft on \na high place, and could not be reached except with ladders; those who \nclimbed up to pull her down were afraid, because the first of their \nnumber had been stricken with paralysis upon touching her and was \nborne away half dead. 1 That is, she was a holy image protected by so \nstern a taboo that even early Christians feared to violate it. \n\n1. de Voragine, 552. \n. \n\n\n\nEuropa \nEurynome \n\n\n\nEuropa \n\n"Full Moon," the Great Goddess as mother of the entire continent. \nShe was embodied in the same white Moon-cow as Hathor, Hera, Io, \nand Kali who "rode" Shiva in the guise of the white bull Nandi, \njust as Europa rode Zeus disguised as a white bull. 1 Her Hellenic legend \nsaid Zeus kidnapped and raped her; but it was "deduced from pre- \nHellenic pictures of the Moon-priestess triumphantly riding on the \nSun-bull, her victim." 2 Garlanded white bulls were sacrificed to the \nlunar cow-goddess in Crete and Mycenae from a very early date. \nAccording to Pausanias, Europa was a surname of the ancient \nMycenaean goddess, Demeter.* \n\n1.

He too \nbecame too arrogant and had to be punished for forgetting his Mother. 2 \nSee Eve. \n\nLike many titles of the Great Goddess, Eurynome was both \ndiabolized and masculinized by later Christian writers, who con- \nsigned her to hell and made her a male "demon Eurynome," sometimes \ndescribed as a Prince of Death. 3 \n\n1.

She was also known in India as Jiva or leva, \nthe Creatress of all manifested forms. 1 In Assyrian scriptures she was \nentitled Mother- Womb, Creatress of Destiny, who made male and \nfemale human beings out of clay, "in pairs she completed them." 4 \nThe first of the Bible\'s two creation myths gives this Assyrian version, \nsignificantly changing "she" to "he" (Genesis 1:27). \n\nThe original Eve had no spouse except the serpent, a living \nphallus she created for her own sexual pleasure. 5 Some ancient \npeoples regarded the Goddess and her serpent as their first parents. 6 \nSacred icons showed the Goddess giving life to a man, while her \nserpent coiled around the apple tree behind her. 7 Deliberate misinter- \npretation of such icons produced ideas for revised creation myths like \nthe one in Genesis. Some Jewish traditions of the first century B.C., \nhowever, identified Jehovah with the serpent deity who accompanied \nthe Mother in her garden. 8 Sometimes she was Eve, sometimes her \nname was given as Nahemah, Naama, or Namrael, who gave birth to \nEve and Adam without the help of any male, even the serpent. 9 \n\nBecause Jehovah arrogantly pretended to be the sole Creator, Eve I \nwas obliged to punish him, according to Gnostic scriptures. Though \nthe Mother of All Living existed before everything, the God forgot she j \nhad made him and had given him some of her creative power. "He \nwas even ignorant of his own Mother. ... It was because he was foolish \nand ignorant of his Mother that he said, \'I am God; there is none \nbeside me.\'" Gnostic texts often show the creator reprimanded and \npunished for his arrogance by a feminine power greater and older \nthan himself. 10 \n\nThe secret of God\'s "Name of power," the Tetragrammaton, \nwas that three-quarters of it invoked not God, but Eve. YHWH, yod- \nhe-vau-he, came from the Hebrew root HWH, meaning both "life" \nand "woman" in Latin letters, E-V-E. 16 With the addition of an I \n\n\n\n288 \n\n\n\n(yod), it amounted to the Goddess\'s invocation of her own name as the \nWord of creation, a common idea in Egypt and other ancient lands. 17 \nGnostic scriptures said Adam was created by the power of Eve\'s \nword, not God\'s. She said, "Adam, live! Rise up upon the earth!" As \nsoon as she spoke the word, her word became reality. Adam rose up and \nopened his eyes. "When he saw her, he said, \'You will be called "the \nmother of the living," because you are the one who gave me life.\'" 18 \n\nAdam\'s name meant he was formed of clay moistened with blood, \nthe female magic oiadamah or "bloody clay." 19 He didn\'t produce \nthe Mother of All Living from his rib; in earlier Mesopotamian stories, \nhe was produced from hers. (See Birth-giving, Male.) His Babylo- \nnian predecessor Adapa (or Adamu) was deprived of eternal life not by \nthe Goddess, but by a hostile God. \n\nThe biblical idea was a reversal of older myths in which the \nGoddess brought forth a primal male ancestor, then made him her \nmate the ubiquitous, archetypal divine-incest relationship traceable in \nevery mythology. The reversal was not even original with biblical \nauthors. It was evolved by Aryan patriarchs who called Brahma the \nprimal male ancestor. They claimed their god brought forth the \nMother of All Living from his own body, then mated with her, so she \ngave birth to the rest of the universe. 20 In the Hebraic version, a \nwombless God made his offspring with his hands, and the actual birth- \ngiving was left to Adam. The Bible as revised by patriarchal scribes \nsaid nothing about a divine birth-giving, since the scribes were deter- \n\nined to separate the concepts of "deity" and "mother" insofar as \npossible. \n\nGnostic scriptures however reverted to the older tradition and \nsaid Eve not only created Adam and obtained his admission to heaven; \nshe was the very soul within him, as Shakti was the soul of every \nHindu god and yogi. Adam couldn\'t live without "power from the \nMother," so she descended to earth as "the Good Spirit, the \nThought of Light called by him \'Life\' (Hawwa)." She entered into \nAdam as his guiding spirit of conscience: "It is she who works at the \ncreature, exerts herself on him, sets him in his own perfect temple, \nnlightens him on the origin of his deficiency, and shows him his \n(way of) ascent." Through her, Adam was able to rise above the \ngnorance imposed on him by the male God. 21 \n\nBy this Gnostic route came the Midrashic assertion that Adam and \nSve were originally androgynous, like Shiva and his Shakti. She dwelt \nn him, and he in her; they were two souls united in one body, which \n3od later tore apart, depriving them of their bliss of union. Cabalists \nook up the idea and said the paradise of Eden can be regained only \nrvhen the two sexes are once more united; even God must be united \nvith his female counterpart, the heavenly Eve called Shekina. 22 \n\nAnother Gnostic version of the story made God a true villain, who \nursed Adam and Eve and expelled them from paradise out of \nealousy of their happiness. He also lusted after the Virgin Eve, raped \nler, and begot her sons Jahveh and Elohim, whose other names were \n\n\n\nEve \n\n\n\nEve was one of the \ncommon Middle- \nEastern names of the \nsuperior feminine \npower. To the \nHittites, she was \nHawwah, "Life." 11 \nTo the Persians, she \nwas Hvov, "the \nEarth." 12 Aramaeans \ncalled her Hawah, \n"Mother of All \nLiving." 13 In \nAnatolia she was Hebat \nor Hepat, with a \nGreek derivative Hebe, \n"Virgin Mother \nEarth," with the same \nrelationship to the \nGreat Goddess Hera as \nKore-Persephone to \nDemeter, and Hebe \nmay have been an \neponymous ancestress \nof "Hebrews." A \nSemitic root of her \nnames was hayy, a \nmatrilineal kinship \ngroup, once \nconsidered the "life" of \nevery tribe by direct \ndescent from the \nCreatress. H The \nnames of Eve, the \nSerpent, and "Life" \nare still derived from the \nsame root in \nArabic. 15 \n\n\n\n289 \n\n\n\nEve \n\n\n\nSt. John Chrysostom, \n\n"Golden-mouthed \nJohn," 4th-century \nChristian orator who \nserved as Patriarch of \nConstantinople until he \nincurred the wrath of \nthe empress Eudoxia, \nwho arranged to \nhave him deposed and \nexiled. \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens Ter- \ntullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Car- \nthage of pagan parents. \n\n\n\nCain and Abel. Here was one of several myths that made Eve the \nmother not only of Adam, but also of Jehovah, and of all the \nelements as well. The myth went on to say the first of Eve\'s offspring \nruled the male elements of fire and air; the second ruled the female \nelements of earth and water. 23 \n\nLike her prototype Kali Jaganmata, Eve brought forth death as \nwell as life that is, she brought forth all living forms, all of which \nwere subject to death for the very reason that they were alive. Under \npatriarchal systems of belief, the fact that every living thing is doomed \nto die was blamed on the Mother who gave it a finite life. Instead of \nblaming God for casting Adam out of the paradise where he might \nhave lived forever, the patriarchs blamed Eve for bringing this about. \nThe Wisdom of Jesus ben Sirach said evil began with Woman (Eve): \n"because of her we all die." 24 Fathers of the Christian church said Eve \nconceived by the serpent and brought forth Death. The seeds of all \nwomen already existed in Eve, St. John Chrysostom maintained, so that \nin her sin "the whole female race transgressed." 25 \n\nThe Book of Enoch said God created death to punish all humanity \nfor Eve\'s sin, but many patriarchal thinkers hesitated to blame God \neven indirectly. The prevalent opinion was that when Eve disobeyed \nthe deity, death somehow just happened. 26 St. Paul blamed only Eve, \nabsolving Adam from guilt for the apple-eating incident: "Adam was not \ndeceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression" (1 \nTimothy 2:14). A church council announced in 418 a.d. that it was \nheresy to say death was a natural necessity rather than the result of \nEve\'s disobedience. 27 \n\nThis was the real origin of the church fathers\' fear and hatred of \nwomen, which expanded into a sexist attitude that permeated all of \nwestern society: Woman was identified with Death. Her countervailing \nresponsibility for birth was taken away, and the creation of life was \nlaid to the credit of the Father-god, whose priests claimed he could \nremove the curse of death. As every woman was understood to be an \nemanation of Eve, Tertullian said to Everywoman: \n\nAnd do you not know that you are an Eve? The sentence of God on this \nsex of yours lives in this age; the guilt must of necessity live too. You \nare the devil\'s gateway . . . the first deserter of the divine law; you are she \nwho persuaded him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack. \nYou destroyed so easily God\'s image, man. On account of your desert | \nthat is, death, even the Son of God had to die. 28 \n\nMedieval theologians said Adam was forgiven. Christ descended \ninto hell and rescued Adam along with other biblical patriarchs. He \nescorted Adam into heaven, saying, "Peace be to thee and to all the \njust among thy sons." 29 But for Eve there was no forgiveness. No peace \nwas offered to her or her daughters. Presumably, they were left \nbehind in hell. Christian theologians espoused the same theory as \nPersian patriarchs, that heaven was closed to all women except those \nwho were submissive and worshipped their husbands as gods. 30 Even \n\n\n\n290 \n\n\n\nmodern theologians naively blame human death on the Edenic sin. \nRahner said, "Man\'s death is the demonstration of the fact that he has \nfallen away from God Death is guilt made visible." 51 Theolo- \ngians have not yet dealt with the question of what "guilt" causes death \namong non-human creatures. \n\nActually, churches depend for their very existence on the orthodox \nmyth of Eve. "Take the snake, the fruit-tree, and the woman from \nthe tableau, and we have no fall, no frowning Judge, no Inferno, no \neverlasting punishment hence no need of a Savior. Thus the \nbottom falls out of the whole Christian theology." 32 \n\nEqually destructive to Christian theology would be restoration of \nbooks arbitrarily excluded from the canon, such as the Apocalypse of \nAdam, in which Adam stated that he and Eve were created together but \nshe was his superior. She brought with her "a glory which she had \nseen in the aeon from which we had come forth. She taught me a word \nof knowledge. . . . And we resembled the great eternal angels, for we \nwere higher than the God who had created us."" \n\nSome of these once-sacred books made Eve superior to both Adam \nand the creator. It was she, not God, who gave Adam his soul and \nbrought him to life. It was she, not God, who cast down the evil deities \nfrom heaven and made them demons. And she, as the eternal female \nPower, would eventually judge the God she created, find him guilty of \ninjustice, and destroy him. 34 \n\nAs an allegory, this might reflect a social truth. Fragile constructs \nof the collective mind, gods are easily destroyed by those who ignore \nthem. Early Gnostic documents show that most women of the ancient \nworld were disposed to ignore the God who was said to have cursed \ntheir sex and their descendants forever. Had one of the other versions of \nthe Eve myth prevailed over the canonical version, sexual behavior \npatterns in western civilization almost certainly would have evolved \nalong very different lines. Christianity managed to project man\'s fear \nof death onto woman, not to respect her as Kali the Destroyer was \nrespected, but to hate her. \n\nThe uncanonical scriptures were no more and no less creditable \nthan the canonical ones. Their picture of Eve as God\'s stern mother, \nhe defender of mankind against a tyrannical demon-deity, had more \nadherents in the early Christian centuries than the picture that is now \namiliar. One of Christianity\'s best-kept secrets was that the Mother of \nMl Living was the Creatress who chastised God. \n\n1. Avalon, 120, 278. 2. Waddell, 126. 3. d\'Alviella, 153. 4.

At \nfirst he was \naccounted a saint, but \nthree centuries after \nhis death he was \ndeclared a heretic \nbecause of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\n\n\nEvolution \n\nThe theory of species development given to the world by Darwin and \nhis successors had no special religious significance, except that Christian \nauthorities viewed it as a contradiction of their all-important Eden \nmyth, just as Galileo\'s astronomical discoveries contradicted the Bible\'s \ngeocentric cosmos. The theory of evolution showed man could not \nhave "fallen"; there was no original sin and therefore no need of \nsalvation. \n\nIn 1869 a German theologian, Dr. Schund, said, "If Darwin be \nright in his view of the development of man out of a brutal condition, \nthen the Bible teaching in regard to man is utterly annihilated." The \nAmerican Episcopal Church said: "If this hypothesis be true, then is \nthe Bible an unbearable fiction . . . then have Christians for nearly two \nthousand years been duped by a monstrous lie. . . . Darwin requires \nus to disbelieve the authoritative word of the Creator." Another theo- \nlogical heavyweight declared: "If the Darwinian theory is true, \nGenesis is a lie, the whole framework of the book of life falls to pieces, \nand the revelation of God to man, as we Christians know it, is a \ndelusion and a snare." \' \n\nThese gentlemen were right. The theory of evolution does indeed \ncontradict the biblical creation myths and the dogma of the Fall. As \nthe evidence in favor of evolution continued to pile up, fundamentalist \nchurches desperately sought ways to ignore it, or else reconcile the \nirreconcilable. Pope Paul IV spoke on the subject of evolution in 1966: \n\nSuch explanations do not agree with the teaching of Sacred Scripture, \nSacred Tradition, and the Church \'s magisterium, according to which \nthe sin of the first man is transmitted to all his descendants not through \nimitation but through propagation. . . . The theory of evolution will not \nseem acceptable to you whenever it is not decisively in accord with the \nimmediate creation of each and every human soul by God, and \nwhenever it does not regard as decisively important for the fate of \nmankind the disobedience of Adam, the universal first parent. 2 \n\nSince the theory of evolution can never be "decisively in \naccord" with the orthodox view, it can never be accepted by the \n"infallible" church. The orthodox view has remained on the 17th- \ncentury level of Father Mersenne who "expressed the opinion of the \nmost enlightened theologians when he declared that orthodoxy did \nnot fear either science or reason, and was quite prepared to accept all \ntheir conclusions, \'provided they agreed with the Scriptures.\'" 3 \n\nSeventeen hundred years ago, Origen wrote of the Garden of \nEden myth: "No one would be so foolish as take this allegory as a \ndescription of actual fact." 4 But Origen was excommunicated, and \ncountless millions have been precisely that foolish. \n\n1.

Protestant churches don\'t \nexorcise. As far back as 1603 the Church of England forbade ministers \nto cast out devils, though a present-day Archbishop of Canterbury \npublicly confessed a belief in "genuine demonic possession" in 1974. 1 \nThe Roman church maintains the office of exorcist, whose rite of \nordination states: "An Exorcist must cast out devils." 2 The Official New \nCatholic Encyclopedia says, "Today the Church maintains its tradi- \ntional attitude toward exorcism. It recognizes the possibility of diabolical \npossession, and it regulates the manner of dealing with it. \n... A solemn method of exorcising is given in the Roman Ritual." 3 \n\nThis "solemn method" is based on name magic and words of \npower, like exorcisms used by Egyptian wizards thousands of years \nago. It says in part: "I command thee, whosoever thou art, thou unclean \nspirit, and all thy companions possessing this servant of God, that by \nthe Mysteries of the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension \nof our Lord Jesus Christ, by the sending of the Holy Ghost, and by \nthe Coming of the same our Lord to judgment, thou tell me thy name, \nthe day, and the hour of thy going out, by some sign; and, that to me, \na minister of God, although unworthy, thou be wholly obedient in all \nthings." Exorcistic power of chastity is invoked: "The continence of \nthe Confessors commands thee." Inanimate objects can be exorcised in \nthe same manner, as in the consecration of medals: "I exorcise ye, \nmedals, through God the Father Almighty. . . . May the power of the \nadversary, all the host of the Devil, all evil attack, every spirit and \nglamour of Satan, be utterly put to flight and driven far away by the \nvirtue of these medals." 4 \n\nThe history of exorcism often demonstrates legalistic-theological \nbuffoonery at its silliest, as in the many instances of insect pests and \nother vermin verbally assaulted by the exorcist, though paying no \ndiscernible attention to the anathemas that threatened them. In 1478 \nthe authorities of Berne addressed a plague of crop-eating insects, "I \ndeclare and affirm that you are banned and exorcised, and through \nthe power of Almighty God shall be called accursed and shall daily \ndecrease." The insects, however, only continued to increase. In 1516 \nthe Provost of Troyes commanded all caterpillars to "retire within six \ndays from the vineyards and lands of Villenose, threatening them \nwith his solemn curse and malediction if they failed to obey." The \ncaterpillars apparently weren\'t listening. From the 16th century \nonwards, it was a Savoyard custom to excommunicate destructive \ninsects, even though they seemed not to care about being banned \nfrom God\'s congregation. In 1633 the consuls of Strambino summoned \nthe caterpillars "to appear before the bench of reason to show cause \n\n\n\n293 \n\n\n\nEye \n\n\n\nwhy they should not desist from corroding and destroying, under \npenalty of banishment from the place and confiscation." In 1713 the \nFriars Minor in Piedade no Maranho, Brazil, claimed that their exor- \ncism of ants worked, and "by God\'s express order the ants departed to \nanother place." 5 \n\nIn a process against leeches, which was tried at Lausanne in 1451, a \nnumber of leeches were brought into court to hear the notice served \nagainst them, which admonished all leeches to leave the district within \nthree days. The leeches, however, proving contumacious and refusing to \nquit the country, they were solemnly exorcised. . . . The doctors of \nHeidelberg in particular, then a famous seat of learning, not only expressed \ntheir entire and unanimous approbation of the exorcism, but imposed \nsilence on all impertinent meddlers who presumed to speak against it. 6 \n\nWhen used against human beings, the process of exorcism \nproved rather more baneful than absurd, tending to exacerbate the very \nsymptoms it was supposed to relieve.

Moslem \nSyrians called her \nAina Bisha, the eye- \nwitch. \n\n\n\nEye \n\nThe All-Seeing Eye of ancient Egypt once belonged to the Goddess \nof truth and judgment, Maat. 1 The Mother-syllable Maa meant "to \nsee"; in hieroglyphics it was an eye. 2 \n\nA late text transferred the All-Seeing Eye to a male god, Horus, \nand the common symbol came to be known as the Eye of Horus, also \nrepresenting the phallus as the "One-Eyed God." Yet the same Eye \nwas incongruously described as a female judge: "I am the all-seeing \nEye of Horus, whose appearance strikes terror, Lady of Slaughter, \nMighty One." 3 The Eye whose appearance strikes terror was the \noriginal prototype of the evil eye which, like the petrifying glance of \nMedusa, was usually associated with women and was feared by \nsimple folk everywhere, up to the present day. \n\nStaring idols of the Neolithic "Eye Goddess" have been found \nthroughout Mesopotamia. In Syria she was known as the Goddess \nMari, whose huge eyes searched men\'s souls. 4 \n\nLike Moslems, Christians diabolized the female spirit of the All- \nSeeing Eye. Old women were credited with the ancient Goddess\'s \npower to "overlook" to curse someone with a glance. Judges of the \nInquisition so greatly feared the evil eyes of their victims that they \nforced accused witches to enter the court backward, to deprive them of \nthe advantage of a first glance. 6 \n\n\n\n294 \n\n\n\nOddly enough, remedies for the evil eye were often female Eye \n\nsymbols. Necklaces of cowrie shells, those ubiquitous yonic symbols, \n\nwere and are valued in India as charms against the evil eye. The triangle ^^^^^^^^^^_ \nor Yoni Yantra, representing the vulva, is similarly used in India, \nGreece, and the Balkans. Northern Indian farmers protect crops from \nthe evil eye by hanging Kali\'s symbol of a black pot in the field. In \n18th-century England, the classic witch\'s familiar, a black cat, was \nsupposed to afford protection; and sore eyes could be cured by \nrubbing with a black cat\'s tail. 7 In addition there were many signs, \ngestures, and other kinds of counter-spells to be used as instant \nremedies if one suspected having been "overlooked." \n\nIt seems men were very much averse to meeting a direct glance \nfrom a woman. In the most patriarchal societies, from medieval Japan \nto Europe, it was customary to insist that "proper" women keep their \neyelids lowered in the presence of men. In 19th-century Islamic Iran, \nit was believed that every woman above the age of menopause possessed \nthe evil eye. Old women were not permitted in crowds attending \npublic appearances of the Shah, lest his sacred person be exposed to an \nold woman\'s dangerous look. 8 \n\nAny person invested with spiritual powers, however, could be \n\ncredited with the power to curse with a look. Several popes were \n\nreputed to be bearers of the evil eye ox jettatura. Pope Pius IX (d. 1878) \n\nwas a famous jettatore. Pope Leo XIII, his successor, was said to have \n\nthe evil eye because so many cardinals died during his reign. 9 \n\nI. Budge, G.E. 1, 392. 2. Budge, E.L., 55. 3. Cavendish, RE., 167. \n4.

Sometimes \nit was the "never- \nnever" land, perhaps \nafter an Egyptian \nword for paradise, \nnefemefer, "doubly \nbeautiful." The Faroe \nIslands were once \n"fairyland" (medieval \nNorse Faeroisland) \nbecause the original \nexplorers reached \nthem by sailing west \nand believed them to \nbe the islands of the \ndead. 8 \n\n\n\nFairies \n\nPagan gods and goddesses, tribal ancestors, and those who wor- \nshipped them all became "fairies" in the traditions of France, Germany, \nand the British Isles. The Irish still say fairies live in the pagan sidh \n(burial mounds and barrow graves), several hundred of which still stand \nin the Irish countryside. 1 The Welsh knew their ancestors had a \nmatriarchal society. Like the Irish, they called fairies The Mothers, or \nThe Mother\'s Blessing; and fairyland was always the Land of \nWomen. 2 \n\nFairies came out of their fairy hills at Halloween, Celtic folk said, \nbecause the hills themselves were tomb-wombs of rebirth according \nto the ancient belief, and Halloween was only a new name for Samhain, \nwhen the dead returned to earth with the help of the priestesses \nwho, under Christianity, were newly described as witches. 3 Respect for \nthe pagan dead endured to a remarkably late date, even among \nChristians whose church taught them that the old deities were devils. \nCornish miners refused to make the sign of the cross when down in a \nmine, for fear of offending the fairies in their own subterranean territory \nby making a gesture that invoked their enemy. 4 \n\nIn the Book of the Dun Cow, the fairy queen described her realm \nas "the land of the ever-living, a place where there is neither death, \nnor sin, nor transgression. We have continual feasts: we practice every \nbenevolent work without contention. We dwell in a large Shee \n(sidh); and hence we are called the people of the Fairy-Mound." 5 \n\nThe pagan after-world was a golden "dream time" of long ago, \nwhen heroes were deified by sacred marriage with the Goddess. The \nGreat God Lug, father of Ireland\'s dying savior Cu Chulainn, came \n"out of the chambered undergrounds of Tara where dwell the fourth \nrace of gods who settled Ireland. They are the glorious and golden \ngiants, Tuatha De Danann. These people of the goddess Dana first \nused gold and silver in an Age of Bronze. They first cleared the land, \nfirst drained the swamps. They built the great temples of stone like \nthe one they sent to Britain Stonehenge. When conquered, they \nretired to their underground barrows or Sidhe where they still live \ntoday." 6 \n\nFairy mounds were entrances to the pagan paradise, which might \nbe located underground, or under water, or under hills on distant \nislands across the western sea where the sun died. \n\nThe fairy queen was obviously the ancient fertility-mother, like \nDemeter or Ceres. William of Auvergne said in the 1 3th century she \nwas called Abundia, or Dame Abonde: "Abundance." 9 She was also \ncalled Diana, Venus, Hecate, Sybil, or Titania a title of Cretan \nRhea as ruler of the earth-spirits called Titans, predecessors of the \nOlympian gods. (See Titania.) She had all three personae of the \nTriple Goddess, including the death-dealing Crone which is why an \nIrish title Bean-Sidhe, "Woman of the Fairy-Mounds," was corrupt- \ned into banshee, the shrieking demoness whose voice brought death. In \n\n\n\n298 \n\n\n\nthe form of the triple Morrigan, she sang of blood sacrifices related to \nspringtime renewal of vegetation. 10 A variation on her title was the \nnotorious Morgan le Fay or Morgan the Fairy, also known as the \ndeath-goddess, "Morgue la faye." n \n\nThe Romance of Lancelot du Lac spoke of the fairy queen in \nanother incarnation as Lady of the Lake: "The damsel who carried \nLancelot to the lake was a fay, and in those times all those women were \ncalled fays who had to do with enchantments and charms and there \nwere many of them then, principally in Great Britain and knew the \npower and virtues of words, of stones, and of herbs." Their knights \nwere forbidden to speak their names, for fear of betraying them to \nChristian persecutors. 12 \n\nSecrecy attended many aspects of the fairy-religion, for the very \nreason that it was carried on clandestinely under a dominant religious \nsystem that threatened its practitioners with torture and death. One of \nthe charges that sent Joan of Arc to the stake was that she "adored the \nFairies and did them reverence." n \n\nA legend repeated by the gypsies said if a man found the statue of a \nnaked fate (fairy) in the ruins of pagan temples or tombs, he should \nembrace it with love and eject semen on it. Then, like Pygmalion\'s \nGalatea, the fate would come to life in his dreams and tell her lover \nwhere to find buried treasure, and she would become his "fortune." He \nwould be happy with her forevermore, provided he agreed never to \nset foot in a Christian church again as long as he lived. 14 \n\nThis idea of the fairy-fortune might be traced all the way back to \nancient customs of matrilineal inheritance and matrilocal marriage, \ncharacteristic both of Bronze Age myths and of fairy tales. The fairy-tale \nhero rarely brought a bride to his own home; instead, he left home to \nseek his "fortune," which usually turned out to be a foreign princess \nwon by trial and wedded in her own country, which the hero \nafterward helped rule. As in the pre-patriarchal system, a woman was \n:he "fortune" or "fate" of the young man, words which also meant \n\'fairy," through such intermediates as Fata, Fay, Le Fee, or the "fey" \n:>ne. Fairy and Fate were further related through fear and fair: \nnedieval Latin fatare, "to enchant," became French faerox feer. 15 \n\nMany believed fairies lived in the deep woods where their sacred \njroves had been hidden from priestly interference. Romanians still \n.peak of the Fata Padourii, Girl of the Woods, a fairy similar to the Irish \n)anshee. At night she makes eerie sounds that portend death to the \n| learer. 16 In Brittany, where there were many groves dedicated to the \nVIoon-goddess throughout the middle ages, fairies were sometimes \ncalled man-devent, "Moon-goddesses." 17 \n\nIt seems the fairy-religion was practiced secretly through most of \nhe Christian era, especially by women, whose Goddess the patriar- \nchal church kept trying to take away, giving them no substitute but \nMary, who lacked the old Goddess\'s powers. \n\nCertain French leaders of the Old Religion were described as \n\n\n\nFairies \n\n\n\nBook of the Dun \nCow (Lebar-na-Heera), \nso called because the \noriginal manuscript was \nwritten on vellum \nmade from the skin of a \nprized cow: a \ncollection of 11th- \ncentury Irish tales \nand poems, compiled by \nMailmuri Mac \nKelleher. \n\n\n\n299 \n\n\n\nFairies \n\n\n\nTasso\'s list of Fairy- \nladies showed them \nindistinguishable \nfrom either Goddesses \nor witches, for they \nhad names of both, \nincluding the titles of \nFata, Maga, \nIncantatrice, or wise- \nwoman. They were \nOriana, She of the \nMountain; Silvana or \nSilvanella, She of the \nWood; Filidea, She \nWho Loves the \nGoddess; Mirinda, the \nWarrior Woman; \nArgea, called Queen of \nFate; Lucina, called \nthe Lady of the Lake; \nUrganda, called the \nWise One; two Fates or \nFays named \nDragontina and \nMontana, and \nMorgana with her three \n"daughters," the \nMorrigan. 21 \n\n\n\nTorquato Tasso \n\n(1554-1595) Italian poet \nand dramatist, whose \ncheckered career \nincluded periods of \nresidence in courts, \nconvents, and \nprisons. His major work \nwas an epic on the \nconquest of Jerusalem. \n\n\n\nAucassin and \nNicolette French \nmedieval romance \nbased on an Arabian \nlove story. Aucassin \'s \noriginal name was Al- \nKasim. \n\n\n\n"great princesses who, having refused to embrace Christianity . . . \nwere struck by the curse of God. Hence it is that they are said to be ani- \nmated by a violent hatred of [Christian] religion and of the clergy." \nSometimes they were called Korrigen, Korrig, or Korr, perhaps devotees \nof the Virgin Kore. A Breton lay said: "There are nine Korrigen, \nwho dance, with flowers in their hair, and robes of white wool, around \nthe fountain, by the light of the full moon." They seem to have been \nold women who used masks or makeup: "Seen at night, or in the dusk \nof the evening, their beauty is great; but in the daylight their eyes \nappear red, their hair white, and their faces wrinkled; hence they rarely \nlet themselves be seen by day." 18 \n\nAs late as the 17th century it was said there were shrines kept by "a \nthousand old women" who taught the rites of Venus to young \nmaidens, and instructed them in fairy feats like shape-shifting and raising \nstorms. 19 They were known as fatuae or fatidicae, "seeresses," or \nsometimes bonnes HUes, "good girls." 20 \n\nNorwegian, Scottish, and Irish Christians claimed the fairies were \noffspring of the fallen angels. Like the non-fallen angels, they carried \noff souls of the dead. Any who happened to die at twilight, the fairies\' \nhour between day and night, would find themselves in fairyland \nbetween life and death, or between heaven and hell. 22 Such legends \nreflect ancient views of the after-world as without either punishment \nor reward but only a way-station in the karmic cycle, which is why fairies \nwere like the un-dead able to emerge from their tombs at will. As \npsychopomps, they were the same as Valkyries or Hindu apsaras, the \nheavenly nymphs who became penis, "fairies," in Middle-Eastern \ncountries where the Old Religion was also maintained as a sub-current \nin patriarchal culture. \n\nCertainly one of the strongest attractions of the fairy-religion was \nits permissive view of sexuality, typical of ancient matriarchal societ- \nies, living on in contrast to the harsh anti-sexual attitudes of orthodoxy. \nFairyland was the heaven of sexy angels, as opposed to the Christian \nheaven where "bliss" was specifically not sexual, not even in matrimony \n(Matthew 22:30). The fairyland called Torelore in the romance of \nAucassin and Nicolette was a home for lovers, as opposed to the \nChristian heaven of "old priests, and halt old men and maimed." The \nfairy king lay in bed pretending to give birth to a child, in the ancient rite \nof couvade (see Fatherhood); the queen led an army against their \nenemies in a bloodless battle, the combatants pelting each other with \nsymbolic foods such as apples, eggs, and cheeses. The king said, "it is \nnowise our custom to slay each other." 23 (See Paradise.) \n\nToward this paradise the Fairy Queen led her lovers on a "broad, \nbroad road across the lily lea," as Thomas Rhymer\'s ballad said, \nwhich some called the road to heaven, and others the road to hell: a \nprototype of the famous Primrose Path. The Queen herself was \naddressed as Queen of Heaven. 24 Sometimes her earthly angels were \nmore spirit than mortal, like the fairies called Little Wood Women \n\n\n\n300 \n\n\n\n\\{wudu-maer) in Bavaria, to whom dumplings and other foodstuffs were \noffered. 25 Yet most sources admitted that the fairies were real live \n[women. Prior wrote, "In Danish ballads fairies are full grown women \niand not the diminutive beings of our English tales." Said Andrew \nLang, "There seems little in the characteristics of these fairies of \njromance to distinguish them from human beings, except their super- \nnatural knowledge and power. They are . . . usually of ordinary stature, \niindeed not to be recognized as varying from mankind except by their \n[proceedings." 26 In other words, they were women practicing heathen \njrites. \n\n1.

Letting their imaginations soar, martyrologists \naved over her famous physical beauty. 5 Perhaps because of this, she \ncame a popular patroness of romance.

The \nfemale trinity assumed many different guises in western religion: the \nNorns or Weird Sisters of the north (from wyrdf "fate"), the Zorya of \nthe Slavs, the Morrigan of the Irish, the triple Guinevere or triple Brigi \nof the Britons. \n\nIn Greek myth the three Fates were Horae, Graeae, Muses, \nGorgons, Furies, and other trinities as well as the principal trinity of \nMoerae or Fates. Nearly always, they were weavers. In Anglo-Saxon \nliterature, fate is "woven." Latin destino (destiny) means that which \nis woven, or fixed with cords and threads; fate is "bound" to happen, \njust as the spells of fairy-women were "binding." \' \n\nThe Moerae were Clotho the Spinner, Lachesis the Measurer, \nand Atropos the Cutter of life\'s thread. All were aspects of the archaic \nTriple Aphrodite, of whom it was said her real name was Moera, and \nshe was older than Time. 2 Moera was actually a late name for the \nFate-goddess. In the Mycenaean period it meant a landholding, pos- \nsessed by a female property owner according to the old matriarchal \nsystem. Hence, Moera was a lot: later, "allotted Fate." 3 \n\nAphrodite\'s trinity was sometimes divided into three Horae, or \ncelestial nymphs: Eunomia, Dike, and Irene, meaning Order, Desti- \nny, and Peace. These referred to the "ordering" of elements to form tr \nindividual; the destiny established for him by the Mother; and the \n"peace" of dissolution as decreed at the end of life by Aphrodite \nColumba, the Dove of Peace. 4 \n\nIf the weaving Fates could be induced not to cut the thread of life \nat a perilous moment, the individual would be spared; if not, he \nwould die. Magic charms were often based on this notion. A Slavic \ncharm for healing wounds was addressed to the Fate-weaver on the \nmystic isle of Bujan, or Buyan, the Goddess\'s paradise: "In the Ocean- \nsea, on the isle of Buyan, a fair maiden was weaving silk; she did not \nleave off weaving silk; the blood ceased flowing." 5 According to RussU \nmyth, this maiden was the Virgin of Dawn, equivalent to the Latin \nMater Matuta, or the Greek Eos, traditionally the first Fate. The sun \ngod went to rest on her magic isle, and rose again from it each day. 6 \n\nOther Greek names for the Fate-goddess were Tyche, Dike, and \n\n\n\n302 \n\n\n\nNemesis. Romans called her Fortuna; a trinity or a monad. A \nterracotta medallion from Vienne showed her as a tutelary city-goddess, \nwearing a mural crown, enthroned in a laurel wreath. 7 As the \nBabylonian "Mother of Destiny," Fate was named Mammetun, the \nCreatress. 8 All were based on the primordial Indo-European Mother \nof Karma, i.e., Kali Ma. \n\n"Fate" was synonymous with "fairy" in the Middle Ages. Alphon- \nsus de Spina placed "Fates" first on his list of devils, remarking: \n"Some say they have seen Fates, but if so they are not women but \ndemons." 9 Burchardus of Worms complained that the people hon- \nored the Fates or Weird Sisters at the beginning of every year, putting \nofferings of food and drink on a table for them, with three knives for \ncutting their meat presumably so the death-dealing Cutter wouldn\'t \nbe tempted to use her own knife. 10 \n\nGreeks still say the Fates visit the cradle of every newborn, to \ndetermine the child\'s future as his fairy godmothers. Parents used to \nchain up the watchdog, leave the door open, and set out dainty foods to \nput the Moerae in a good humor. 11 Many fairy tales give stern lessons \nin the folly of offending fairy godmothers. Gypsies still say "three ladies \nin white" stand at the cradle of each child, and take back the soul \nwhen life has run its course, like the Three Queens of Arthurian legend. \nGreek laments for the dead are still called moirologhia, giving the \ndeceased back to the Moerae. 12 \n\nI.

Ancestral mothers had been deified by their descen- \ndants for countless generations. Patriarchs craved similar nations of \ndescendants, for a tribal ancestor achieved great glory in the after- \nworld. Men transferred their allegiance from the Great Mother, the \noriginal deified ancestress, to gods like Yahweh, on the basis of his \npromises: "I will make of these a great nation, and I will bless thee, and \n\nmake thy name great I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I \n\nwill make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee" (Genesis \n12, 17). \n\nPersians said a man who died childless couldn\'t enter paradise at \nall. Prayers and sacrifices of descendants were essential to blessedness \nfor the paternal soul. Hindus defined a son as one whose incantations \nand offerings kept a father\'s spirit from wandering homeless and \nhungry in the waste spaces of eternity. The Brhaddarma Purana said, \n"No rituals are performed for the man who has no descendants \n\n\n\nPuranas are ancient \nSanskrit scriptures in \nverse, treating of cos- \nmologies, sacred \nhistories, and the na- \nture of the divine. \n\n\n\n303 \n\n\n\nFatherhood Sons are useful to give oblations to the ancestors." \' The Chinese \n\nthought if a man had no son, he cut the continuous line of paternal \n\n^ h^mm ancestor-worship and lost his chance of becoming immortal. 2 \n\nFatherhood was largely a ceremonial relationship, with little recog- \nnition that men might take an active part in raising their own \nchildren. The classical Latin term paterfamilias, now connoting a father- \nof-a-family and household ruler, didn\'t convey anything like that to \nthe Romans who invented the term: \n\nWhen the ancients invoked Jupiter under that title of pater of gods and \nmen, they did not mean that he was their physical father, for they never \nsupposed he was, but on the contrary believed that the human race had \nexisted before he did. The same title was given to Neptune, Apollo, \nBacchus, Vulcan and Pluto, whom men certainly did not suppose to be \ntheir fathers. . . . Similarly, in legal language, the title o/paterfamilias \ncould be given to a man who had no children, was not married, was not \neven old enough to enter upon a marriage . . . ; pater, the Latin word \ncognate to "father" and closest akin to it in meaning, signifies not so much \nhim who has begotten a younger person as him who has natural \nauthority over one inferior in age or status. J \n\nMen or gods began to claim physical fatherhood not so much by \nan act of begetting, as by a different, ceremonial act designed to imitate \nthe motherly act of birth-giving. (See Birth-giving, Male.) In earliest \ntimes the imitation was quite literal, like the rite of couvade practiced by \nprimitives to establish paternal rights to a child. While the mother \ngave birth, the father took to his bed moaning and groaning, and \npretended to bring forth the child. Couvade was an initiation ritual \nfor priests of Aphrodite Ariadne at Amathus, where a man dressed in \nfemale clothing went through a pantomime of childbirth, to earn the \npriestly title of "father." 4 \n\nChristian writers said their religion was sent to convert Europe to a \npatriarchal system in which men could demand respect from their \noffspring. Before Christianity came to Britain, there was a "great sin" in \nthe structure of the clans: "the father loved not the son, nor the son \nloved not the father." 5 Early missionaries complained that British tribes \npaid no attention to the matter of who begot whom; women took \nlovers as they pleased, and "marital vows are never observed." St. Boni- \nface said the English "utterly despise legitimate matrimony," mean- \ning the kind of matrimony that gave husbands control of property and \nchildren. 6 \n\nEventually, Christianity changed the pagans\' casual attitude \ntoward fatherhood. St. Thomas Aquinas laid down the church\'s \nofficial opinion that a father is the true parent, a mother only the "soil" \nin which the father\'s "seed" grows. He said a father should be more \nloved than a mother, because the father\'s part in giving life to the child \nis "active," whereas the mother\'s part is only "passive." 7 \n\nEmphasis on paternity was characteristic of patriarchal societies, \nwhere men often tried to pretend that begetting a child was more \n\n\n\n304 \n\n\n\nimportant than the mother\'s multi-faceted task of carrying, delivering, \nnursing, and teaching it all the basic skills of living. In matriarchal \nArabia, biological paternity meant nothing. After the coming of Islam, \nmen considered paternity so important that they instituted a year\'s \nwaiting period between a woman\'s divorce or widowhood and her \nremarriage, to make absolutely sure she was not pregnant by the \nprevious husband, since no man wanted his wife giving birth to another \nman\'s child. 8 The same waiting period was demanded in Christian \nEurope, and became so taken for granted that it became "indecent" for \na woman to remarry too soon after an earlier husband\'s departure or \ndeath. \n\nOne reason for the restrictive, authoritarian atmosphere of patriar- \nchal societies seems to have been that men didn\'t readily see their \nchildren as separate persons, but viewed them as extensions of the \nfather\'s own ego, therefore requiring strict discipline to make them \nconform to the pattern. Zimmer says in the language of symbols, son \nmeans "double," "alter ego," "living copy of the father," "the \nfather\'s essence in another individualization." 9 Thus the father\'s inter- \nest in children was more selfish than the mother\'s. \n\nHarriet Stanton Blatch wrote, "Men talk of the sacredness of \nmotherhood, but judging from their acts it is the last thing that is held \nsacred. . . . The sense of obligation to offspring, men possess but feebly; \nthere has not been developed by animal evolution an instinct of \npaternity. They are not disinherited fathers; they are simply unevolved \nparents. Those who could improve humanity have been hindered by \nthose who prefer to improve steam engines. . . . The sex which has been \nlaboriously evolved by nature for the arduous work of race-building is \nhandicapped." Western patriarchy developed a culture of acquisitive- \nness, aggression, and hierarchy for the very reason that its underlying \nphilosophy was masculine-selfish, according to Neumann: "This situa- \ntion of the patriarchate known to us particularly from its Western \n[development is characterized by a recession of feminine psychology \nand its dominants; now feminine existence is almost entirely deter- \nI mined by the masculine world of consciousness and its values." 10 \n\nThe masculine world of consciousness has been characterized as \n"barren" and "destructive," insofar as "the fantasies of the single man \npervade our popular culture." n These focus on self-centered greed, \naggression, or defensiveness on behalf of the self, with little compre- \nhension of love, dependence, or responsibility toward future \ngenerations. Behavior patterns of the masculine world remind one \nthat the earliest Chinese ideograph for "male" was also a synonym for \n"selfish." 12 \n\nThis culture passes harsh judgment on women who are labeled \nunfit mothers, because males however "dominant" identify with the \nchild, not the mother. Standards for fathers are not so high. Drunkards, \nadulterers, child-beaters, even criminals are supposed to have a \n"right" to fatherhood, to say nothing of millions of men who treat their \n\n\n\nFatherhood \n\n\n\nHarriet Stanton \nBlatch 20th-century \nAmerican feminist, \ndaughter of Elizabeth \nCady Stanton. \n\n\n\n305 \n\n\n\nFatima children with a neglectful indifference that would bring down soci- \n\nFebronia, Saint e ty\'s wrath on a female parent.

The story probably was intended to express hostility to a \nveil-known Goddess-symbol. The fig was always female, its heart- \nshaped leaves representing "the conventional form of the yoni." 1 \n\n\n\n307 \n\n\n\nFig \n\n\n\nZekerboni \n\nA treatise on \noneiromancy (dream \ninterpretation) by \nPierre Mora, \nmanuscript #2790 in \nthe Bibliotheque de \nl\'Arsenal. \n\n\n\nRomans used to celebrate "a rude and curious rite" in connection with \nthe fertilization of Juno Caprotina, Goddess of the Fig Tree, by her \nlecherous horned goat god. 2 \n\nJesus\'s rival deity Mithra, whom some called the true Messiah, \nalso was involved with the maternal fig tree. Shortly after his birth \nfrom the petra genetrix, and his discovery by adoring shepherds, Mithra \nwas adopted by the fig tree, which provided him with a continuous \nsupply of food (fruit) and clothing (leaves). 3 According to the Book of \nGenesis, fig leaves were the world\'s first clothing, donned by Adam \nand Eve as soon as they acquired knowledge. Adoption by a fig tree also \nfigured prominently in the legend of Buddha, protected by the Bodhi \nTree, or Tree of Wisdom, Ecus religiosa, the Holy Fig, when he \nreceived his enlightenment on Full Moon Day in the month of \nMay. 4 \n\nThe fig was a common Indo-Iranian symbol of the Great Mother. \nBabylonian Ishtar also took the form of the divine fig tree Xikum, the \n"primeval mother at the central place of the earth," protectress of the \nsavior Tammuz. 5 Patriachal writers of the Koran later turned Ishtar\'s \ntree to Zakkum, the Tree of Hell, growing downward from the earth\'s \nunderside. 6 \n\nGaulish gods called Dusii were described in medieval Latin as \nficarii, "fig-eaters," which meant the same as the Homeric "lotus- \neaters," in view of the fact that both the fig and the lotus symbolized \nfemale genitals. 7 Anglo-Saxon "fuck" may have been derived from \nReus, "fig." To this day, Italians make the mano in fica, "fig-hand," as a \nderogatory sexual sign implying, like the raised middle finger, "fuck \nyou." The mano in fica was of Oriental origin, a lingam-yoni formed by \nthe thumb projecting between two fingers. Hindus called the fig- \nhand a sacred mudra, and Ovid said Roman householders used it as a \nprotection against evil spells. 8 To Christians however, it was manus \nobscenus, "the obscene hand." 9 \n\nLike other genital symbols, the fig was often incorporated into love \ncharms together with many other items formerly sacred to Venus. \nSome of these items blood, bread, doves, and pentacles joined the \nfig in a charm from the Zekerboni, to make bachelors see their future \nbrides in a dream: \n\nThey must have powdered coral and some fine powdered lodestone, \nwhich they shall mix together and dilute with the blood of a white \npigeon, and they shall make a dough of it, which they shall enclose in a \nlarge fig after having wrapped it in blue taffeta; they shall hang this \nround their neck, and when they go to bed shall put the pentacle for \nSaturday under their bolster, saying a special prayer the while. w \n\n\n\n1.

Middle finger, index finger, and \nthumb invoked pagan trinities of Father-Mother-Son, such as Jupiter- \n[uno-Mars, or Osiris-Isis-Horus. The same kind of trinity, consisting \njf God, Mary, and Jesus, used to be worshipped by eastern Christians \nwhich may explain why Christianity adopted the mano pantea and \nrenamed it "the hand of blessing." 3 The gesture was displayed by \n\nhristian priests and by emperors or kings by way of benediction and \nexpression of their own union with the land. 4 \n\nThe thumb was the child, or child-soul symbolized in such fables \nis Hop-O-My-Thumb. The index finger was the Mother, the one \nwho pointed, controlled, cast spells. The middle finger was the Father, a \nphallic symbol for thousands of years, up to and including the present \nday. \n\nArabs used to cut open a vein of the middle finger with a stone \ncnife when making a pledge of faith, invoking a curse of castration if \n:he pledge be broken. 5 Roman male prostitutes used to signal potential \n:ustomers by thrusting the middle finger into the hair of their heads. 6 \nLike all widely recognized phallic symbols, the middle finger was \nassociated with the devil by Christian authorities, who referred to it as \ndigitus infamis, "the vile finger." When the torturers asked accused \nbitches which finger they raised to take the devil\'s oath, the only \n\'right" answer they would accept was the middle finger. 7 It was \n:onsidered evil to wear a ring on the middle finger, for reasons plainly \nassociated with its sexual meanings. 8 \n\nOddly enough, the classic finger-sign of the devil didn\'t use the \nniddle finger at all, but displayed his "horned head" by pinning \ndown the middle and fourth fingers with the thumb and extending the \nndex and little fingers. On the well-known magic principle that an \nsvil sign was prophylactic against evil, this gesture was often used in \nItaly and the Balkans as a defense against the evil eye. Like most \nEuropean symbols, it seems to have originated with Kali Ma, who \njhowed it as a mudra (sacred gesture) in her manifestation as \n[agadamba, "Mother of the World." 9 Probably it was meant to signify \ntier own horned head embodied in the sacred cow. \n\nThe most revered mudra was the one meaning "infinity" or \n\'perfection," and most generally associated with female genitalia: \nthumb and forefinger pressed together at the tips, the other three fingers \n\n\n\n309 \n\n\n\nFirmament extended our modern OK sign. 10 Tantric yogis and bodhisattvas \n\nmade this gesture in token of contemplative ecstasy. 11 Persian sacred \n\n^^^^^^^ amulets of the Sassanian period (3rd century B.C.) showed a hand in \n\nthis position, flanked by horns of fertility. 12 The joined thumb and index \nfinger formed a vesica piscis, immemorial symbol of the yoni, while \nthe three extended fingers perhaps referred to the Goddess\'s trinity. \nWestern Europe inherited the Egyptian idea that the index and \nmiddle fingers stood for the mother and father, respectively. Egyptian \nmummies were buried with a protective amulet invoking both parents, \ncalled the Amulet of the Two Fingers. 15 The index or "mother" \nfinger was the most magical. This was the finger that guided, showed, \nbeckoned, called for attention, blessed, and cursed. \n\nMedieval Christians feared the pointing of a witch\'s index finger, \nwhich is why children are still taught that it\'s rude to point, and why a \nwoman\'s characteristic scolding gesture brandishes the index finger like \na weapon. In Tantric tradition, this mother-finger was known as "the \nthreatening finger." 14 All Indo-European traditions knew it was female. \nArabs said the index finger represents the Goddess Fatima, whose \nsymbolic Hand is still revered as a mystic summary of "the whole \nreligion of Islam." 15 \n\nJewish patriarchs insisted on fettering a woman\'s threatening, spell- \ncasting right index finger with the wedding ring, and orthodox Jewish \nwomen wear a wedding ring on that finger to this day. Christians, \nhowever, copied their wedding-ring custom from the pagans, who \nsaid a mystic "love vein" ran directly from the fourth finger of the left \nhand to the heart, therefore this finger should be bound in marriage. \nMacrobius wrote that a woman\'s wedding ring should be placed on that \nfinger "to prevent the sentiments of the heart from escaping." 16 \n\nThere was a universal prejudice against cutting fingernails without \ncareful disposal, lest fingernail pairings be used in malignant spells \nagainst their former owner. Norse myth said the doomsday ship Naglfar \nwas made of dead men\'s fingernails, so "if a man dies with his nails \nunshorn he is adding greatly to the materials for Naglfar" and bringing \ndoomsday that much closer. 17 Hence the custom of manicuring \ncorpses. \n\n1.

Branston, 278. \n\n\n\nFirmament \n\nThe Hebrew word for firmament meant "a sheet of hammered \nmetal." Sometimes this was called "the heaven of brass." The Bible \ngives the ancient notion that the heaven was the bottom of a vast \n\n\n\n310 \n\n\n\npistern, holding "the waters which were above the firmament" (Gene- Firstborn \n\nis 1:7) i.e., rain. \n\nAccording to this primitive notion, the rain fell down when angels ^^m^^m^mi^^ \nppened the "windows of heaven" to let some of the water out of the \nenormous cistern. Canaanite and early Jewish temples had magic \nb/indows in the roof, supposed to be models of the celestial windows, \nince everything about a temple was meant to copy the cosmos, not only \nymbolically but literally. When rain was needed, the magic windows \nivere opened, and this was believed to cause a corresponding action in \nhe celestial region. 2 This is why the Bible says God sent Noah\'s \nflood by opening all the windows of heaven at once (Genesis 7:1 1). \n\nThe biblical firmament of brass was based on an ancient Oriental \nmage of the house of Varuna, located in the zenith. It was a "house \nbf many mansions," corresponding to Jesus\'s description of his father\'s \nheaven (John 14:2). It had a thousand doors through which the light \nbf the celestial regions could shine, forming the stars. 5 These were \niransmuted by biblical writers into the windows of heaven. \n\n1. Gaster, 6. 2. Larousse, 79. 3. Campbell, Or.M., 177. \n\n\n\nFirstborn \n\nliost Asiatic gods claimed the title of Firstborn of the Womb, in \nanskrit Hiranyagarbha. Each priesthood wanted its own god to be \nfirstborn" of the Creatress, because her eldest child would wield \natural authority over the others. Since it was impossible for more than \nne god to be the Firstborn, scholars simply used the title and \nllaimed each god was the firstborn of one of the Great Mother\'s virgin \nmanations. \n\nThe classic example was the Buddha, born in many incarnations, \nach time as a "firstborn" of the Goddess\'s earthly representative, a \npmple maiden or devadasi, "Virgin Bride of God," bearing the name \nand spirit) of Maya, the virgin aspect of Mother Kali. As in all myths \nf divine births, the maiden might have an earthly husband, but he \nkln\'t lie with her until after she brought forth her firstborn child, \n|ho was the son of God, or, in Buddha\'s case, the son of Ganesha, the \nLord of Hosts. 1 \n\nThe actual mechanism of these divine impregnations was quite \nleral. The virgin mother-to-be deflowered herself by straddling the \nicred lingam the god\'s erect penis and allowing it to penetrate her. 2 \ni /hile thus conceiving the god\'s son, the virgin placed a wreath of \nowers on the head of his image, a symbolic act reminiscent of the \nticient Indian svayamara ceremony. 3 The wreath was her own \npnital symbol; the god\'s "head" was his. The god\'s head and the head \nThis lingam were both anointed with holy oil for the sacred \nliarriage, certainly a logical necessity for inserting a stone shaft into a \nagina. The custom and the temple phalli were standard \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n\n311 \n\n\n\nFirstborn throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean world, where the \n\nholy oil was known as chrism, and the priapic god was therefore a \n,^ ^^ m wm Christos or "Anointed One." \n\nIn the Middle East, Maya became Maia, Mari, or Mary, another \n"virgin bride of God" who served as a temple maiden or kadesha, the \nequivalent of the Hindu devadasi. According to the classic Indo- \nEuropean pattern, the angel of the Lord "came in unto" Mary (Luke \n1:28), which was the biblical term for sexual intercourse; and her \nhusband Joseph "knew her not until she had brought forth her \nfirstborn son" (Matthew 1:25). \n\nDivinely begotten firstborn children were sacer singled out for a \nspecial fate from the earliest times, when first fruits of all kinds were \noffered to the same deities supposed to have given them. Firstborn sons \nembodied the god, became the god, and were offered to the god. A \nmass sacrifice of firstborn sons in Egypt, to appease the deities during a \nsevere drought, was recorded in the Old Testament by Jewish scribes \nwho revised the legend to claim their own Yahweh was responsible for \nkilling the Egyptian children (Exodus 12:29). \n\nActually, Egyptian firstborn-sacrifice came from very ancient tradi- \ntions. The Book of the Dead said, "On the day of hacking in pieces \nthe firstborn ... the mighty ones in heaven light the fire under the \ncauldrons where are heaped up the thighs of the firstborn." 4 Under \nthe later dynasties these may have been animal sacrifices, but the \nhieroglyphic sign of the "thighs" showed human legs, not animal \nlegs. The Bible says Yahweh copied the act of Egypt\'s "mighty ones in \nheaven," and sent out fire to consume the sons of Aaron on the altar \n(Leviticus 10:2). \n\nLike an Egyptian god, Yahweh told his priests: "Sanctify unto me \nall the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children \nof Israel, both of man and of beast; it is mine" (Exodus 13:2). Firstborn \nchildren were offered on Yahweh\'s altars until priests began to permit \nredemption of the child by offering a lamb instead (Exodus 13:1 5). \nThus the paschal lamb of the Passover legend was really a substitute \nfor the son, just as the ram who replaced Isaac on Yahweh\'s altar also \nrepresented a transition from human to animal sacrifice (Genesis \n22:9-13). The story of Isaac and the ram probably was copied from the \nBoeotian myth of the king\'s firstborn son Phrixus, who was to be \nsacrificed on the altar, when the ram of the Golden Fleece miraculoush \nappeared as a substitute victim. 5 \n\nYahweh\'s acceptance of an animal sacrifice in place of a human \none didn\'t necessarily mean he was more humane than contemporary \ngods elsewhere. Long before the period allotted to Abraham, Oriental \nnations had been offering animals instead of human victims. 6 Indeed, \nthe Jews seem to have clung to the older custom for a longer time than \nmost of their contemporaries. They ignored Hadrian\'s prohibition of \nhuman sacrifice, and continued in secret to sustain their god on humam \nblood, as in the rites of the Essenic Christos. 7 See Virgin Birth. \n\n\n\n312 \n\n\n\nRomans may have given up human sacrifice, but they had not \nriven up the ceremony of firstborn-conception. Roman brides rou- \ntinely deflowered themselves on the carved phalli of Hermes, Tutunus, \nj-\'riapus, or some other "anointed" god before lying with their \nbridegrooms, so their firstborn children would be god-begotten. 8 It was \ntommon everywhere to refer to firstborn children as "born by the \ntrace of God." 9 \n\nFathers of the Christian church deplored the custom, because it \n|nade an everyday event of the birth of a Christos which they \n[referred to consider miraculous. St. Augustine denounced Roman \nlomen for encouraging young brides to "come and sit on the \nriasculine monstrosity representing Priapus." The women, he said, \nriewed this custom as "very honest and religious." 10 Lactantius \njxplained that the idea of the ceremony was to render the bride fruitful \nby her communion with the divine nature." u \n\nAfter the "divine nature" of these priapic gods was declared a \nlevilish nature, yet the ceremony may have persisted, as indicated by \nhedieval witches\' description of intercourse with the devil. They \nlaimed his penis was hard and cold, and his body was "cold all over, \nIke a creature of stone." 12 Such a "devil" could well have been a \nfeature of stone in fact that is, a statue of Priapus or one of the \nllther phallic gods, believed to beget Antichrist in the classical manner, \nb the firstborn of a virgin mother. \n\n1.

It was associated \ndth the "Fishy Smell" that Hindus made a title of the yonic Goddess \nerself, because they said women\'s genitals smelled like fish. 1 The \nChinese Great Mother Kwan-yin ("Yoni of yonis") often appeared \ns a fish-goddess. 2 As the swallower of Shiva\'s penis, Kali became \nlinaksi the "fish-eyed" one, just as in Egypt, Isis the swallower of \n)siris\'s penis became Abtu, the Great Fish of the Abyss. 3 \n\nFish and womb were synonymous in Greek; delphos meant both. 4 \nTie original Delphic oracle first belonged to the abyssal fish-goddess \nnder her pre-Hellenic name of Themis, often incarnate in a great fish, \nhale, or dolphin (delphinos). The cycles in which she devoured and \nKurrected the Father-Son entered all systems of symbolism from the \nIjws\' legend of Jonah to the classic "Boy on the Dolphin." Apuleius \nm the Goddess playing the part of the Dolphin was Aphrodite Salacia, \nwith fish-teeming womb." 5 \n\nHer "boy" was Palaemon, the reincarnated young sun, made new \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVesica piscis \n\n\n\n313 \n\n\n\nFlidhais after sinking into the same abyssal womb as the dying god Heracles. 6 \n\nThe fish-goddess Aphrodite Salacia was said to bring "salacity" through \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ orgiastic fish-eating on her sacred day, Friday. The Catholic church \n\ninherited the pagan custom of Friday fish-eating and pretended it was a \nholy fast; but the disguise was thin. Friday was dies veneris in Latin, \nthe Day of Venus, or of lovemaking: Freya\'s Day in Teutonic Europe. \nThe notion that fish are "aphrodisiac" food is still widespread even \ntoday. \n\nThe Celts thought fish-eating could place new life in a mother\'s 1 \nwomb. Their hero Tuan was eaten in fish form by the Queen of \nIreland, who thus re-conceived him and gave him a new birth. 7 In \nanother myth, fish were associated with the clots of "wise blood" \nemanating from the Mother-tree with its sacred fountain, in Fairyland. 8 \nThey were called blood-red nuts of the Goddess Boann, eaten by \n"salmon of knowledge" who swam in her sacred fountain. "Poets and \nstory-tellers, speaking of any subject difficult to deal with, often say, \n\'Unless I had eaten the salmon of knowledge I could not describe it."" \nThe fish symbol of the yonic Goddess was so revered throughout \nthe Roman empire that Christian authorities insisted on taking it \nover, with extensive revision of myths to deny its earlier female-genital \nmeanings. Some claimed the fish represented Christ because Greek \nichthys, "fish," was an acronym for "Jesus Christ, Son of God." But the \nChristian fish-sign was the same as that of the Goddess\'s yoni or \nPearly Gate: two crescent moons forming a vesica piscis. Sometimes the \nChrist child was portrayed inside the vesica, which was superimposed \n\nFish on Mary\'s belly and obviously represented her womb, just as in the \n\nancient symbolism of the Goddess. \n\nA medieval hymn called Jesus "the Little Fish which the Virgin \ncaught in the Fountain." ,0 Mary was equated with the virgin \nAphrodite-Mari, or Marina, who brought forth all the fish in the sea. Or \nthe Cyprian site of Aphrodite\'s greatest temple, Mary is still wor- \nshipped as Panaghia Aphroditessa. 11 In biblical terms, "Jesus son of \nMaria" meant the same as Yeshua son of Marah, or Joshua son of \nNun (Exodus 33:1 1), which also means son of the Fish-mother. Mary\'s \nmany Mesopotamian names like Mari, Marriti, Nar-Marratu, Mara, j \nwere written like the Hebrew Mem with an ideogram meaning both \n"sea" and "mother." 12 The next letter in the Hebrew sacred alpha- \nbet was Nun, "fish." \n\nAnother biblical name for the Goddess was Mehitabel, none other \nthan the Egyptian Fish-mother Mehit in a Hebrew disguise. 15 \n\n1.

Thousands of \nyears before the Bible was written, an ark was built by Sumerian \nZiusudra. In Akkad, the flood hero\'s name was Atrakhasis. In Babylon \nhe was Uta-Napishtim, the only mortal to become immortal. In \nGreece he was Deucalion, who repopulated the earth after the waters \nsubsided, with the help of his wife Pyrrha and the advice of the Great \nGoddess of the waters, Themis. In Armenia, the hero was Xisuthros a \ncorruption of Sumerian Ziusudra whose ark landed on Mount \nArarat. 1 \n\nAccording to the original Chaldean account, the flood hero was \ntold by his god, "Build a vessel and finish it. By a deluge I will destroy \nsubstance and life. Cause thou to go up into the vessel the substance of \nall that has life." Technical instructions followed: the ark was to be \n600 cubits long by 60 wide, with three times 3600 measures of asphalt \non its exterior and the same amount inside. Three times 3600 porters \nbrought chests of provisions, of which 3600 chests were for the hero\'s \nimmediate family, while "the mariners divided among themselves \ntwice three thousand six hundred chests." 2 It seems that Noah\'s ark was \nmuch smaller than earlier heroic proportions. \n\nAs long ago as 1872, George Smith translated the Twelve Tablets \nof Creation from Ashurbanipal\'s library, and discovered the earlier \nversion of the flood myth. 5 Among the details that religious orthodoxy \ntook care to suppress was the point that the god who caused the flood \nwas disobedient to the Great Mother, who didn\'t want her earthly \nchildren drowned. Mother Ishtar severely punished the disobedient \ngod by cursing him with her "great lightnings." She set her magic \nrainbow in the heavens to block his access to offerings on earthly \naltars, "since rashly he caused the flood-storm, and handed over my \npeople to destruction." 4 \n\nOld Testament writers copied other details of the ancient flood \nmyth but could not allow their god to be punished by the Great \nWhore of Babylon, as if he were a naughty child sent to bed without \nsupper by an angry mother. Thus, they transformed Ishtar\'s rainbow \nbarrier into a "sign of the covenant" voluntarily set in the heavens by \nGod himself (Genesis 9:13). \n\nThe Tigris-Euphrates valley was subject to disastrous floods. One \nespecially was long remembered; geologists have linked it with the \nvolcanic cataclysm that blew apart the island of Thera (Santorin) and \ndestroyed Cretan civilization. When Sir Leonard Woolley was \n\n\n\nCubit From Latin \ncubitum, "elbow"; the \nlength of an average \nhand and forearm from \nthe tip of the middle \nfinger to the elbow \n(about 18-21 \ninches). \n\nAshurbanipai King \nof Assyria ca. 669-630 \nB.C., military leader \nand statesman. He \ncollected at Nineveh \na large library of \ncuneiform texts, \nrediscovered by \narcheologists in the \n19th century a.d. \n\n\n\n315 \n\n\n\nFlora \nFly \n\n\n\nexcavating the site of Ur, he found the track of a mighty flood a layer \nof clay without artifacts, eight feet thick. 5 Such a flood may have been \nidentified with the watery Chaos that all Indo-European peoples be- \nlieved would swallow up the world at the end of its cycle, and out of \nwhich a new world would be reborn in the womb of the Formless \nMother. 6 The ark and its freight represented seeds of life passing \nthrough the period of Chaos from the destruction of one universe to the \nbirth of the next. Even in the Bible, the "birth" was heralded by the \nGoddess\'s yonic dove (Genesis 8:12). \n\nGnostic literature preserved the older view of the flood-causing \nGod as an evil destroyer of humanity, and the Goddess as its \npreserver. Because people refused to worship him alone, jealous Jeho- \nvah sent the flood to wipe out all life. Fortunately the Goddess \nopposed him, "and Noah and his family were saved in the ark by means \nof the sprinkling of light that proceeded from her, and through it the \nworld was again filled with humankind." 7 \n\nThis Gnostic interpretation had both Babylonian and Hellenic \nroots. Greeks said the primal sea-mother Themis gave Deucalion and \nhis wife occult knowledge ("light") of how to create human beings from \nstones, "the bones of their Mother," i.e., of the earth. 8 Raising up \nliving people from stones or bones was a popular miracle. Jesus \nmentioned it, and Ezekiel\'s God claimed to have done it in the valley \nof bones (Ezekiel 37). \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1, 142; Hooke, M.E.M., 130. 2. Lethaby, 239. 3. Ceram, 314. \n4.

She rubbed her body \nwith an ointment, then lay down in a kneading-trough and passed into a \nstate of delirium, thrashing about, and muttering of Venus and the \ndevil. When she returned to her senses, the friars told her she had been \nto a meeting of devils and witches. On another occasion, Pope Julius \nIll\'s chief astrologer experimentally rubbed a woman\'s body with witch- \nsalve composed of hemlock, mandrake, henbane, and belladonna. \nShe went into a coma lasting 36 hours and experienced many \nhallucinations. 2 \n\nProfessor H. S. Clarke recently noted that many drugs used by \nwitches were known to cause such effects. Aconite disturbs the \nheartbeat and produces peculiar sensations, including dizziness or a \nsensation of flying. Belladonna produces delirium. Hemlock causes \nexcitement and later paralysis. "Rubbing such ointments into the skin \nwould intensify any physiological properties." These drugs, not the \nfat of boiled children that churchmen deemed essential, made the \n"magic" of witches\' flying ointment. 3 \n\nOil was the vehicle for a flying ointment of Roman witches, \naccording to Lucian, who described a woman transforming herself \ninto a night-raven by rubbing her body with holy oil, then flying away \nthrough the window. 4 The flying journey to heaven was the primary \ncomponent of any magical initiation; it could be induced by ointment, \nor by eating the body of a god. By eating the flesh of Osiris in the \nform of bread, an initiate could become an Osiris and ascend to heaven, \nand "in one little moment pass over limitless distances which would \nneed millions and hundreds of thousands of years for a man to pass \n\n\n\nover. \n\n\n\nThough ascent to heaven via a god\'s eaten body was certainly a \ncentral Christian doctrine, the church declared it a sin to believe it \ncould be done by the living, with the help of a non-Christian deity. Up \nto the middle of the medieval period, the church said the flights of \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor H. S. \nClarke Author of an \nappendix to \nMargaret Murray\'s \nWitch Cult in \nWestern Europe, 1 92 1 . \n\n\n\n317 \n\n\n\nFocus witches were wholly imaginary, and it was heresy to believe them real. \n\nFootbinding After the Inquisition took shape, the church said the flights of witches \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ were real, and it was heresy to believe them imaginary. \n\nThe earlier opinion appeared in the Canon Episcopi, written by a \nsecretary of the Archbishop of Trier about 900 a.d., though it was \npassed off as a canon of the 4th-century Council of Ancyra; its \nfraudulence was demonstrated centuries later. It told Christians to \nreject the "demonic illusions" that made women think they flew \nthrough the night air with the pagan Goddess Diana. 6 When the \nchurch\'s opinion was reversed in the 1 3th century, those who doubted \nthe witches\' flights were said to "sin in the lack of true reverence to \nour mother the church." 7 \n\nSupported by plenty of "evidence" from the torture chamber, the \nuseful theory of witches\' flights could account for the fact that no one \never saw the vast assemblages, allegedly coming together from great \ndistances, to the devilish sabbat. 8 It could also account for the prison \nsuicides of victims who beat their heads against their cell walls until they \ndied, to avoid further torture. The inquisitor Bodin said witches left \nunbound between sessions in the torture chamber often dashed them- \nselves against the wall and broke their necks because they tried to fly \naway with Diana or Minerva. 9 \n\nMany women confessed under torture that they dug up children\'s \ncorpses to make their flying ointment. On one occasion at Lindheim, \nsix women confessed to this crime and were sentenced to the stake. The \nfamily of one of the women instituted an investigation of the grave in \nquestion, where the child\'s body was discovered intact. The inquisitors \nsmoothly explained that the devil had reassembled the body to cause \nconfusion. The witches were burned on schedule. 10 \n\n1. Kramer & Sprenger, 104. 2. Castiglioni, 249-50. 3.

Many women died of suppuration and \ngangrene before the desired effect was complete. \n\nChinese men were conditioned to intense fetishistic passion for \ndeformed female feet. Chinese poets sang ecstatic praises of the lotus \nfeet that aroused their desire to fever pitch. The crippled woman was \nconsidered immeasurably charming by reason of her vulnerability, \nher suffering, and her helplessness she couldn\'t even escape an \nattacker by running away. 1 \n\nWesterners sometimes imagined that footbinding produced a well- \nshaped but miniaturized foot. Actually, it bore little resemblance to a \nnormal foot. The four smaller toes were folded completely under the \nsole; then the whole foot was folded so the underside of the heel and \ntoes were brought together. The victim had to keep her feet tightly \nbandaged forever; letting them spread again would cause even worse \npain. \n\n1 . See Levy. \n\n\n\nForgery \n\n\n\nForgery \n\nDocumentary foundations of the Christian church\'s temporal powers \nwere often forged, including the crucial Petrine doctrine of the keys (see \nPeter, Saint). Notable among later forgeries were the Decretals of \nSt. Isidore, alleged canons and decrees of the papacy from apostolic \ntimes to the 8th century a.d., upholding papal claims to authority \nover European nations. These documents were first composed in \nFrance about the year 850 a.d., though they pretended to date from \nthe earliest foundations of the church. \n\nCardinal Nicholas of Cusa patiently investigated the Decretals in \nthe 1 5 th century and found them to be clumsy forgeries full of \nanachronisms and garbled history. 1 The church refused to acknowledge \nthat its traditional privileges were founded on false documents. The \nworks of subsequent scholars revealing the deception were banned and \ntheir authors persecuted. Apologists who tried to explain away the \nforgery were rewarded with ecclesiastical preferments. In 1628, when \nBlondel published irrefutable proof of the Decretals\' fraudulence, his \nwork was promptly placed on the Index of Prohibited Books. \n\nAmong the False Decretals was the so-called Donation of Con- \nstantine, whereby Pope Sylvester I and his successors were granted \ntemporal as well as spiritual dominion over the entire empire, and the \nfiefdoms of the Papal States were established. According to this \ndocument, Constantine made the pope the greatest feudal lord in Italy: \n[Wherefore, that the pontifical crown may be maintained in dignity, \n\n\n\nIndex of \nProhibited Books \n\n(Index Librorum \nProhibitorum) The \nfirst official edition \nappeared in 1 5 59, \nthough ecclesiastical \nauthorities censored, \ncondemned, and \ndestroyed various \nkinds of books from the \nearliest centuries of \nthe Christian era. \nCatholics were \nforbidden to read any \nbooks listed on the \nIndex, which was \nregularly updated. \nObservation of this \nprohibition was \nobligatory up to 1966, \nwhen Pope Paul VI \nsuppressed the Index. \n\n\n\n319 \n\n\n\nfork \n\n\n\nDavid Blondel \n\nTheologian who \nwrote Pseudo-Isidorus \net Turrianus \nVapulantes (Geneva, \n1628) to demonstrate \nthe spurious nature of \nearlier defenses of \nthe False Decretals. \n\nLorenzo Valla \n\n1 5th-century Italian \nhumanist and critic \nof the church, \nemployed as a \nsecretary to King \nAlfonso V of Siciliy, \nwho protected Valla \nfrom the Inquisition. \nLater, he was \nreconciled to the \npapacy and even \nappointed an \napostolic secretary by \nPope Nicholas V \n\n\n\n, \n\n\n\nwe hand over and relinquish our palaces, the City of Rome, and all the \nprovinces, places, and cities of Italy and the regions of the West to the \nmost blessed pontiff and Universal Pope, Sylvester." But the real \ncomposer of the Donation, a papal official named Christophorus, \nmade serious historical mistakes. He made Constantine call himself \nconqueror of the Huns, fifty years before they appeared in Europe. \nHe called the bishop of Rome "pope" two hundred years before the \ntitle was used. 2 \n\nLorenzo Valla proved the spurious nature of the Donation as earl \nas 1440. He wrote: "Even if it had been genuine, it would by now \nhave been rendered void by the crimes alone of the Papacy, through \nwhose avarice Italy has been plunged in constant war." 3 The church \nrefused to admit the fraud until nearly four centuries later. A Greek \nsaying was that the chief industry of papal Rome was fabrication of \nfalse documents. After setting the precedent, "Nearly every pontificate \nwill add its supplement of false documents to this formidable corpus \nwhence the theologians, St. Thomas Aquinas among them, will for a \nlong period confidently derive the justification for whatever the \nRoman Pontiffs may desire to do or say." 4 The Gospels themselves \nwere forged as required to uphold privileges and practices of the early \nchurch. "We must never forget that the majority of the writings of the \nNew Testament were not really written or published by those whose \nnames they bear." 5 \n\nAfter burning books and closing pagan schools, the church dealt in \nanother kind of forgery: falsification by omission. All European \nhistory was extensively edited by a church that managed to make itself \nthe sole repository of literary and historical records. With all impor- \ntant documents assembled in the monasteries, and the lay public \nrendered illiterate, Christian history could be forged with impunity. \n\n1. White 2, 314. 2. Chamberlin, B.

It was also a phallic symbol of the god\'s sacred marriage. 2 Thej \n"thieves\' cross" in Christian iconography had the same shape. Such \ncrosses flanking Jesus\'s cross may have represented sacred marriage. \nThe Y-shaped fork was sometimes regarded as a female genital \nsymbol, in conjunction with the male trident or three-pronged fork. 5 \n\nThe voodoo savior-god Legba characteristically used as his crutch \na derivative of the sacred furka of Set. 4 \n\n1 .

Caesars "constantly had before them, even during sleep or on \nvoyages, a golden statue of the goddess, which on their death they \ntransmitted to their successor and which they invoked under the name \npi Fortuna Regia, a translation of Tyche Basileos (Fate of the \nRulership)." l \n\nGreek Tyche was the same as Fortuna. When she was a Fate \nattached to an individual, like a guardian angel, she was a psyche \nssoul) or anima (spirit). Her Roman name Fortuna may have descended \nfrom Vortumna, "She Who Turns the Year," the Great Mother \nturning the celestial wheel of the stars and also the karmic wheel of \nfate. 2 \n\nUnder the name of Agatha, "Kindly Fortune," the Goddess was \nassociated with a serpent-consort, Agathodemon, a genius of kindly \nrate. 3 On the Orphic Bowl of the 5th century a.d. he appeared next to \nher in the guise of the Lord of Death, "halfway around the circle, at \nhe point of midnight . . . holding in his right hand the poppy stalk of the \nBleep of death, turned downward." 4 In this case Fortuna and her \nconsort stood for a fortunate life followed by a gentle death. The \nGoddess\'s favored ones went to her paradise in the far west, often \nballed the Fortunate Isles. \n\nOn the Goddess\'s magic wheel of time, odd numbers were sacred \n|o her, even numbers to her consort. Roman religious festivals were \nIcheduled for the odd-numbered "female" days, because they were \n[upposed to be more propitious than "male" days. 5 \n\nFortuna became patroness of gamblers when her fate-wheel was \n\nlecularized as the carnival Wheel of Fortune, and she was renamed \n\nLady Luck. In England she was transformed into a fairy-creature called \n\nji "portune," which might lead horses astray, make travelers lose their \n\nIvay, and other pranks. 6 Like most other forms of the Goddess she was \n\nConverted into a malicious spirit. \n\n1.

Bernhardt, 245, 257-58, 288, \n\n\n\nSecond Book of \nEsdras (also known as \nthe Ezra Apocalypse) \nOne of the \napocryphal books \neliminated from the \nEnglish Bible but \nappearing as an \nappendix to the New \nTestament in the \nLatin Vulgate. \n\n\n\nFreeWill \n\nTheological doctrine stated that God allows human beings to be \ntempted into evil, so by a personal decision each individual may "freely" \nelect to resist temptation or not. The doctrine was developed in \nanswer to the argument that God could prevent sin if he wanted to, and \nbecause he did not prevent it, there was something wrong with him, \nnot with humanity. As 2 Esdras put it: "It had been better not to have \ngiven the earth unto Adam; or else, when it was given him, to have \nrestrained him from sinning. For what profit is it for men now in this \npresent time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for \npunishment?" \n\nThe problem was to absolve God from suspicion of a frivolous \nmalice, like that of a child who teases an animal with food, then \npunishes it for eating. If God was all-knowing then he must have known \nin advance what man would choose, which would take the element of \nsurprise out of human sins. On the other hand, if God couldn\'t foresee \nwhat man would choose, and could be surprised by human actions, \nhe wasn\'t all-knowing. \n\n\n\n322 \n\n\n\nScotus Erigena piously tried to thrash his way out of the paradox \nwith a new dogma of "divine ignorance," but unfortunately succeed- \ned in demonstrating that God fails to understand what he created. \nErigena said: "There is another kind of ignorance in God, inasmuch \nas he may be said not to know what things he foreknows and predestines \nuntil they have appeared experientially in the course of created \n\nevents There is a third kind of divine ignorance, in that God may \n\nbe said to be ignorant of things not yet made manifest in their effects \nthrough experience of their action and operation; of which, neverthe- \nless, he holds the invisible cause in himself, by himself created, and to \nhimself known." 2 \n\nThese subtleties added up to a statement that God doesn\'t know \nwhat he knows, with a hidden conclusion that man is smarter than \nGod, because man (that is, Erigena) knows all about what God knows \nand what God doesn\'t know. Theologians who wrote learnedly on \nthe subject of God\'s ignorance were going out on a limb, claiming that \nthey could scrutinize and analyze what they themselves declared \ninscrutable. So troublesome did the doctrine of free will become that \nsome Protestant sects, such as Calvinist Presbyterianism, abandoned \nit altogether in favor of predestination, stating that every person was \nalready saved or damned from birth by God\'s unalterable decree. \nThis idea restored God\'s omniscience, but eroded the incentive to live a \ngodly life. \n\nThere was an eastern folk tale that allegorized the relationship \nbetween God and humanity as between a wizard-shepherd and his \nflock of remarkably intelligent sheep. Knowing that their master would \neventually kill, skin, and eat them, the sheep kept trying to run away, \nand proved very troublesome. At last the shepherd used his magic \npower to put his sheep into a hypnotic trance and gave them \nsuggestions that they would internalize as their own beliefs. He told \n[them they were immortal, so death could do them no harm. He \nold them to trust in their master\'s goodness no matter what happened \nto them. Finally, he told them not to think about their fate at all, \nDecause it wouldn\'t happen right away. There was no need to anticipate \nit. Then the sheep became obedient, and stopped trying to escape. \nEach one quietly awaited its own death at the master\'s hand, believing \nthat it had decided to do so of its own free will. 3 \n\nOne of the "suppressed" verses of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam \nIso made nonsense of the doctrine of free will, after the fashion of \nhe author of Esdras. In this verse, not man but God was made \nesponsible for the Fall, since he had foreseen it, planned it, and \nsupplied the circumstances that made it inevitable: \n\nO Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make, \nAnd even with Paradise devise the Snake; \nFor all the sin wherewith the Face of Man \nIs blackened, Man \'s forgiveness give and take! \nl.H.

Frea, Frigga, \nFrigg \n\n\n\nFreya had many \nalternate names. She \nwas Gerd the Earth \nMother, or Eartha; \nGodiva, "the \nGoddess"; Syr, "the \nSow"; Gefn, "the \nGiver"; Horn, the holy \nharlot; the Vanadis; \nor Mardoll, the Moon \nShining Over the \nSea. 8 Sometimes she \nwas simply Lofn, \n"Love." 9 She was also \nidentified with \nMana, the Moon; or \nHel, the underworld; \nor Nerthus, the primal \nGoddess of the Plow, \nin charge of the fertility \nof the earth; she \nseparated the island of \nZealand from \nSweden by plowing a \nfurrow around it. 10 \n\n\n\nFreya \n\nGreat Goddess of northern Europe, leader of the "primal matri- \narchs" called Afliae, "powerful ones," or Disk, "divine grandmothers": \nthe same as the Hindu matrikadevis or mother goddesses. Freya was \nthe Vanadis, the ruling ancestress (dfs) of the Vanir or elder gods, who \nruled before the arrival of Odin and the patriarchal Aesir ("Asians") \nfrom the east. Myths said Odin learned everything he knew about magic \nand divine power from Freya. 1 \n\nThe pagans said nothing could be lucky without Freya\'s presence. \nEven the gods languished and began to decline toward death, like \nmortals, when Freya was taken from them. 2 \n\nLike all forms of the Goddess, Freya represented sexual love, \nwhich is why her alternate name Frigg became a colloquialism for \nsexual intercourse. Her consort Frey sometimes took the form of a \nphallus. In Uppsala his name was Fricco, "Lover," cognate with the \nphallic god Priapus, from the Indo-European root prij, to make love \nwhich also gave rise to the modern "prick." 3 \n\nThough he was sometimes called Freya\'s twin brother, like the \nArtemis-Apollo, Isis-Osiris pairs, Frey made a lingam-yoni combina- \ntion with Freya. Their names meant "the Lord" and "the Lady." 4 \nSome writers identified them with Attis and Cybele, tracing Frigga to \n"Frigia" or Phrygia, the Magna Mater\'s home. 5 \n\nFrey was the god of Yule, the pagan solstitial festival assimilated to \nChristmas. At the turning of the solar year he was born of his virgin- \nmother-sister-bride. 6 Like other seasonal gods he had a perpetual rival, \nNjord, the other half of the year. They were collectively blotgodar \n(blood-gods), who fought and sacrificed each other over and over. Njord \nwas called the first god of the Swedes, having ruled before Odin \nbrought alien gods from Asia. Frey was another aspect of him, wor- \nshipped in the sacred grove at Uppsala long before it was taken over \nby Odin\'s priests. 7 The grove itself stood for the body of the Goddess. \n\nMany of Freya\'s names were only kennings (metaphors) from the \nhymns composed in her honor by her skalds. Focusing on the theme \nof love, and known as mansongr, "woman songs," these compositions jj \nwere specifically forbidden by the medieval church. 11 Despite the \nopposition of the clergy, Germans persisted in believing that Freya\'s \nsacred day, Friday, was the luckiest day for weddings. 12 \n\nFreya or one of her equivalents married each of the early Swedish ; \nkings: "They were regarded in heathen times as the husbands of the \nfertility goddess. . . . [T]hey suffered a real or symbolic death in that \ncapacity when their time of supremacy came to an end." Scandina- \nvian Aryans followed the typical pattern of sacred marriage between \nGoddess and king, the latter becoming identified with the male \nfertility deity whose function it was "to die for the land and for his \npeople, while the goddess never dies. Her function is to weep over \nhim, perhaps to help bring about his return, or to give birth to the divine a \nchild who is to take his place." 13 (See Kingship.) \n\n\n\n324 \n\n\n\nAfter their abrupt sacrificial deaths, Freya kept the spirits of slain Friday \n\nkings and heroes in her Fensalirox Marsh-halls, also called Folk- \n\nvangr, the Field of Warriors. 14 They could be reborn after spending a ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ncycle of time in the wet, fertile earth-womb. Freya\'s Marsh-halls \nrecall the "bog" where Baal-Hadad lay for seven years before he was \nresurrected to godhood by priestesses of Asherah. 15 Like the early \nSemitic worshippers of the Great Mother, Aryans were "men of \nclay" the meaning of their name because their bodies came forth \nfrom Modir. This meant the root of both "mud" and "mother"; she was \nthe same primal creatress whom the Russians called Moist Mother \nEarth. 16 Modir too was another manifestation of Freya. \n\nShe was especially linked with the strange archaic god Heimdall, \nwhose name meant "a ram," undoubtedly one of the ubiquitous \nanimal substitutes for a human sacrifice. The ram\'s horn was Heimdall\'s \nringing Gjallarhorn, on which he blew the Last Trump to announce \nthe coming of doomsday and the world\'s destruction. In the Bible, \nmagic ram\'s horns were supposed to bring about the destruction of \nJericho in the same manner. 17 The link between Heimdall and Freya \nsuggested her Kali-like function as a Destroying Goddess, which she \nwould assume when men and gods displeased her by forgetting her \nprinciples of right living, justice, honor, and peace. She knew more \nmagic than the gods. Her knowledge was collectively seidr, cognate of \nSanskrit siddhi, the miraculous powers developed by the practice of \nyoga. \n\nFreya had so many incarnations and aspects that the scholars who \ntried to characterize her by only one of them soon ran into a mass of \ncontradictions. She was called the Goddess of fertility, love, the moon, \nthe sea, the earth, the underworld, death, birth; virgin, mother, \nancestress, queen of heaven, ruler of fate, of the stars, of magic; the \nGreat Sow wedded to the sacrificial boar; the Mistress of Cats; the \nleader of Valkyries; the Saga or "sayer" who inspired all sacred poetry. \nIn sum, she was as many-sided as any other version of the Goddess. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 144-59. 2.

Friday \nthe 13 th was said to be especially unlucky because it combined the \nGoddess\'s sacred day with her sacred number, drawn from the 1 3 \nmonths of the pagan lunar year. (See Menstrual Calendar.) \nRomans named the day dies Veneris after Venus, their own \n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 \n\n\n\nFrog \nFuji \n\n\n\nversion of the same Goddess. In modern French, Friday is still \nvendredi, 1 and in Italian, venerdi. \n\nFriday used to be the seventh day of the week. It was the Sabbath \nof the Jewish lunar calendar and is still the Sabbath of Islam. \nScandinavian pagans, Hindus, and rural Scots insisted that Friday was \nthe most propitious day for a marriage because it was the day that \nfavored fertility. \n\nFish were eaten on Friday as fertility charms, in honor of Venus \n(or Freya) whose totems they were. Fish are still considered "aphro- \ndisiac" food because they were sacred to Aphrodite. Thus the Catholic \nhabit of eating fish on Friday was wholly pagan in origin. But the \nchurch never acknowledged the debt. In the Middle Ages, when pagan \nvotaries of Freya continued to celebrate her rites on Friday, church- \nmen designated her day as the day of "devil worship." 2 \n\n1.

Subjects were \nusually magical or \nreligious. \n\n\n\nFrog \n\nMedieval totems of witches were frogs because ancient traditions \nassociated the frog with Hecate Egypt\'s Hekat, Queen of the Heaven- \nly midwives. Egyptians made the frog a symbol of the fetus. Hekat\'s \nsacred Amulet of the Frog bore the words, "I Am the Resurrection," \nanother phrase of birth-magic copied by early Christians. 1 \n\nIn Rome, the frog was sacred to Venus, of whom Hecate was one \naspect. Her triple yoni sometimes was shown as a fleur-de-lis com- \nposed of three frogs. 2 To this day, a garment closure of cord shaped like \na fleur-de-lis is called a "frog." Tailors\' folklore said every garment \nshould have exactly nine frogs, which might be traced all the way back \nto Babylonian cylinder seals showing nine frogs as a fertility charm: \nthe Ninefold Goddess ruling the nine months of gestation. 3 \n\n1.

(See Furies \n\nMountain.) \n\n1 . Campbell, P.M., 336. \n\n\n\nFuries \n\nAlso called Erinyes or Eumenides, the Furies personified the venge- \nful moods of the Triple Goddess Demeter, who was also called Erinys \nas a punisher of sinners. The three Erinyes were emanations of her. \n\n"Whenever their number is mentioned there are three of them But \n\nthey can all be mentioned together as a single being, an Erinys. The \n\nproper meaning of the word is a \'spirit of anger and revenge\' Above \n\nall they represented the Scolding Mother. Whenever a mother was \ninsulted, or perhaps even murdered, the Erinyes appeared. Like swift \nbitches they pursued all who had flouted blood-kinship and the \ndeference due to it." \' \n\nGreeks believed the blood of a slain mother infected her murderer \nwith a dread spiritual poison, miasma, the Mother\'s Curse. It drew \nthe implacable Furies to their victim, and also infected any who dared \nhelp him. In fear of the Furies\' attention, lest they might have \ninadvertently assisted a matricide, people called the Furies "Good \nOnes" (Eumenides), hoping to divert their wrath. \n\nAeschylus called the Furies "Children of Eternal Night." Sopho- \ncles called them "Daughters of Earth and Shadow." Their individual \nnames were Tisiphone (Retaliation-Destruction), Megaera (Grudge), \nand Alecto (the Unnameable). Some said they were born of the \nblood of the castrated Heavenly Father, Uranus; others said they were \nolder than any god. 2 Their antiquity is demonstrated by the fact that \nthey were invoked against killers of kinfolk in the female line only: a \nrelic of the matriarchal age, when all genealogies were reckoned \nthrough women. 3 \n\nAeschylus\'s drama The Eumenides presented the Furies pursuing \nDrestes for killing his mother, Queen Clytemnestra; but they cared \nlothing for the murder of the father. He was not a real member of the \n:lan. When Orestes asked them why they didn\'t punish Clytemnestra \nor murdering her husband, they answered, "The man she killed was \nlot of blood congenital." Orestes inquired (as if he didn\'t know), \n\'But am I then involved with my mother by blood bond?" The Furies \nnapped, "Murderer, yes. How else could she have nursed you \n>eneath her heart? Do you forswear your mother\'s intimate blood?" 4 In \nhort, the Furies harked back to a matriarchal clan system like the one \nn pre-Christian Britain, where "the son loved the father no more than a \nstranger." 5 Indeed the name of the archaic Triple Goddess of \nIreland, Erin, or Eriu, has been linked with the triple Erinyes. 6 \n\nThe Furies were also "fairies," identified with witches because of \n\n\n\n327 \n\n\n\nFurrow their ability to lay curses on any who transgressed their law. Such \n\n"fairies" may have been real witches who tried to defend the rights of \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ women against encroachment by Christian laws. Their modus ope- \nrandi could have been similar to that of the Women\'s Devil Bush \nsociety in Africa: if a woman complained to this society that her \nhusband abused her, he soon died of a mysterious dose of poison. 7 \n\nChristianity adopted the Furies, incongruously enough, as servants \nof the patriarchal God. They became part of God\'s penal system in \nhell: dog-faced she-demons known as Furies Who Sow Evil, Accusers \nor Examiners, and Avengers of Crimes. 8 Their duty, as always, was \nto punish sinners. As "grotesques" they appeared on the tympanum of \nBourges Cathedral, with large pregnant bellies bearing the full \nmoon\'s Gorgon face, and pendulous breasts terminating in dogs\' \nheads. 9 Greek art, however, depicted them as stern-faced but beauti- \nful women, bearing torches and scourges, with serpents wreathed in \ntheir hair like the Gorgons. 10 \n\nAlthough classical tradition understood the Fury as a symbol of the \nimpersonal functioning of justice, yet she came to represent men\'s \nhidden fear of women, an image apparently still viable. Psychiatric \nWorldview says: \n\nTo those men who are aware of contemporary changes it becomes \nabundantly clear that there are a number of openly angry women \naround. . . . Men trained to recognize and enhance their own anger and \naggressiveness in a society where rape and revenge are commonplace \nview angry women with alarm. . . . Men see women project onto them the \nfull extent of their own potential aggressiveness. The spectre of an \nangry Fury or Medusa \'s head strikes fear in men, which is then often \nawkwardly handled because men are not supposed to display fear. A \nwoman seeking only reasonable social or vocational equity may be \nperceived by a man as being out to get the kind of revenge that his \npride would require had he experienced the narcissistic and practical \nwounds that she has sustained.

Indian scriptures made the Earth-mother \nSita, "Furrow," the wife of Rama, whose name meant "Enjoyment \nof Virility" and who was an incarnation of the phallic Krishna. 1 Ancient \nEgypt celebrated an important annual rite called "the finding of the \nscepter of flint in the furrow of [the Goddess] Maat." 2 Similarly, Rome \nkept a sexual-symbolic festival devoted to finding "the flints of \nJupiter" in a sacred furrow representing Ceres or Ops, Mother Earth. 5 \nThe city of Rome itself was established by plowing a furrow, an act \n\n\n\n328 \n\n\n\nattributed to the legendary Romulus. A pre-Roman ancestral hero Furrow \n\ncalled Tages was said to be "born from the furrow" as a son of Mother \n\nEarth. 4 ^^^^^ \n\nThe name of the zodiacal sign of the Virgin originally meant \n"Furrow." 5 Its principal star, Spica, was known in Babylon as "the \ncorn-ear of the Goddess Shala." Corn-ear meant the shibboleth dis- \nplayed at the culmination of the rites of Ishtar, Astarte, and Demeter, \nall of whom were also the Furrow. Demeter made Iasion or Iasus her \nlover "in a thrice-plowed field," giving him the name of Triptolemus, \n"Three Plowings," because he entered the Furrow three times. He was \nalso surnamed Soter, meaning both "Savior" and "Sower." \n\nSeed entering the furrow was almost invariably likened to semen \nentering the womb, as shown by numerous pagan savior-gods who \nentered their Mother in the form of seed and were reborn as new \nvegetation. The Latin god Semo Sancus, whose name meant both \n"seed" and "semen," mated thus with Ops and died in her embrace, to \nregenerate himself. 6 \n\nThe classic custom of plowing a furrow for magical protection \naround a town was perpetuated by country folk all over Europe. \nEven in the 20th century, Russian villages were annually "purified" by \nthe same ceremony, which remained exclusively in the hands of \nwomen. Nine virgins and three old women (representing the Fate \nsisters, or Zorya) plowed a furrow around the village at midnight, \ncalling on the Moon-goddess. Armed with scythes, clubs, and animal \nskulls, they struck down and beat any man they happened to \nencounter while performing this magic. 7 \n\n1. 0\'Flaherty, 554; Avalon, 607. 2.

He was carried to heaven by angels. 1 \n\nWhen the monks rewrote his story, Galahad was viewed as a purer \nknight than his father-predecessor Lancelot, whose life was marred by I \n"the vile sin of lust." Galahad was chosen to realize the Grail quest \nbecause he was the only knight in the whole company of the Round \nTable who was still virgin. 2 This Christianized Galahad was said to have j \ndescended from Joseph of Arimathea; but another author announced \nthrough Guinevere that Galahad was a descendant of Jesus himself. 3 \n\n1.

Galileo \n\nrhe story probably arose from a ritual of invocation, to call down the \n\nGoddess\'s spirit into her sculptured eidolon. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nGalatea was another name not only for Aphrodite but also for \nEgyptian Hathor the Celestial Cow, and Phoenician Astarte, the \nlame milk-giving Mother. Pygmalion was a Hellenized version of her \niigh priest Pumiyathon at Byblos. 2 \n\nCeltic tribes from Galatia named after her also worshipped the \nhilk-giving Mother as Galata, from whom Gauls and Gaels traced \nheir descent. 3 Their early-medieval hero Galahad was one of her sacred \nlings. He was a Gaulish form of Heracles, who married the Gauls\' \nncestral Goddess Galata, sometimes symbolized in Britain as Albion, \nhe White Moon, source of the Milky Way. Heracles also was a \nplar hero who lived for a year like Galahad in the palace of the \nGoddess, at the hub of the spinning wheel of the galaxy (Milky \nWay). In this Lydian story the Goddess was called Omphale, the \ncenter," or omphalos. When the year turned around this hub full \nlircle, Heracles too was supposed to die the year-god\'s death in a fiery \nIheel. 4 \n\nAll the names of Galatea-Galata-Galatia were based on gala, \nmother\'s milk," for the Goddess was supposed to have made the \nLheel of the stars and constellations from her own milk. 5 Therefore the \nMoon-goddess often appeared in ancient iconography as the divine \nlow, horned like the moon. \n\n1.

Before Galileo, all Christendom accepted \nle church\'s view that man and his works stood at the center of the \nniverse, on a fixed earth surrounded by "spheres" of sun, moon, \nlanets, and stars. This was the biblical view, supported by such \n\nrlibles as Albert the Great, Isidore of Seville, St. Thomas Aquinas. \nThe Dark Age had destroyed or forgotten ancient astronomers\' \nowledge of the solar system. Aristarchus taught about 275 B.C. that \nle earth is a revolving globe in orbit around the sun. Eratosthenes \nx>ut 250 b.c. calculated the circumference of the globe at 24,662 \nliles, less than 300 miles short of the true figure, 24,902. About \n40 b.c, Hipparchus calculated the diameter of the moon, and its \nistance from the earth, within a few miles of the correct figures. 1 But \ncording to Christian authorities, this information was pagan and \nlerefore heretical and wrong. \n\nAlmost two millenia later, Nicholas Copernicus patiently observed \nnd calculated his way back to the knowledge that the earth moves \n\n\n\n333 \n\n\n\nGalileo \n\n\n\nIndex of \nProhibited Books \n\n(Index Librorum \nProhibitorum) The \nfirst official edition \nappeared in 1559, \nthough ecclesiastical \nauthorities censored, \ncondemned, and \ndestroyed various \nkinds of books from the \nearliest centuries of \nthe Christian era. \nCatholics were \nforbidden to read any \nbooks listed on the \nIndex, which was \nregularly updated. \nObservation of this \nprohibition was \nobligatory up to 1966, \nwhen Pope Paul VI \nsuppressed the Index. \n\n\n\naround the sun. After hesitating and re-checking his results for nearly 1 \nthirty years, Copernicus published his book in 1 543. It was not well \nreceived by Catholics or Protestants. Martin Luther scoffed at it: \n"People give ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that the \nearth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the \nmoon. . . . This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astrono- \nmy; but sacred scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to \nstand still, and not the earth." 2 \n\nThe Roman church investigated Copernicus\'s theory by consult- \ningthe scriptures, and placed his book on the Index of Prohibited \nBooks, where it remained until 1835. The pope announced, "The first \nproposition, that the sun is the center and does not revolve about the \nearth, is foolish, absurd, false in theology and heretical, because express- \nly contrary to Holy Scripture. The second proposition, that the earth \nrevolves about the sun and is not the center, is absurd, false in \nphilosophy and . . . opposed to the true faith." \n\nCopernicus\'s calculations nevertheless fascinated Giordano Bruno, \nwho accepted the heliocentric theory, attacked St. Thomas Aquinas\'s I \ncosmology of the spheres, published an early elucidation of the nebular \nhypothesis, and even developed something like a theory of evolution. I \nHe also doubted the reality of witchcraft and asserted that most women \nburned at the stake were innocent. He was silenced in the same way: I \nburned on the Campo dei Fiori in 1600. \n\nTen years later, Galileo\'s little telescope revealed the phases of \nVenus, the moons of Jupiter, and the moving spots on the sun. Galileo \ninvited clergymen to look through the telescope for themselves, but \nthey refused, saying it would imperil their souls because objects like the \nmoons of Jupiter were illusions of the devil. The Church said there \ncould be only seven planets, because scripture presented seven archan- \ngels, seven churches of Asia, seven golden candlesticks, and other \nsuch allegories. One of the church\'s main objections at the time to \nGalileo\'s discoveries was that they upset the received knowledge of \nthe zodiacal system; learned ecclesiastics leaned heavily on the guidance \nof astrology. \n\nIn 1632, Galileo published his Dialogue, with overwhelming prod \nof the Copernican theory. There was a storm of opposition from the | \nchurch, which went on for many years and involved priests, cardinals, I \nand two popes. A document was forged and "found" in the church\'s I \nfiles, to the effect that Galileo had been previously forbidden to teach or \ndiscuss Copernicanism, on pain of punishment by the Inquisition. \nGalileo was arrested, threatened with torture, and forced to abjure on I \nhis knees, vowing to "curse and detest the error and the heresy of the I \nmovement of the earth." According to legend, he went on to whisper I \nunder his breath, Eppursimuove "But it does move." Pope Paul \nV closed the subject with a solemn statement: "The doctrine of the \ndouble motion of the earth about its axis and about the sun is false, \nand entirely contrary to Holy Scripture." 3 \n\n\n\n334 \n\n\n\nThe pope forbade interment of Galileo\'s remains in his family \ntomb, directing that he be buried without ceremony, monument, or \nepitaph. His memory was execrated for two centuries, for what Pope \nUrban VIII called "so great a scandal to Christendom." Ecclesiastical \ncensors ordered that a later scientific work calling Galileo "renowned" \nmust alter the word to "notorious." In 1846, Monsignor Marini was \ngiven the job of publishing the records of Galileo\'s trial and falsifying \nthem to the church\'s advantage. The deception was uncovered by \nM. L\'Epinois twenty years later. 4 \n\nMany books were hurried forth under ecclesiastical auspices to \nconfute Galileo. Some contained very quaint reasoning, like \nChiaramonti\'s: \n\nAnimals, which move, have limbs and muscles; the earth has no limbs or \nmuscles, therefore it does not move. It is angels who make Saturn, \nJupiter, the sun, etc., turn round. If the earth revolves, it must also have an \nangel in the center to set it in motion; but only devils live there; it \nwould therefore be a devil who would impart motion to the earth. 5 \n\nThe naive theology of the time often declared that if the earth \nmoved, a stone dropped from a height would fall some way behind the \nspot directly below. Theology was shackled to the dictum of St. \nAugustine: "Nothing is to be accepted save on the authority of the \nScripture, since greater is that authority than all the powers of the \nhuman mind." 6 Voetius in 17th-century Utrecht repeated the same \ndictum: "Not a word is contained in the Holy Scriptures which is not \nin the strictest sense inspired, the very punctuation not excepted." 7 \n\nEven in the late 1 9th century, churchmen were still beating the \ndead horse of biblical cosmology. A president of the Lutheran \nTeachers\' Seminary published a book refuting Copernicus, Galileo, \nKepler, Newton, and all subsequent astronomers: \n\nThe entire Holy Scripture settles the question that the earth is the \nprincipal body of the universe, that it stands fixed, and that sun and \nmoon serve only to light it. . . . God never lies, never makes a mistake; ou \nof his mouth comes only truth when he speaks of the structure of the \nuniverse, of the earth, sun, moon, and stars. 8 \n\nIn 1885 the Catholic scholar St. George Mivart realized that \nGod had indeed lied about the structure of the universe, and hypothe- \nsized that God had deliberately led his popes and cardinals into error \njin order to teach them that astronomy lay outside their jurisdiction. This \n[became the accepted Catholic view of the Galileo fiasco. 9 It was a \n(view that did irreparable damage to the doctrine of papal infallibility, and \nlopened the way to future doubts about God\'s veracity. If he deceived \nIhis chosen envoys in one matter, who could be sure he didn\'t deceive \nIthem in others? \n\nThe battle with Galileo set the pattern for three centuries of \n[ecclesiastical condemnation of each new discovery in an Age of \nEnlightenment when almost all scientific knowledge was found to be \n\n\n\nGalileo \n\n\n\nM.

Bernouilli was forced to \nexpunge from his works the proof that the living body constantly \nchanges its parts, because this contradicted the church\'s doctrine of the \nresurrection of the flesh. The Egyptologist Sir J. G. Wilkinson had to \n"modify" ancient Egyptian chronology because it interfered with the \nbiblical flood myth. Dr. Franz Gall was forbidden to study the struc- \nture of the human brain on the ground that it was "blasphemous." 10 \nNearly every important scientific book of these three centuries \nappeared on the Index of Prohibited Books, "infallibly" declared false \nbecause it contradicted the Bible. The biologist Huxley said he encoun- \ntered in every path of natural science a barrier reading: "No \nthoroughfare. Moses." 11 In 1832, Pope Gregory XVI\'s encyclical \nMirari vos declared war on (1) all forms of society founded on liberty \nof conscience; (2) liberty of the press, "which cannot be sufficiently \nexecrated and condemned, for by its means all evil doctrines are \npropagated"; and (3) liberty of scientific research. 12 Stanton says, "All \nthrough the centuries scholars and scientists have been imprisoned, \ntortured and burned alive for some discovery which seemed to conflict \nwith a petty text of Scripture." 13 The Galileo case was the very \nbeginning of a long retreat. \n\nI.

Garlic and garlic-eaters were taboo in Greco-Roman \ntemples of the Mother of the Gods.

Prince of Gehenna was Arsiel, copied from the \nBabylonian netherworld god Aciel, "Black Sun," negative aspect of the \nsun god. 2 In Gehenna\'s central pit lived the serpent-angel Apollyon, \nanother name for the same negative aspect of the sun god Apollo \n(Revelation 9:11). \n\n1.

Each Roman man had his personal genius \nas a guardian angel or familiar; each woman had a corresponding \nfemale spirit called a juno. 1 In the time of the empire, the word genius \ncame to be applied to both sexes. Official prayers were addressed to \nthe "Genius of Rome, whether masculine or feminine, whether god or \ngoddess." 2 \n\nThe meaning of genius changed again in the Middle Ages, when it \nwas virtually synonymous with "spirit." One could speak of a genius \nloci, spirit of a place; or an "evil genius," a demon. The modern \nmeaning, an exceptionally intelligent or inspired person, was of late \norigin. In 1875 a.d., James Hinton defined genius as "the woman in \nman." 3 In this sense a genius was very similar to a Muse or a Shakti. \n\n1. Rose, 193. 2. Dumezil, 39. 3.

Medieval custom \nhonored St. George on Easter Monday, the Moon-day following the \nSun-day of the Christian hero. Folklore named the pagan savior Green \nGeorge, a spirit of spring. 1 His image was common in old church \ncarvings, a human head surrounded by leaves or looking out of a tree \ntrunk. Some called him the witches\' god, "a confused idea of \nsomething between a tree and a man," or "the devil in the shape of a \ntrunk of a tree . . . with some form of a human face." 2 \n\nSt. George the Dragon-slayer apparently evolved from a mythic \nmeld of Green George with an Arian bishop of Alexandria who \nopposed St. Athanasius, and put to death an orthodox Master of the \nMint named Dracontius, "Dragon." ? \n\nSt. George\'s emblem was a vesica piscis, a prime fertility symbol \nbecause it represented the Goddess\'s yoni; but Christian authorities \npreferred to interpret it as a "shield." Still, George was so shamelessly \ninvolved in fertility rites that the church discredited him and began \n\n\n\n339 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhora calling him "the imaginary saint." An old English ballad said: "Some \n\nGiants say there was no George; some, that there no Dragon was; pray God, \n\n^ mmmmmmm ^^^^ m there was at least a maid." 4 \n\n1. Frazer, G.B., 145-46. 2.

Ghora personified a primal taboo, as did the Greek Gorgon \nwho was also "Horrible." Ghora was destructive, therefore sacrificed \nwith his siblings "for the sake of the three universes," for these boar- \nchildren were capable of destroying even the gods in the highest \nheaven. 1 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty, 193-96. \n\n\n\nGhost \n\nA cognate of "guest," both words rooted in Germanic Geist, original- \nly a spirit of a dead ancestor invited to tribal feasts on such occasions as \nSamhain (Halloween) and other solemn ceremonies. Many Europe- \nan peoples preserved the heads or skulls of ancestors, which were set up, \npainted, and decorated, in a prominent position at gatherings of the \nclan, and were consulted for oracles after being offered their portion of \nthe collation. Hence the "Death\'s-head at the feast." During later \nChristian times the custom was discouraged, for the church\'s doctrine of \nresurrection of the flesh forbade burial of bodies without heads. \nNevertheless, the visiting ghost was an ineradicable belief. Ghosts were \nsupposed to haunt all the scenes of their former lives, especially if \nthey died violently or unhappily, or were buried in unconsecrated \nground, or had possessed evil spirits. The earlier, more benevolent \ntype of family ghost is still suggested by the identical pronunciation of \n"ghost" and "guest" in northern England. 1 The anger of ghosts was \nmost feared by people who refused to honor them as guests. \nl.Hazlitt.27. \n\n\n\nGiants \n\nAppearing in every mythology as a primal Elder Race, giants \nwere obvious projections of every child\'s earliest perceptions of the adult \nworld. Like grownups seen through the eye of the toddler, giants \n\n\n\n340 \n\n\n\nItended to be fearsome, sometimes bloodthirsty but sometimes benevo- Giants \n\nBlent; possessors of an arcane ancient wisdom; and adepts of magic. \n\nAccording to the Bible, giants were like all Savior-figures up to and ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n(including Jesus: offspring of divine fathers and human mothers \n(Genesis 6:4). Semitic tradition held that all the biblical patriarchs were \n\n\n\nof enormous size. Abraham was seventy times as big as a modern \nman. Philo maintained that Adam was a giant. 1 Unlettered Arabs still \nsay the megalithic structures being studied by archeologists were not \nso hard for the ancient people to build, because those people were \ngiants. 2 \n\nLong before the Bible was written, Hindus were saying the same \nof the people of the Golden Age, in the childhood stage of humanity. \nLike parent figures, the earliest races were gigantic, sinless, wise, and \nlong-lived. They died only when they wished to. They could live a \nthousand years because, in their age, life was "centered in the blood" \ni.e., the immortal blood of the Goddess. 3 (See Menstrual Blood.) \nThat this life-giving blood was a feminine effluent is suggested by the \nstory of Thor\'s journey to Giant-land to learn the secrets of the \ngiants\' ancient magic; he could not find the right way until he crossed a \nriver of the giantesses\' menstrual blood. 4 In Greece, the similar river \nleading to the land of "ancestors" was the Styx. \n\nGreeks called the giants Titans, offspring of Mother Earth and \nFather Sky (Uranus). The heavenly Father was jealous of his chil- \ndren and tried to smother them by clinging too closely to Mother Earth \nto let them breathe air. Earth gave her son Cronus the moon-sickle \nand bade him castrate and kill his Father. Later, Cronus married Rhea \nthe Titaness another incarnation of the same Mother Earth and \nfeared the same Oedipal fate from the other end. To preserve his own \nlife, he swallowed his children. The mother saved one of them, Zeus, \nwho did indeed attack his father and marry the same Mother Earth \nunder a variety of her names Hera, Olympia, Rhea, Gaea, or \nDanae. The Oedipal theme of the father-son rivals almost always \nappears in connection with the giant-myths. 5 \n\nGreeks assigned to the Titans all the crude religious rites of their \nancestors, such as cannibalistic sacraments and dismemberment of \ndivine victims like Dionysus or Zagreus. As archaic earth-deities, the \nTitans battled the newer Olympian gods in a myth known as the \nGiants\' Revolt, paralleled by Persian, Jewish, and Christian stories of the \nWar in Heaven. 6 One of the mythic reasons given for the war was \nZeus\'s punishment of the Titans for eating Dionysus\'s flesh; but Zeus, \ninconsistently, himself devoured Dionysus\'s heart. \n\nLegends of giant ancestors were used by Christians to defend the \nfraudulent miracle-working bones of the Holy Innocents supposedly \nslaughtered by King Herod. When it was observed that these profitable \nbones were too large to have come from children less than two years \nof age, churchmen argued that the human frame was bigger in Herod\'s \ntime, because it was closer to the age of giants. 8 \n\nThe Irish said giant people still lived in "the chambered under- \n\n\n\n341 \n\n\n\nGiles, Saint grounds of Tara where dwell the fourth race of gods who settled \n\nGilgamesh Ireland." They were the Tuatha De Danann, people of the Goddess \n\n^ ^^^^^_ Dana, builders of stone temples. 9 Their Goddess passed into medi- \neval folklore as Titania, the Fairy Queen. 10 Curiously, though she was a \nTitaness and the Tuatha De Danann were giants, they shrank as \npopular belief in their powers waned before the encroachment of the \nnew religion. Eventually they became fairies or elves, not giants but \n"little people," the size of children or even smaller. 11 This reduction in \ntheir size was surely related to a reduction in awesomeness. Signifi- \ncantly, their religious myths became "fairy tales" for children, and many \nof their liturgies and sacred songs reappeared in the guise of nursery \nrhymes. \n\n1. Tennant, 134. 2.

His legend originated \nat Nimes, named after the Dianic moon-grave or nemeton. (See \nGrove, Sacred.) He was nurtured in a cave by a magic hind, the \nGoddess in deer shape. He was identified with the Celtic hero Oisin, \nwhose mother was a deer. 1 Like most Celtic Lords of the Hunt, he \nwas slain by arrows. Enacting the hero\'s Liebestod, as he died he \nclasped the same magic hind in his arms. \n\nSome said St. Giles was a Greek, born in Athens, possibly to \naccount for his connection with such deer-gods as Actaeon, whose \ncult was dedicated to the same Diana. 2 Another such hero was Tele- \nphus, king of Mysia. In infancy he was nursed by a doe and \ndiscovered by shepherds. An oracle sent him to Mysia where he married \nthe queen, his own mother Auge, in typically Oedipal fashion. 3 \n\nLike the smith-priests of the archaic Diana, St. Giles was lame, and \nso became the patron saint of cripples. Because of his enormous \npopularity, a fictitious "Life" was composed for him in the 10th \ncentury. More than 1 50 churches were dedicated to him, including \nSt. Giles Cripplegate in London and the high kirk in Edinburgh. 4 Yet \nhis legend had almost nothing Christian about it, and his sainthood \nwas based on forgery. \n\n1.

The principal extant text \ncame from the library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh, 7th century B.C.; \nbut older fragments reveal the story in Babylon at a much earlier date, \nthe beginning of the second millenium B.C. 1 \n\n\n\n342 \n\n\n\nFearful of death, Gilgamesh journeyed in search of Uta-Napishtim Glory-of-Elves \n\n(Noah), the flood hero who was the only immortal man, to learn his Gnosticism \n\nsecret. After many adventures Gilgamesh found the patriarch, who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nshowed him a magic "rose" of eternal life. Gilgamesh took the plant, \nbut it was stolen from him by a serpent. Thus the serpent became the \nonly immortal creature, capable of shedding its skin and becoming \nperiodically reborn without any sojourn in the land of death. \n\nOn his journey, Gilgamesh met the Goddess disguised as an \ninnkeeper that is, the dispenser of the Wine of Immortality to the \nI gods. She was called Siduri Sabitu, the Wine-Bearer, later adopted by \nSufi philosophers as the Goddess Saki, who poured for each man the \ncup of "reality revealed." 2 In Greek, she was Oenothea, "Wine- \ngoddess." 3 \n\nShe revealed reality to Gilgamesh by advising him to abandon the \nsearch for immortality, because the cruel gods decreed that all human \nIbeings must die. She told Gilgamesh to return home, to take pleasure in \nthe good things of life while he could: to bathe and dress himself, eat \nand drink, play with his children, make love to his wife, and "make \nJevery day a festival." 4 \n\nSiduri\'s live-for-today philosophy was copied into the ninth chapter \nof Ecclesiastes, a curiously pagan passage wherein the "word of God" \nIdenies the after-life with all its rewards or punishments, and the Judeo- \nIChristian deity dispenses no justice. \n\n1.

Gnosticism was a general term for mystery cults of the \nearly Christian era and for derivative heresies of the medieval period. \nTheir "knowledge" meant secrets of the after-life, spells and words of \npower required for advantageous placement in heaven, and revelations \nof the true nature of God. Leading Gnostic sects focused on the \nGreat Mother and her Dying God e.g., Eleusinian, Orphic, and \nOsirian mysteries. Angus says Gnosticism was "for over half a \nmillenium the approach to religion for thoughtful minds." \' \n\nTantric-style meditation and sexual rites figured in western Gnosti- \ncism, including sects that were fundamentally Christian.

At first \nhe was accounted a \nsaint, but three \ncenturies after his \ndeath he was declared \na heretic because of \nGnostic elements \nfound in his writings. \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens Ter- \ntullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Car- \nthage of pagan parents. \n\nIrenaeus Doctor, \nsaint, and father of the \nchurch, said to have \nlived in the 2nd century \na.d. as bishop of \nLyons. His history is \nobscure, largely \nbased on (possibly \nfraudulent) assertions \nof Eusebius, who \nclaimed to have \nletters from Irenaeus, \nbut none of these \nwere preserved. The \nstory of Irenaeus\'s \nmartyrdom has been \nproved false. \n\n\n\nfeminine power enfolding the original Creative Word, the Logos, so \nGnostic Christians sought communion with the Goddess Sige (Silence) \nwho dwelt at the beginning of all things. 2 She gave birth to Sophia \n(Wisdom, or Knowledge), the Gnostic Great Mother, both spouse and \nmother of God. \n\nSome Gnostics adopted the Oriental idea of the world soul, \nidentified with Sophia, sometimes in androgynous communion with \nGod. This was the view of the church father Origen, who was revered \nin his time but three centuries later excommunicated for holding \nheretical beliefs. 3 He said, "As our body while consisting of human \nmembers is yet held together by one soul, so the universe is to be \nthought of as an immense living being which is held together by one \nsoul." 4 The trouble with the world soul from the Christian point of \nview was that it mingled the blessed with the damned in one divine \nspirit, preventing the separation of sheep and goats that was thought \nnecessary at doomsday. \n\nThe orthodox church especially objected to Gnostic feminine \nimagery. It was impossible to see God deserving the Great Mother\'s \npunishment, as the Gnostics said he did. Followers of St. Paul de- \nnounced the Gnostics as firstborn of Satan, ravening wolves, \ndemoniacs, atheists, robbers, pirates, beasts in human shape, and dealers \nin deadly poison typical of the insults Christian traded with Chris- \ntian in those times. 5 \n\nFrom the 4th to the 8th centuries, the church incessantly persecut \ned Gnostic minorities. Nevertheless, "Secret fraternities perpetuated \nthe doctrines of Gnosticism and the illuminism of the Pagan religions \nfor many centuries after their supposed disappearance." 6 Gnostic cult \nobjects have been found throughout Sicily, Spain, and southern France, \nespecially the coffrets gnostiques or sacred boxes, like Greek cistae or \nSemitic "arks," dating from the early Middle Ages. 7 \n\nChurch fathers were particularly offended by the Gnostics\' pro- i \npensity to admit women to ecclesiastical rank: "All initiates, men and \nwomen alike . . . might be elected to serve as priest, bishop, or prophet" \nTertullian reported with horror that Gnostic women "teach, they \nengage in discussion; they exorcise; they cure." They even baptized, \nshowing that they had episcopal status. "They all have access equally, \nthey listen equally, they pray equally even pagans, if any happen to \ncome. . . .They also share the kiss of peace with all who come." 8 \n\nSome Gnostic groups went so far as to claim the true revelation ofi \nesoteric Christianity came through a woman, the "apostle to the \napostles," Mary Magdalene, Jesus\'s beloved. They prayed to a two- * \nsexed deity addressed as Father and Mother, identified with Jesus and j \nMary. Irenaeus anathematized such groups, insisting they "repent" anoj \nsubmit themselves to him, so he could punish them with "advance \ndiscipline" that would save their souls. 9 \n\nGnostic principles of enlightenment were incorporated into bardic \nromance, mystery plays, and fairy tales early in the medieval period. \nSuch sources maintained secrets of the heretical religions as allegories i \n\n\n\n344 \n\n\n\nIbolic drama. Manichean Gnostics founded their own churches, Gnosticism \n\nSeparating themselves from Rome which they regarded as hopelessly \n\n[materialistic. They claimed the God of the Roman church was really __^^^_^^^_ \n\nla devilish demiurge who made the material world to entrap human souls m ^^ m ^ m ^^ m ^ m \nBin evil. 10 See Manicheans. \n\nGnostic traditions evolved the Catharan Christianity of southern \nprance and Italy, which stimulated the bloody Albigensian crusade \npee Crusades). Catharan churches claimed Jesus transmitted to them a \n[secret Gnostic doctrine that overrode the dogmas of the Roman \njchurch. Only the "inner man" would rise to heaven, so the dogma of \nihe resurrection of the flesh was a lie. Baptism was useless. Marriage \nkvas unimportant. No one needed to be celibate except the "perfected" \n[ones, who renounced the life of the senses as eastern yogis did. The \n[inquisition accused the Cathari of calling the Roman church names, \nbuch as Mother of Fornication, Babylon the Great Whore, the \nDevil\'s Basilica, and Satan\'s Synagogue. \n\nThe story of John the weaver of Toulouse shows opposition \nbetween the Roman church and Catharan principles of ritual purity. \nKccused of following the Gnostic heresy, John proclaimed that he lied, \npwore, ate meat, and enjoyed sex with his wife; therefore he proved \nnimself a faithful Christian and no Catharan heretic. 11 \n\nOther strands of Gnosticism ran through astrology, alchemy, \nHermetic magic, and occultism. Insofar as the sought-after knowl- \nedge was the natural science that alchemists and sorcerers were \nbeginning to discover (or rediscover), the church opposed it as \ndestructive to the faith. St. Augustine had firmly censured "the vain and \ncurious desire of investigation, known as knowledge and science." \nfret Hermes Trismegistus, the half-acknowledged god of medieval \nalchemists and occultists, had been praised by Lactantius as the \njevealer of "almost the whole verity." Women were involved, too, in \n:he pursuit of natural science. Women were closely associated with \nhe origins of alchemical/mystical gnosis: Theosebia, Mary the Jewess, \nme who called herself Cleopatra, another who called herself Isis. 12 \n\nRediscovery of pagan writings had brought Isis back into an \nnfluential, if secret, prominence. The Hellenistic world identified \n\'Isis of the Myriad Names" with every other female divinity. 13 Medi- \neval occultists in turn found her glorified in the writings of Plutarch \nind identified her with the World Soul, or Sophia. She appeared in \nlumerous occult books as the Naked Goddess crowned with stars, \nler dominion over land and sea symbolized by her right foot on the \n;arth, her left foot in water. Her vulva was marked by a precisely \nX)sitioned crescent moon, which a modern male scholar, with the \nairiously typical vague perception of female genitalia, chose to \nlescribe as covering her "womb." H \n\nOn the whole it was a general rule that wherever the orthodox \nlurches found any hint of female divinity or authority, there they at \nMice found heresy. Persecution of various kinds of Gnostics proved the \nle over and over. Both natural science and feminine spirituality \n\n345 \n\n\n\nGoddess came to birth only with great difficulty, against every obstacle that \n\nwestern patriarchism could devise to throw against them.

Seligmann, 45. \n\n\n\nGoddess \n\nFew words are so revealing of western sexual prejudice as the word \nGoddess, in contrast to the word God. Modern connotations vastly \ndiffer from those of the ancients, to whom the Goddess was a full- \nfledged cosmic parent figure who created the universe and its laws, ruler \nof Nature, Fate, Time, Eternity, Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Love, \nBirth, Death, etc. \n\nMale writers through the centuries broke the Goddess figure down,\' \ninto innumerable "goddesses," using different titles or names she \nreceived from different peoples at different times. If such a system had \nbeen applied to the usual concept of God, there would now be a \nmultitude of separate "gods" with names like Almighty, Yahweh, Lord, \nHoly Ghost, Sun of Righteousness, Christ, Creator, Lawgiver, Jeho- \nvah, Providence, Allah, Savior, Redeemer, Paraclete, Heavenly Father, \nand so on, ad infinitum, each one assigned a particular function in the j \nworld pantheon. During the Middle Ages, most of the old names and i \ntitles of male deities were amalgamated as "secret names" of the one \nGod, while the names and titles of the Goddess were ever more \nminutely classified, and some were even masculinized, humanized, \nor diabolized. Yet such classification tends to disintegrate under deeper \nstudy that reveals the same archetypal characteristics in nearly all the \n"goddesses." \n\nProbing ancient views of the Goddess is instructive. It shows a \nfemale figure almost always more powerful than the male. Not only is \\ \nshe his Mother, the author of his being; she is also the deity who infuses \nall creation with the vital blood of life. Gods prosper only when they \npartake of her wisdom or adopt her powers, until they commit the \nultimate hubris, symbolic matricide, by setting up an all-masculine \ntheology. The strength of the Goddess was harnessed to support new \nmale religions as the strength of women\'s nurturing, caretaking \ninstinct was harnessed to a patriarchal marriage system supporting men. \nEven today, scholars tend to call all ancient deities "gods" when they \ninclude both male and female; and sometimes the oracular utterances of: \nthe Goddess are said to emanate from a "god." l \n\nPerhaps one should take more seriously the ancients\' often- \nrepeated opinion that their Goddess had a thousand names. Every \nfemale divinity in the present Encyclopedia may be correctly regarded \nas only another aspect of the core concept of a female Supreme \nBeing. No modern temples perpetuate this core concept. Men long \n\n\n\n346 \n\n\n\nsince tore down the Goddess\'s shrines, as Christian Gospels com- Godiva, Lady \n\nmanded them to do (Acts 19:27). Yet even in a society that trivialized \n\nand vilified it, the core concept lives on. Some people believe that a ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nnew feminine theology will emerge from the core concept during the \n\npresent century. \n\nl.Pritchard.A.N.E. 1,285; 2, 185. \n\n\n\nGodiva, Lady \n\nThe name of Lady Godiva is simply a combination of three different \nways of saying "Goddess." As Mother Goda, or Gerd, she was the same \nas Freya, consort of Godan (Wotan), father of "Gods"(Goths); the \nold Teutonic d and th were interchangeable. 1 Diva was a universal \nIndo-European word for "Goddess" derived from Sanskrit devi. \nTantric scriptures still speak of a "mother of creation" and a "holy \nfemale river" Godavari, personifying the Western Continent, Apara- \nGodaniya, a land of cattle and of rough barbarians who lived on meat \napparently the Goths. 2 \n\nThe legend of Lady Godiva\'s naked ride through Coventry \nevolved from the Goddess\'s May-Eve procession, which the clergy \nfirst tried to suppress by ordering the people to stay indoors and refrain \nfrom watching it. In Southam there were two Ladies, white and \nblack, representing the Virgin and Crone, summer and winter, Love \nand Death. 3 The black Goddess appeared with a bull-masked dancer \nknown as Old Brazen Face: the solar bull mated to the Moon-cow. 4 \nThe "fine lady" on the white horse in the Ride A Cock-Horse \nnursery rhyme was the Naked Goddess of the annual pageant. 5 Some \nIversions of the rhyme called her the "old woman." 6 \n\nPeeping Tom dared to catch a glimpse of her nakedness and was \n[stricken blind for it, according to the story. This recalls other men \nblinded for looking on the Goddess\'s nakedness, like Teiresias of \niThebes. Such divine punishment, with its accompanying gift of \nIgodlike insight, represented a modification of older Gothic customs \n[whereby the Naked Goddess could be seen only by "men doomed to \ndie," such as Teiresias\'s less fortunate forerunner, Actaeon. 7 Blindness \nIwas a common enough result of peeping at forbidden sacred myster- \nlies. King Philip of Macedon was blinded for peeping through a crack to \npee the serpent-god impregnating the queen with the seed of Alexan- \nder the Great. 8 Perhaps Godiva\'s "Tom" was intended to be Thomas \nRhymer, another seer like Teiresias who spent seven years serving \nthe Goddess. \n\nLady Godiva\'s annual ride was suppressed by Puritans, but after \nthe fall of the Puritan Commonwealth in 1678 she appeared again, \nnaked as before on her white horse. So she remained up to 1826, when \nnew wave of puritanism finally dictated that she must be clothed. 9 \n\nThe original purpose of her ride, to renew her virginity, consum- \nmate the sacred marriage, and thus provide the blessings of fertility \n\n\n\n347 \n\n\n\nCog for the coming year, was at last forgotten. An improbable fable was \n\nGolden Rule made up, saying a human Lady of Coventry rode naked alone, only \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m because her Lord insisted on it. This is all most people now know of the \nhistory of Godiva, the Gothic Goddess. \n\n1 . Turville-Petre, 72, 177. 2. Mahanirvanatantra, 67; Tatz & Kent, 85. \n\n3. Graves, W.G., 451. 4.

The Tantric Sadhaka \nor Sadhu (yogi) was told to "do good to other beings as if they were his \nown self." \' Tantric holy men reached the Middle East at an early \ndate, and may have been the "Sadducees" mentioned in the New \nTestament. The Buddhist version of the precept was "What ye sow, \nthat shall ye reap," which was copied into Christian scriptures (Galatians \n6:7) some 500 years later. 2 \n\nLong before the Bible, Akkadian maxims enjoined the faithful: \n"Do not return evil to your adversary; requite with kindness the one \nwho does evil to you ... be friendly to your enemy." 3 In the Egyptian \nMiddle Kingdom, the Golden Rule was a proverb sacred to Maat, the \nMother of Justice; "Do the other good, that he may do good to you." 4 \nAmong the Greeks, the same karmic law became the law of the \nGoddess Dike, ruler of Fate, who said, "He who does wrong to another, \ndoes wrong to himself." 5 Jewish writers adopted the principle and \nattributed it to the injunctions of Hillel: "Do not unto others what thou \n\n\n\n348 \n\n\n\nwouldst not they should do unto you, this is the whole of the Law." 6 Goose \n\nPatriarchal writers naturally attributed the Rule to male heroes, but Gorgon \n\nthe older sources nearly always presented it as the law of the Goddess. ^^____^__ \n\n1.

She laid the Golden Egg of the \nsun, another way of saying she gave birth to Ra. His solar disc was \nsometimes called the Goose-egg. 1 Some Egyptian writings called the \ngoose Creatress of the World because she produced the whole \nuniverse in a primordial World Egg. 2 \n\nThe fairy tale of Jack who climbed the beanstalk to find the goose \nthat laid the golden egg, dated back to pre-dynastic shamans who \nclimbed the Heavenly Vine, or Ladder of Set, to the celestial realm of \nthe solar deity, invoked in prayers as "the Egg of the Goose \nappearing from out of the sycamore." 3 \n\nLike Hathor, Mother Goose was the godmother of all children. In \nher pictures she always wore the traditional garb of the witch- \nmidwife: black cloak, pointed hat like the Egyptian crown, and magic \nwand. \n\n1. de Lys, 27. 2. Neumann, CM., 217. 3.

Gorgo, Gorgon, or Gorgopis, \n"Grim Face," was the title of Athene as a death goddess. 1 Athenians \ntried to explain the Gorgon face on Athene\'s aegis with the myth that \nPerseus cut off Medusa\'s head and brought it home to his own \nGoddess. But this was a late myth designed to conceal Athene\'s roots in \nLibya, where she was herself called Medusa, or Metis. \n\nLike other versions of the archaic Goddess, the Gorgons were a \ntrinity in classical mythology. Their names were Medusa, Stheino, \nand Euryale: Wisdom, Strength, and Universality. Hellenic writers \npretended they were monsters, but these were not the names of \nmonsters. They were titles of the triadic Moon Mother. Orphic mystics \ncontinued to call the moon "The Gorgon\'s Head." 2 \n\nThe story that the Gorgon\'s look could turn men to stone dated \nfrom the use of the Gorgon-face to enforce taboos on secret Myster- \nies of the Goddess, guarded by stone pillars formerly erected in honor of \nher deceased lovers.

The \noriginal word was godsib, "one related to the gods," i.e., a god-mother. \nIn pre-Christian times, elder women were considered divine because \nthey retained their "wise blood" after menopause. (See Menstrual \nBlood.) \n\nIn Christian times, "gossip" came to mean any godmother; e.g. \nQueen Elizabeth I was the gossip at the baptism of her godson James \nVI of Scotland. 1 \n\nA group of elder women were called "gossips" as a term of respect \nat first, after the peasant habit of calling any older woman "mother" \nor "grandmother." The modern meaning of "gossip" arose from the \nconversation of "gossips," or old wives\' tales. \n\n1. Funk, 256. \n\n\n\nGotterdammerung \n\n"Going-into-the-Shadow-of-the-Gods," often erroneously called \nTwilight of the Gods: the Teutonic doomsday, when all the old gods \nwould be destroyed and reabsorbed by the Great Goddess Skadi, the \nShadow. 1 Like Kali in the Far East, Skadi stood for the primal womb of \ndarkness that cyclically devoured worlds and gave them new birth. \nThe Scandinavian and Teutonic concept of cyclic universes, each with \nits renewable set of gods, was essentially identical to that of India. See \nDoomsday. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 164. \n\n\n\nGrace \n\nIn a famous New Testament passage, the quality said to be greater \nthan faith or hope is caritas(\\ Corinthians 13), translated sometimes \n"charity," sometimes "love." Both translations are inexact. The word \nmeant "grace," specifically the grace of the Triple Goddess, embodied \nin the boon-bestowing Three Graces who dispensed caritas (Latin) or \ncharis (Greek) and were called the Charites. Julian said their grace was a \ngift from heaven: "The threefold gift of the Charites comes to us \nfrom heaven, from the circles of the stars." l \n\nRomans sometimes called grace venia, the divine correlative of \nVenus, bringing visible tokens of the goddess\'s favor. 2 Grace meant \nthe same as Sanskrit karuna, dispensed by the heavenly nymphs and \ntheir earthly copies, the sacred harlots of Hindu temples (devadasis). \nTheir "grace" was a combination of beauty, kindness, mother-love, \ntenderness, sensual delight, compassion, and care. \n\nGraces were emanations of the Goddess. They danced in her \nshrines. They tended to her adornment. They acted as midwives to \nthe gods. They were patrons of music, dance, poetry, and art. 3 They \nwere shown over and over in the same classic pose as three naked \n\n\n\n350 \n\n\n\nwomen dancing, in attitudes strongly resembling those of the Heavenly Graeae \n\nNymphs on the Temple of Love at Khajuraho in India. 4 Grail, Holy \n\nGreek writers called the Graces Aglaia (Brilliant), Thalia (Flower- \n\nBringer), and Euphrosyne (Heart\'s Joy); but they had older names \ninherited from a dim prehistory. Homer knew only one Grace, named \nCale or Kale, perhaps a cognate of Kali. 5 The Gnostic author Marcus \nalso used the word Grace or Charis as a title of the Goddess: "May She \nwho is before all things, the incomprehensible and indescribable \nGrace, fill you within, and increase in you her own knowledge." 6 \n\nChristians took the pagan concept of charis and struggled to divest \nit of sexual meanings for application to an ascetic creed. "Charity" \nbecame a basic tenet of primitive Christianity, as of Buddhism before it, \non the theory that a sure place in heaven could be won by giving \naway one\'s worldly goods to the poor. Jesus listed the blessings prepared \nfor those who voluntarily made themselves meek, humble, and poor \non earth (Luke 6:20-30). The church\'s word for these "Beatitudes" was \nmacarisma, a word of ancient origin, invoking the Triple Goddess as \nMa (birth), Charis (grace), and Ma (death). 7 The cognate word charis- \nma meant Mother-given grace. \n\nCharis merged with "charity" via ancient precedents equating love \nand affection with hospitality and gift-giving, the "maternal virtues." \nHomeric literature used the word philein, "lovingness," to mean open- \nhanded hospitality. 8 As re-interpreted by Christian theology, the \n"graciousness" that used to mean both liberality and warm physical \naffection came to suggest liberality alone, practiced to secure one\'s \nown immortality. \n\n1.

According to the Perseus myth they were less \nterrible than the Gorgons, but Graeae and Gorgons were originally the \nsame triad, the former having more sinister names than the latter. \nThe Graeae were named Enyo, Pemphredo, and Deino: Warlike One, \nWasp, and Terror. 1 They shared but a single eye and a single tooth \namong them, showing that they stood for a primitive concept of the \nGoddess who was three in one and one in three. See Gorgon; \nTrinity. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,129. \n\n\n\nGrail, Holy \n\nChristian myth said the Holy Grail was the chalice used by Christ at \nthe Last Supper when he poured wine for the disciples to drink, saying, \n\n\n\n351 \n\n\n\nGrail, Holy "this is my blood" (Matthew 26:28). After the crucifixion, Joseph of \n\nArimathea took the chalice to England and established it in a shrine at \n^^^^^M^^M^Hi Glastonbury. Later, it disappeared. \n\nThis myth wasn\'t heard in Europe until the 1 2th century. The real \norigins of the Holy Grail were not Christian but pagan. The Grail \nwas first Christianized in Spain from a sacred tradition of the Moors. 1 \nLike the Celts\' holy Cauldron of Regeneration, which it resembled, \nthe blood-filled vessel was a womb symbol meaning rebirth in the \nOriental or Gnostic sense of reincarnation. Its connotation was \nfeminine, not masculine. \n\nThe Grail was kept in a magnificent temple governed by a queen \nnamed Repanse de Joie (Dispenser of Joy), an ancient title of a holy \nharlot. Bards said her husband was a Moor, and her son John founded \nthe eastern order of the Knights Templar, a group of warriors \ndedicated to the Grail temple and the defense of women. When a lady \nneeded help, Grail knights like Galahad, Parsifal, or Lohengrin \nwould receive orders in fiery letters on the rim of the Grail and ride to \nthe rescue. \n\nHispano-Moorish tradition located the Grail temple on Montsal- \nvatch, the "Mount of Salvation" in the Spanish Pyrenees. 2 The \ntemple was a model of the universe, topped by a gigantic ruby \nrepresenting the maternal heart of the world, the Holy Rose. The \npseudo-universe even included a miniature of itself enclosing the sacred \nvessel: \n\nThe temple itself was one hundred fathoms in diameter. Around it were \nseventy-two chapels of an octagonal shape. To every pair of chapels \nthere was a tower six stories high, approachable by a winding stair on the \noutside. . . . The vaulting was of blue sapphire, and in the center was a \nplate of emerald. . . . All the altar stones were of sapphire. . . . Upon the \ninside of the cupola surmounting the temple, the sun and moon were \nrepresented in diamonds and topazes, and shed a light as of day even in \nthe darkness of the night. The windows were of crystal, beryl, and other \ntransparent stones. The floor was of translucent crystal, under which all \nthe fishes of the sea were carved out of onyx, just like life. The towers \nwere of precious stones inlaid with gold; their roofs of gold and blue \nenamel. Upon every tower there was a crystal cross, and upon it a \ngolden eagle with expanded wings, which, at a distance, appeared to be \nflying. At the summit of the main tower was an immense carbuncle, \nwhich served, like a star, to guide the Templars thither at night. In the \ncenter of the building, under the dome, was a miniature representation \nof the whole, and in this the holy vessel was kept. \' \n\nLike the Arabian brotherhood oihashishim (see Aladdin), the \nlegendary Knights Templar waited for the Desired Knight, or Mahdi, to \nrescue the world from tyranny and establish the benevolent rule of \nthe Grail. The alternative was a dire prediction of the Waste Land, \nmodeled on the arid wilderness of Arabia Deserta, which some \neastern sages attributed to the departure of the Goddess. \n\nThe Grail temple was sometimes called Montjoie, "Mount of \n\n\n\n352 \n\n\n\nM \n\n\n\nJoy," like the castle Joyous Gard to which Queen Guinevere retired Grail, Holy \n\nwith her lover. It was the same as the Mons Veneris, or Venusberg. Its \n\nsexual symbolism served to rally heretical uprisings against the anti- ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsexual church. A 14th-century peasant leader calling himself William \n\nKarle, or Cale, adopted "Montjoie" as a battle cry, and banners \n\nshowing the Goddess\'s traditional triple lily. 4 The same battle cry was \n\nused by the legendary soldiers of Roland, supposed to have died in \n\nthe vicinity of the Grail castle. 5 Even older myths said the battle cry of \n\nthe Grail king was Amor (Love). 6 \n\nThe Grail was first converted into the chalice of Christ\'s last \nsupper in the Joseph d\'Arimathie of the Burgundian poet Robert de \nBorron, between 1 180 and 1 199. The origins of the mystic vessel were \nyet suspect. It was formerly a jewel in the devil\'s crown. Sixty \nthousand angels gave it to Satan when he still lived in heaven. During \nhis descent to hell, the jewel fell from his crown to earth, where it was \nfound and fashioned into a cup. 7 Joseph of Arimathea acquired the cup \nland gave it to Jesus to use at his last meal with his disciples. It was the \njcup of doom, of which Jesus prayed to God in a weak moment, \n"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me" (Matthew \n26:39). \n\nThe poet said Joseph was imprisoned by the Jews and left in a \njdungeon for a year and a day without food or drink; but he remained \nalive and well because he had the Grail with him. He was set free by the \nemperor Vespasian, who was converted to Christianity after being \ncured of leprosy by the veil with which St. Veronica wiped Jesus\'s face. \nJoseph then traveled to England with a group of pilgrims, built the \ntemple of the Grail at Glastonbury, and installed the Round Table for \n(the rite of the holy supper. Among his followers was Bron, the Rich \n[Fisher, directly stolen from pagan myths of Bran the Blessed, Welsh \ngod of the sacred cauldron. For a touch of anti-Semitic propaganda in \nthis chowder of fantasy, de Borron claimed the vacant Seat Perilous at \nthe Round Table was the seat of Judas. Another Jew, Moyses \n;(Moses) once dared to sit in it, but for his hubris he was swallowed up by \nthe earth. 8 \n\nAbout 1230 appeared the even more chaotic Vulgate Cycle, \njL\'Estoire de] Saint Graal, a quintet of prose romances in Old French. \nThe author pretended his book was given by the ghost of Christ himself \nto a Cistercian monk on Good Friday, 717 a.d. This work frankly \ncalled the Grail by its old title, an escuele or "cauldron." The company \nDf the Grail colonized the holy city of Sarras, ruled by Mordrain and \nNascien (Death and Birth). Moys (Moses) was snatched away from the \nSeat Perilous by fiery hands. Solomon\'s ship, which moved by itself \npn the sea, carried Christianity to all lands. Members of the Grail \nbompany had various adventures: Bron went to Scotland and sus- \nained a poisoned wound, like Tristan. He was cured by the local \nirincess, then he killed her father and married her. Alain the \nj \'Hunting Dog" went to a foreign land and built a new castle for the \ni Srail, Castle Corbenic (cors-benoiz, meaning either Horn of Plenty \n\n\n\n353 \n\n\n\nGreen, Wearing of or Sacred Heart). The seventh Rich Fisher, Lambor, was slain by a \n\nSaracen with the magic sword from Solomon\'s ship, and the land of \nwm mm mm ^^^ m m m the lost Grail became la terregaste the Waste Land. 9 \n\nA final step in the transformation of the Grail from a pagan symbol \nto a Christian one was taken in La Queste del Saint Graal, written by \na Cistercian monk. Now Galahad was said to be the perfect Desired \nKnight, of the lineage of Joseph of Arimathea. Galahad occupied the \nSeat Perilous safely, because he was virginally pure. He drew the magic \nsword from a stone that floated on the river, for the same reason. \nThrough him the Grail vision was bestowed on all the Round Table \nknights, who promptly left their games, feasts, and tourneys (i.e., their \npaganism) to follow the vision to the ends of the earth in search of the \nreal thing. \n\nThe Queste showed obvious hostility to the contemporary cult of \ncourtly love; but when the Grail\'s aura of feminine mystery was \nremoved, its romantic appeal declined. If the Grail was nothing more \nthan the cup of Christ\'s blood, then there was no reason for the great \nQuest at all. The cup of Christ\'s blood was readily available to all, in \nevery chapel; and even though it was called a holy sacrament, its \ndiscovery somehow lacked thrills. 10 As matters turned out, to Christian- \nize the Grail was to neutralize the magnetism of its secret nature. \n\nThe monkish author\'s real purpose was to tout the virtues of \nvirginity. All but one of the Round Table knights failed the Grail \nquest because they were guilty of sexual sins. Perceval was abandoned \nbecause of his past links with the cult of courtly love. Gawain, who \nplayed the part of Desired Knight in other romances, failed utterly. \nLancelot, having committed adultery with Guinevere, could never \nsee the Grail except in a dream. The only chaste knight was Galahad, \nthe new, purified Lancelot. Galahad\'s virginity led him to every \nChristian treasure, including the shield of Joseph of Arimathea, laid up \nin a Cistercian abbey. It was white with a red cross the same "hues \nof innocence and blood" on the red-and-white emblem of the Assassins\' \nbrotherhood, borrowed by the crusaders, and later by mystics calling \nthemselves Knights of the Rosy Cross, or Rosicrucians. 11 \n\nThe Grail remained secretly pagan for many centuries in isolated \nareas.

By imitative magic, wearing of \n\n354 \n\n\n\ngreen was supposed to encourage Mother Earth to clothe herself in Grim \n\nthe green of abundant crops. The women described as fairies in Grotesques \n\nmedieval balladry always dressed in green; and their lovers, like ^^_^_^_^_ \n\nThomas Rhymer, wore green in the fairy realm. Christians opposed \nthese pagan traditions, associating green with the dead and with \nwitches, developing the "familiar superstition that green is unlucky." 1 \nGreen was also linked with the sexual promiscuity of old rituals. \n\nl.Wimberly, 176. \n\n\n\nGrim \n\n"Mask," often a title of Teutonic deities, like Grimhild. Northern \ngods as well as those of Egypt and Africa were thought to reside in the \nmasks worn by their impersonators at religious pageants. 1 "Grim" \ncame to mean "ominous" because mask-wearing priests and priestesses \nwere traditional givers of omens. \n\n1 . Sturluson, 49. \n\n\n\nGriselda \n\nLegendary model for proper wifely behavior in the Christian era. \n"Patient Griselda" married a man of superior rank, who abused her, \nneglected her, flaunted his adulteries before her, even took away her \nbabies to kill them and forbade her to shed a single tear because the sight \nof her grief would vex him. Griselda endured everything humbly, \nand at last her husband reformed and rewarded her with his true love, \nsaying she had passed all his "tests." So they lived happily ever after, \nGriselda apparently harboring no resentment for years of mistreatment. \n\n\n\nGrotesques \n\n"Creatures of the Grotto," decorative figures in Christian churches, \ntaken from the animal gods, masques, sirens, gorgons, satyrs, Green \nMen, serpent deities, and other idols in the sacred caves of pagan- \nism. 1 Early churches were built right over the heathen "grotto" and the \nsame deities were worshipped side by side with Christian ones, so the \npeople would continue to come to the church by force of habit, finding \ntheir familiar idols there. 2 Some hardly noticed the change, which \nwas what authorities of the church counted on. Pope Gregory the Great \nordered missionaries to "accommodate the ceremonies of the Chris- \ntian worship as much as possible to those of the heathen, that the people \nmay not be much startled at the change." 3 \n\nLater, when "grotesques" were re-defined as devils, churches were \nleft with incongruous images of the rival deities, to which people still \nprayed secretly, or touched for "luck," or gave offerings. Hugo wrote, \n"Sometimes a porch, a facade, or a whole church presents a symbolic \nmeaning entirely foreign to worship, even inimical to the Church." 4 \n\n\n\n355 \n\n\n\nGrove, Sacred \n\n\n\nA common Indo- \nEuropean word for the \nsacred grove was \nNemi (Latin nemus), \nindicating dedication \nto the Moon-goddess \ncalled Nemesis, \nDiana Nemorensis, or \nDiana Nemetona \nLady of the Grove. \nNemeton was the \ndruidic oak grove. \nStrabo said the \ngreatest shrine of the \nGalatians (Gauls) in \nAsia Minor was \nDrunemeton, the \ndruid-grove. Southern \nScotland had a shrine \ncalled Medionemeton. \nFrance had another, \ncalled Nemetodorum \n(modern Nanterre). \nIn Spain, the sacred \ngrove of the Moon- \ngoddess Brigit was \nNemetobriga. 1 \nHungary still has \nMaros-Nemeti, an \nold grove-shrine of \nMari-Diana. 2 \n\nThe Irish called a \nsanctuary nemed, or \nfidnemed, a "forest \nshrine," established \nby the archaic colonists \ncalled Nemed or \nMoon-people. \nReligious rites \ncontinued in these \nforest shrines \nthroughout the Middle \nAges. 5 Christian \nwriters spoke of \n"heathen \n\nabominations" carried \nout in forest shrines \nor nimidae. \n\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Worms for example displayed along one whole side \nthe gods and heroes of the Nibelungenlied, even though the official \ntheology represented these entities as devils. 5 \n\nSometimes the traditions of the grotesques were perpetuated by \nsecret societies among the artisans, especially masons and smiths, \nwhose fraternities preserved Gnostic symbols like the double-tailed \nsiren, the double-sexed demiurge, and the Ouroboros or World \nSerpent, also greatly revered by alchemists and Hermetic magicians.

A large tree, pillar, or obelisk \nwithin the grove often represented the male god inside the Goddess as \nboth child and lover. \n\nBrittany in the 1 1th century still had a druidic holy wood called \nNemet. This may have been the same as the fairy wood Broceliande, \nthe grove of Merlin\'s Nemesis, the lady Nimue, who also bore the name \nof the fatal Goddess of the grove. \n\nPatriarchal priesthoods seemed to consider the groves dangerous. \nThe Bible speaks of many attacks on the asherim or Groves of \nAsherah, which were consistently worshipped by both people and kings, \ndespite the prophets\' repeated condemnations: Exodus 34:13, Deu- \nteronomy 16:21, Judges 3:7, 1 Kings 15:13, 16:33; 2 Kings 18:4, 21:7. \n\nDestroyers of the sacred groves feared the Mother\'s curse, as \nshown in numerous moralizing myths. Erysichthon dared to cut \ndown one of Demeter\'s sacred groves, though the high priestess forbade \nhim with the voice of the Goddess herself. Then angry Demeter \ncursed him with perpetual hunger that could never be appeased. He \nended as a wretched beggar, frantically stuffing his mouth with filth. 4 \n\nDruidic sacred groves were somewhat protected by superstitious \nfear of similar curses. The oak grove at Derry was one of the most \npopular shrines of Irish paganism, its magical name still invoked by the \nbardic phrase "Hey, Derry Down" in the chorus of old ballads. \nWritings attributed to St. Columba said Derry\'s grove must be pre- \nserved at all costs. The saint said as much as he feared death and hell, \nhe "dreaded still more the sound of an axe in the grove of Derry." 5 \n\nSacred kings in Diana\'s ancient grove at Nemi were expected to \nfight any rival challenger who broke a branch from the holy tree. This \nsymbolic act occurs so often in medieval romances that it can only be \nassumed the custom continued through the Middle Ages. The \nVulgate epic of Lancelot said Parsifal challenged a rival knight in the \nsame manner as the heroes of Nemi: he "found a tree in the grove \n\n\n\n356 \n\n\n\nundefended, and broke a branch from it." 6 Evidence is not lacking to Guignole, Saint \n\nshow that breaking a branch from the sacred tree was equivalent to a Guinevere \n\nthreat of castration of the god, or the incumbent sacred king who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nembodied the god. 7 \n\n1.

Even after adoption \ninto the Christian canon, St. Guignole remained an ithyphallic \nfigure, from whose erect penis women scraped splinters to assist in \nconception charms. The priests assisted by installing a trick penis in \nSt. Guignole\'s statue, which could be lengthened secretly from behind \nas it was scraped away in front. 1 See Phallus Worship. \nl.G.R. Scott, 247. \n\n\n\nGuinevere \n\nIn Germany, Guinevere was Cunneware, "female wisdom." \' Accord- \ning to the Welsh Triads, she was the Triple Goddess, Gwenhwyfar, \n"the first lady of these islands," at times one queen, at times three \nqueens, all named Gwenhwyfar, all of whom married King Arthur. 2 \n\nArthur was born of the same Goddess when he was cast ashore on \nthe ninth wave. The Welsh called breaking waves the Sheep of the \nMermaid, and the Mermaid was Gwenhidwy, or Gwenhwyfar. The \nninth wave represented the "god born of nine maidens," also known \nas The Ram. 3 Nine maidens signified the triplicated Triple Goddess, \nlike the nine Muses in Greek myth. \n\nGuinevere embodied the sovereignty of Britain. No king could \nreign without her. Thus, in story after story, she was abducted by \nwould-be rulers. Melwas, Meleagant, Arthur, Lancelot, and Mordred \nall took Guinevere away from the incumbent ruler when they wished \nto make themselves kings. When a king lost Guinevere, he lost the \nkingship. Some myths suggest that she was a sacred statue, like the \nFortuna Regia of Roman Caesars. 4 Yet she was also a living woman, \nwho impersonated the Destroyer when she gave the apple of death to \nPatrick, and was nearly burned at the stake when she was accused of \nwitchcraft. Early legends said she disappeared into the castle of \nJoyous Gard, the earthly paradise, where she reigned each spring as \nMay Queen. \n\n1 . Campbell, CM., 448. 2. Malory 1 , xxiv. 3.

She also ruled fate, as shown by the plural form Guises, the \nFates Who Write, corresponding to Roman Fata Scribunda, or \nTeutonic Schreiberinnen, "Writing- Women." * \n\nl.Gaster ( 764. \n\n\n\nMahabharata Indian \nepic poem, consisting \nof historical and \nlegendary material \ngathered between the \n4th and 10th centuries \nA.p, including the \nfamous Bhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\nGunas \n\n"Strands," the threads of Fate, colored white, red, and black. In \nTantric symbolism, the three colors stood for "the divine female \nPrakriti" i.e., Kali in her three aspects as Creator, Preserver, and \nDestroyer, or giver of birth, life, and death. 1 The Virgin-Creator was \nSattva, white; the Mother-Preserver was Rajas, red; the Crone- \nDestroyer was Tamas, black. Together they symbolized the cyclic \nsuccession of "purity, passion, darkness." 2 \n\nThe Svetasvatara Upanishad said white, red, and black were the \ncolors of the Goddess Maya, who was also Kali. Sattva signified \n"radiant tranquility"; from sat, that which exists forever. 3 Rajas was the \ncolor of royal blood, the color of a king {raj), and of the Mother as \nqueen and battle-goddess, like Durga-Kali, in "blazing motion, violence \nand passion." Another of her names, Aruna, may have been the \norigin of Arum, the Mesopotamian Goddess who made mankind out of \nclay reddened with her lunar blood. 4 Tamas, the color of the Crone, \nstood for "passive weight and darkness," the blackness of the tomb. 5 \n\nThe Gunas were not only Oriental. The same white, red, and \nblack "strands" were associated with western forms of the Triple \nGoddess also. Theocritus, Ovid, Tibullus, and Horace all said the sacred \ncolors of the life-threads were white, red, and black. 6 The Goddesses \nwho held the threads were the Fates. They were based on Oriental \nimages such as the three Goddesses depicted in the Mahabharata, \nweaving the veil of nights and days in an underground "city of \nserpents," representing cycles of light and darkness with threads of \nwhite and black linked with the blood-red thread of life. 7 \n\nSumerian temples were ornamented with clay-cone mosaics that \nalways showed the same three colors, 8 which were also used to \ndecorate the New World pottery known as Mimbres ware. Celtic myth \nassigned them to the Hounds of Annwn or dogs of the underworld, \nand to the maidens in the Castle of the Holy Grail, as if they too were \nKalis or, as the Irish said, kelles (see Kelle). \n\nThe Gunas are familiar motifs in fairy tales, such as Snow White: a \nstory of the princess who not only personified the Virgin in combina- \ntion with the Mother-queen and the Crone-witch; she also displayed the \nGunas in her own person, with "skin white as snow, lips red as blood, | \nand hair black as ebony." Snow White was a direct descendant of \nPeredur\'s divine lady-love, whose hair was black as jet, her skin white \nand red. A vision of the colors alone (crow\'s feathers and blood in the \n\n\n\n358 \n\n\n\nsnow) cast Peredur into a holy trance of meditation upon her image, Gunnlod \n\nfrom which he couldn\'t wake. 9 Grimm\'s fairy tale of Snow White and Gwyn \n\nRose Red came from the same root, uniting Virgin and Mother as ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nEithne the Fair and Fedelim the Rosy, repeated in the lilies and roses \nsacred to the virgin Mary. 10 The same Virgin and Mother colors \nwere combined by the Two Mistresses of ancient Egypt, Nekhbet and \nButo, wearers of the white and red crowns. The same colors were \nknown to medieval mystics in the Middle East as the Hues of Inno- \ncence and Blood. 11 \n\nThe Crone\'s color, black, was often dissociated from the Virgin \nand Mother colors, though the three veils laid on Christian altars for \nChristmas Matins retained the hues of the pagan trinity, white, red, and \nblack. 12 Black animals were sacrificed to the underworld Goddess \nfrom Homer\'s time all the way up to the 18th century a.d. 13 The Slavs \noffered black horses to their horse-headed Lord of Death, Volos, who \nwas lightly Christianized as St. Vlas. 14 Gypsy women wore red and \nblack for funerals, combining the attributes of Mother and Crone. 15 \nIn China however, the funereal color was white, to suggest rebirth. Old \nEuropean ballads sometimes associate all three colors with death. \nThe departure of the dead from Middle-Earth was heralded by "the \ncrowing of the white, the red, and the black cock." 1<s \n\nSo often were the sacred colors displayed in hundreds of myths, \nfolk tales, and even Christian customs, that Dante placed them at the \nvery core of his Inferno, to symbolize the essence of God\'s adversary: \nthe three heads of Lucifer were white, red, and black. 17 \n\n1.

He was born of Arianrhod, the Great Goddess as virgin \nnother, and became her consort. Like her, he was a trinity: Dylan, a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n359 \n\n\n\nGyges silver fish; Llew, a white stag; Gwyn, the white rider on a white horse. \n\nGypsies In these forms he matched the trinity of Arianrhod of the silver \n\nmm mm ^^^^^^^^ m wheel, Blodeuwedd the white-flower virgin, and Cerridwen the deathly \nwhite sow.

See \nKingship. \n\n1. Herodotus, 5-6. \n\n\n\nGypsies \n\nAmong the last active preservers of Goddess- worship in Europe were \nthe gypsies, who began to migrate westward from Hindustan about \n1000 a.d. 1 Because Christians identified their beliefs with witchcraft, \ngypsies were popularly known as Minions of the Moon, or Diana\'s \nForesters. Some may have adopted the Dianic witch-cult through \nassimilation of the lunar Diana to their own Goddess, Sara-Kali (Queen \nKali), also called Laki (Hindu Lakshmi), or Matta the Mother. 2 \nGypsies revered the female principle as the source of life; they said, \n"For us, woman is like the earth. The earth is our mother, and so is \nwoman. The secret of life comes from the ground." 3 \n\nMany Europeans thought the gypsies came from Egypt, hence \ntheir name, "Egyptians." 4 Their own traditions, usually kept secret \nfrom non-gypsies, showed that they came of Hindu roots. They be- \nlieved in reincarnation and karma. A gypsy fortune teller or \ncartomancer was called a Vedavica, reader of the Vedas; for gypsies \nseem to have regarded Tarot cards as their own Vedas. 5 \n\nGypsies\' Goddess was a trinity: Kali as the same three sisters of \nFate worshipped by pagans and witches. Like the fairy godmothers, \nMoerae, or Fortunae, she came in the form of three mystic ladies to the \ncradle of every newborn child. Gypsies\' baptismal ceremonies includ- \ned three offerings on the infant\'s bed, "one for each goddess of fate." 6 \n\nThe three divine Mothers were symbolized by a triangle, the \nTantric yogis\' sacred Yoni Yantra, immemorial sign of woman. \n\n\n\n360 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGypsies\' informal hieroglyphic system always represented "woman" by Gypsies \n\nthe Yoni Yantra. 7 A favorite method of card divination among gypsies \n\nwas to lay out cards in this same "female" shape. Like the Triple Goddess \n\nherself, the triangle\'s three sides stood for past, present, and future. 8 \n\nThe matriarch was the center of gypsy tribal life. "Everything that \nwent on around a tribal mother resembled the old pagan sex rites." \nHer husband was a drone, whose function was to impregnate her. The \ntribe supported him in idleness but looked down on him as a non- \nproductive member. If he failed to beget perfect children, he was \n"accidentally" killed, and another stud-chieftain took his place. \n"Tribal mothers were often widowed half a dozen times over." The \nmale functionary closest to a tribal mother was not her husband but \n"the coaxer," a man trained from an early age to control his own sexual \nresponses and "concentrate completely on his partner\'s pleasure. He \nwas taught to know all the sensitive and erotic zones of the female body. \nIn this curious three-sided relationship, the coaxer gave the mother \nher physical fulfillment without ever penetrating her. Instead, by a \ncombination of caresses, words, and breathing, he made her suffi- \nciently excited to be ready to have an orgasm as soon as her husband \ntook over." 9 \n\nThe queen\'s coaxer was trained like a Tantric yogi in the rite of \nmaithuna, and so were other "occult couples" revered by the gypsies \nfor impersonating the Goddess and God in their endless world-sustain- \ning union. For the gypsy, as for the Tantric sadhu and the Sufi \ndervish, occult coitus reservatus was "a means of increasing psychic \npowers" in accordance with the ancient Oriental belief that all magic \ncomes from woman. 10 \n\nThe gypsy word for a fairy, rashani, actually meant "priestess." \nThe most common gypsy surnames were Smith and Faa: "Fay," or \n"Fairy." n Gypsies were generally practitioners of smithcraft, thus \nbecame involved in the medieval conviction that smiths, wizards, and \nwomen conspired together against the Christian church. 12 (See Smith.) \n\nLegends constantly attest to hostility between Christians and \ngypsies. Laws against vagrancy were invoked, or even specifically \npassed, to enable the Inquisition to seize gypsies and haul them off to \nwitches\' prisons, often without even recording their names. 13 In 1 500 \nthe Diet of Augsburg ruled that Christians could kill gypsies without \nlegal penalty, whereas a gypsy injured by a Christian might seek no \nredress in court. 14 In 1782, forty-five gypsies were tortured, broken on \nthe wheel, hanged, drawn, and quartered for having murdered a \nnumber of Hungarians who were really alive and well enough to watch \nthe execution of their alleged killers. 15 \n\nThere was a popular belief that gypsies were descended from a \nunion of the first gypsy woman with the devil. 16 An English writer \ncalled gypsies "thieves, rogues, and beggarly rascals . . . known by the \nname of Bohemians, Egyptians, and Caramaras." 17 The third of \nthese titles was peculiarly reminiscent of Kauri-Mara, or Mother Kali as \nraie Goddess of Death. \n\n\n\n361 \n\n\n\nGypsies As the epithet "Christ-killers" supported persecutions of Jews, so \n\nvarious epithets and legends supported persecutions of gypsies. It was \n^^^^^^^^^^^ said gypsy smiths forged the nails for Christ\'s crucifixion. The gypsies \npromulgated a counter-legend: they said an ancestor of their race \nstole one of the four nails set aside to crucify Jesus, but had no time to \nsteal the other three. For want of the fourth nail, Jesus\'s feet had to \nbe fastened together with a single nail. Oddly, the transition from four \nnails to three in Christian art occurred about the same time the \ngypsies were telling this story. 18 The gypsies also claimed that Jesus, \ngrateful for the gypsy\'s attempt to save him, from the cross granted all \ngypsies the right to steal. Another legend said gypsies were allowed to \nsteal because a gypsy woman stole the infant Jesus and hid him from \nHerod\'s baby-killers in her basket. 19 \n\nSome gypsies said their race had its own special savior, a Son of \nGod named Alako, who ascended to the moon. He defends gypsies \nand takes their souls to the moon after death. His two enemies are the \ndevil and Christ. 20 Gypsies also prayed to a spirit from Mother Earth, \nthe Pchuvus (cognate with Celtic pooka or Puck), who can bestow \n"earth" on favored people. In gypsy terms, earth meant luck, fortune, \nmoney, like the Hindu artha, riches from the Earth-mother. 21 \n\nGypsies claimed it was very unlucky to meet a monk or priest first \nthing in the morning; nothing would go right for the rest of the day. \nThis anti-clerical idea caught on even among Christians and was still \nfound throughout Italy in the 19th century. 22 Agrippa\'s Occult \nPhilosophy said meeting a monk was an evil omen, "because these kind \n[sic] of men live for the most by the sudden death of men, as vultures \ndo by slaughters." 23 Reginald Scot said when hunters met a priest, they \nthought it such bad luck that they would "couple up their hounds, \nand go home, being in despair of any further sport that day." 24 \n\nGypsy myths repeated classical sacred dramas in the guise of fairy \ntales. The Horned God sacrificed to the Triple Goddess appeared \nfrequently. As a gypsy youth, he ate a magic apple given him by a \nwoman, and stag\'s horns grew from his head. He ate a second magic \napple, and his flesh fell away from his bones. He ate a third magic apple, \ncrossed a stream (the Styx), and was resurrected, fairer than ever. 25 \nHere was Dionysus or Actaeon or Pentheus, slain in his stag mask and \nreborn from the dead. \n\nAs in Vedic myth, gypsy gods were often sacrificed in pig form, \nusually with the all-important apple representing the "heart-soul" \n(Egyptian ah). A gypsy maiden reminiscent of Circe was said to have \nresurrected her dead lover by replacing all his flesh with pig\'s flesh, a \nclassic image of a god\'s or man\'s sacrificial bestialization. When she \nsqueezed an apple into his mouth to serve as his new heart, he \nreturned to life. 26 The pig with an apple in its mouth was also known to \nworshippers of Vishnu the boar-god, and those of his Norse counter- \npart the Yuletide boar (or suckling pig). Egyptians said a dead man \ncould be brought back to life when Anubis pushed his heart into his \n\n\n\n362 \n\n\n\nmouth. 27 Gypsies told a similar story of a gypsy witch who brought her Gypsies \n\ndead son to life again by pushing his heart into his mouth. 28 An apple \n\noften represented the heart. ^_^^__^__^_ \n\nAmong gypsies, "giving the heart" in love or marriage frequently \ntook the ceremonial form of giving an apple. "Occult couples" began \nthe sexual rites with formal cutting of the apple to reveal its magic \npentacle, feeding it to each other with the formula: "I am your \nnourishment, you are mine. We are the feast." 29 South Slavic pagans \nalso used the apple in their marriage ritual: the bride ate half the \napple, and gave the other half to her bridegroom. It has been surmised \nthat a similar ancient marriage rite underlay the story of Eve\'s apple. 30 \n\nCertainly the myths that developed into gypsy folk tales were \nextremely old and universal throughout the Indo-European cultures. \nTheir Goddess Sara-Kali could well have been the original Sarah who \ned her tribe from the matrilineal society of Ur of the Chaldees about \n1900 B.C. 31 Her alleged consort Abraham was emphasized by biblical \nwriters, but rabbinic literature said he was only a Chaldean "astrolo- \nger," i.e., a priest of the Moon-Goddess. 32 The Goddess appeared as \nmother of the solar deity in another gypsy legend, as "an old woman \ndressed in white, sitting in a beautiful temple." She explained her \nfunction in terms recalling the Riddle of the Sphinx: "I am the \nbother of the Sun King, who daily flies out of this house as a little child, \nit mid-day becomes a man, and returns of an evening a graybeard." 33 \nShe also represented the divine Cauldron that daily swallowed him up and \njave him rebirth. The popular gypsy surname Kaldera or Kalderas may \nlave been derived from Kali-Devi as the same Cauldron. 34 \n\nThe Cauldron of the Deep also appeared in gypsy lore as a mirror, \nike the one in which the Titans trapped the soul of Dionysus, who \nvas identified with the same sun god. Transylvanian gypsies called him \nme Enchanted (or Accursed) Hunter, who loved a witch named \nMara or Mari that is, Mother Death. She trapped the hunter\'s soul in \nper magic mirror and took it away from him, the typical preliminary \ni:o his cyclic resurrection. 35 \n\nMuch of this highly significant gypsy lore was kept from non- \njypsies for many centuries, as it was always viewed as heresy by \nChristian authorities, and even folk tales could become excuses for \njersecution. The prejudice against gypsies has lasted even into the \n>resent century. The Nazis declared them "subhumans," along with \news, Slavs, and other "non-Aryans."

His Greek name, Aidon- \neus, meant "blind one," a common title of the phallic Hidden God in \nthe womb of the earth. 2 \n\nHades was also known as Pluto, or Pluton, Lord of Riches. He was \nsupposed to know the location of all gems and precious metals in the \nearth. When he was identified with the Christian devil, the belief \npersisted that the devil could locate buried treasure for his followers. \nLike all underground deities, Hades was thought a leading resident of \nhell, which was often called by his name instead of by the name Hel, \nthe Goddess. \n\n1. Larousse, 211.2. Graves, G.M. 2, 393. \n\n\n\nHebrew "wisdom" \nin Proverbs 8 is \nHokhmah, from \nEgyptian heq-maa or \nHeka-Maat, the \nunderworld Mother of \nwisdom, law, and \nwords of power. 2 Greek \nand Roman cognate \nhagia meant holy, \nespecially as applied \nto the principle of \nfemale wisdom, \nHagia Sophia (see \nSophia, Saint). \nSimilarly in Israel, a \nhaggiah was a holy \nday. Certain Jewish \nreligious literature \ndating back to Israel\'s \nmatriarchal period \nwas probably written by \nwise-women, since it \nwas called the \nHaggadah. Later \npatriarchal rabbis \ndeclared this material \n"not legal." 3 \n\n\n\nHag \n\nOriginally "Holy Woman," the Hag was a cognate of Egyptian heq, \na predynastic matriarchal ruler who knew the words of power, or \nhekau. x In Greek she became Hecate, the Crone or Hag as queen of \nthe dead, incarnate on earth in a series of wise-women or high \npriestesses. \n\nIn northern Europe, the Hag was the death-goddess corresponding \nto Hecate, like the Hag of the Iron Wood whose daughter or virgin \nform was Hel. 4 Old Norse hagi meant a sacred grove, the Iron Wood, a \nplace of sacrifice. Haggen meant to chop in pieces, which is what \nhappened to sacrificial victims dismembered for a feast. "Hags" may \nhave been priestesses of sacrifice, like the Scythian matriarchs who \nbutchered for their sacred cauldrons and read omens in entrails. 5 \nNorthmen colonized Scotland, where a haggis or "hag\'s dish" was \nmade of internal organs. Until the 19th century, people kept the New j \nYear festival of Hagmena, Hag\'s Moon, going in disguise from house j \nto house, begging cakes. A chronicler said: "On the last night of the old \nyear (peculiarly called Hagmenai), the visitors and company made a \npoint of not separating till after the clock struck twelve, when they rose, \nand mutually kissing, wished each other a happy New Year." This is \nstill the custom. But a contemporary clergyman said the Hagmena \nmeant the Devil was in the house. 6 \n\nDevilish qualities were attributed to stone idols of the Hag, such as ; \nthe famous Stone of Scone, still used at each British monarch\'s \ncoronation. This stone once represented the Hag and her spinning \nwheel i.e., Arianrhod, Goddess of the Wheel of Fate. A Danish \nballad said the Hag of Scone led the "swarthy Elves"; but she was \nturned to stone by an incantation of the missionary St. Olave: "Thou 1 \n\n\n\n366 \n\n\n\nI Hag of Scone, stand there and turn to granite stone." 7 Helvetian Hair \n\ni converts to Christianity were compelled to batter to pieces sacred \n\nstones in which their Goddess dwelt, reciting her formula, "Once I was ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n| the Goddess and now I am nothing at all." 8 \n\nIn the 16th century, "hag" was synonymous with "fairy." 9 Old \nHigh German called a wise-woman Hagazussa, that is, a moon- \npriestess. 10 Though "hagiology" still means the study of holy matters \nand saints, the root word hag declined in its meanings. Shakespeare\'s \nverb bagged meant to be bewitched. His noun haggard meant a hawk, a \nI harpy, or an intractable woman. 11 \n\nThe Hag as death-goddess, her face veiled to imply that no man \ncan know the manner of his death, was sometimes re-interpreted as a \nnun. Christianized legends were invented for these veiled figures. 12 \n\n1 . Book of the Dead, 351. 2. Budge, G.E. 1 , 296. 3. Encyc. Brit, "Haggadah." \n\n4. Sturluson, 39. 5. Wendt, 137. 6.

Graves, W.G., 409. \n\n\n\nHair \n\nAs shown by its importance in witch-charms and in the mutual \nexchange of talismans between lovers, hair was usually viewed as a \nrepository of at least a part of the soul. At the ancient temple of \nTroezen, youths and maidens dedicated locks of their hair to the savior- \ngod Hippolytus before marriage; this was "designed to strengthen his \nunion with the Goddess." \' \n\nWhen the Goddess-mother became Queen of Shades for each god \nor man at the end of his life, his soul was likened to a child seeking \nsafety in the mother\'s shadow. The Great Mother\'s hair cast its shadow \nover the approaching soul. An Egyptian found salvation by identify- \ning himself with Osiris, for whom the Goddess made resurrection-magic \nwith her hair: "He is found with her hair spread over him; it is shaken \nput over his brow." 2 When Isis put on mourning garments for Osiris, \n(she cut a lock of her hair to preserve his soul. Egyptian widows \nsimilarly buried locks of their hair with deceased husbands, as a charm of \nprotection in the after-world. \n\nWhen Isis restored vitality to the dead Osiris, entitled the Still \nHeart, she created his new life with her hair, made his heart beat \nagain and his penis move so she could conceive his reincarnation, \nHorus. She "produced warmth from her hair, she caused air to \n\ncome She caused movement to take place in what was inert in the \n\nStill Heart, she drew essence (semen) from him, she made flesh and \nblood, she suckled her babe alone." ? She further protected her Divine \nChild by "shaking out her hair over him." 4 \n\nMortal women often claimed the same preservative magic for their \nown hair. Ptolemy III was protected from harm on his Syrian \ncampaign in 247 b.c. by his wife Berenice, who dedicated locks of her \nhair on Aphrodite\'s altar for this purpose. When the hair vanished \n\n\n\n367 \n\n\n\nHair \n\n\n\nCompendium \nMaleficarum A trea- \ntise on witches and \nwitchcraft compiled by \nGuazzoin 1608. \n\n\n\nfrom the temple, it was discovered among the divine figures in heaven, \nwhere it appears to this day as the constellation Coma Berenices, \n"Berenice\'s Hair." 5 \n\nSigns and wonders in the heavens were usually interpreted as \nsignificant omens of future catastrophes, particularly a comet, "spirit \nof hair." A comet was supposed to be a tendril of the Great Mother\'s \nhair appearing in the sky as the world was slowly overshadowed by \nher twilight shadow of doomsday. Most forms of the Death-goddess \nshowed masses of hair standing out from her head, sometimes in the \nshape of serpents, as in the Gorgoneum of Medusa-Metis-Neith-Anath- \nAthene. On the magic principle of "as above, so below," women\'s \nhair partook of the same mystic powers as the Goddess\'s hair. Tantric \nsages declared that the binding or unbinding of women\'s hair activat- \ned cosmic forces of creation and destruction. 6 \n\nThe same idea prevailed among prophetic priestesses or witches, \nwho operated with unbound hair on the theory that their tresses \ncould control the spirit world. Mother Goddesses like Isis, Cybele, and \nmany emanations of Kali were said to command the weather by \nbraiding or releasing their hair. Their corresponding mortal representa- \ntives could cause to be bound or loosed in heaven what they bound or \nloosed on earth hence the unflagging superstitious belief in Christian \nEurope that witches\' hair controlled the weather. Churchmen said \nwitches raised storms, summoned demons, and produced all sorts of \ndestruction by unbinding their hair. As late as the 1 7th century the \nCompendium Maleficarum said witches could control rain, hail, wind, \nand lightning in such a way. 7 In the Tyrol, it was believed that every \nthunderstorm was caused by a woman combing her hair. Scottish girls \nwere forbidden to comb their hair at night while their brothers were \nat sea, lest they raise a storm and sink the boats. 8 A Syrian exorcism for \nwerewolves invoked "that Angel who judged the woman that \ncombed the hair of her head on the Eve of Holy Sunday," suggesting a \nconnection between hair-combing women and the "werewolves" \nmythologized as dogs of doomsday. 9 \n\nSt. Paul greatly feared the "angels" (spirits) that women could \ncommand by letting their hair flow loose. He insisted that women\'s \nheads must be covered "because of the angels" (1 Corinthians 11:10). \nThus it became a Christian rule that women\'s heads must be covered \nin church, lest they draw demons into the building. Modern women \nwearing hats or head shawls to church unconsciously defer to this \nancient superstition about their hair. Due to identification of bats with \ndemons, the erroneous notion that bats tend to tangle themselves in \nwomen\'s hair arose from the same superstition. 10 \n\nThe ancients insisted that women needed their hair to work magic \nspells; thus women deprived of their hair were harmless. 11 For this \nreason, Christian nuns and Jewish wives were compelled to shave their \nheads. Inquisitors of the medieval church insisted on shaving the hair \nof accused witches before putting them to the torture. 12 Churchmen \n\n\n\n368 \n\n\n\nj claimed Satan told his worshippers that no harm could come to them Hair \n\nj "as long as their hair was on." Some inquisitors preferred to shave \ni body hair too; hence the expression "to make a clean breast" that is, _ \n\nto confess arose from the custom of shaving the chest hair of male \nwitches. \n\nInconsistently, churchmen apparently thought women should not \n(take the initiative and cut off their own hair. Cutting off her hair was \none of the crimes for which Joan of Arc was condemned to the fire. The \ncount read: "This woman is apostate, for the hair which God gave \nher for a veil she has untimely cut off." H Had she been tortured, as the \ninquisitors threatened, her hair would have been untimely cut off \n[anyway. It seemed that men wanted to do it themselves, not to be \nanticipated. \n\nMedieval Europe had innumerable superstitions based on the \npagan significance of hair. Children\'s hair was left uncut for many years \non the theory that their strength would be impaired if their hair was \ncut too soon. 15 Gypsy witches advised the lovelorn to snip a lock of the \nbeloved\'s hair secretly and wear it as a ring or locket. Whoever \npossessed another\'s hair had power over his soul. 16 Lovers often traded \nI hair-locks in token of good faith. If either betrayed the other, the hair- \nlock could be used to cast a vengeful spell on the betrayer. \n\nGypsies said a witch could be known by her hair, which grew \nstraight for three or four inches, then began to wave, like "a waterfall \nbouncing over rocks." This was one of the distinctively Hindu ideas the \ngypsies brought with them out of Asia. 17 The waterfall effect was \nproduced when naturally straight hair was kept in braids, a fashion of \nboth Hindu and gypsy women. During childbirth however, gypsy \nwomen always let their hair flow loose, on the magic principle that \nbraids or knots would "tie up" the birth. 18 European witch-midwives \noften shared this belief, but many also braided female hair into amulets \nto preserve suckling infants and their nurses. This custom continued \nin Ireland up to the 19th century. 19 \n\nHomer spoke of "Circe of the Braided Tresses, an awful goddess \nof mortal speech": that is, Circe\'s hair and words like Kali\'s controlled \ncreation and dissolution. 20 Circe was another name for the Fate- \nspinner, who sat at her loom weaving the destinies of men and \nsinging her spells of becoming. 21 Circe\'s braids symbolized her power \nover metempsychosis; she stood for the cosmic Cirque, or karmic \nwheel. 22 \n\nBraiding the round of Fate was expressed in pagan dances, like the \nMaypole dance, with ribbons signifying the rays of sun and moon. \nOn May Eve, female dancers circled the pole widdershins or moon- \nwise the counter-clockwise direction sacred to women while male \ndancers progressed in the other direction, sunwise. The resulting braid \nrepresented interpenetration of masculine and feminine powers. 25 \nThis heathen dance survives as the "braiding" figure in square-dancing \nknown as Grand Right and Left, in which men and women weave \n\n\n\n\n\n\n369 \n\n\n\nHair opposite directions around a circle, with or without touching hands as \n\nthey pass. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ For the sun gods, hair represented both "rays" and virility. Apollo\'s \n\nphallic function was implied by his epithet Chrysocomes, "He of the \nGolden Locks." Ceremonial castration was the meaning of solar gods\' \nhaircuts, like Samson\'s. A traditional site of the hero\'s castration or \nhair-cutting was Calvary, "Bald Skull," a hill where sacrifices were \nperformed. Romans sometimes called the Great Goddess Calva, \n"Baldness," a name so old that no one knew the reason for it. Like \nMoriah, it may have descended from an altar-crowned hill of \nsacrifice. 24 \n\nHead hair comes in for special attention in both West and East. Priests \nwho wish to conserve their vitality, to "cut off the outflows, " to use a \nBuddhist term, shave it off. His long hair was the repository of the Biblical \nSamson \'s energy. So is the Sikh s. The Indian god Shiva, who is the \npersonalized representation of the creative and sexual energy of the \nuniverse, is always represented as having a mass of long, tangled, piled- \nup hair on his head. Yogis who are his devotees imitate their divine pattern \nin this respect. Abundant hair represents the abundance of divine \nenergy, in the same way as Shiva \'s erect phallus. . . . [EJven today the \nordinary Indian believes that the way to avoid "catching cold" and stay \nhealthy (i.e., preserve his vital energy) is to wrap up his head, even if the \nrest of the body is practically naked. Hence the turban. 2S \n\nTantric sadhakas who worshipped hairy Shiva may have been \nthe original "Sadducees" of the Bible. A related sect of hermits known \nas Nazarites or Nazarenes were distinguished like sadhakas by their \nnever-cut hair, a tradition partly preserved by the uncut ear-locks of the \northodox Jew. The law of the Oriental holy hermit appears in the \nBible: "He shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head \ngrow" (Numbers 6:5). But Christians said a man having long hair \nwas shameful (1 Corinthians 1 1:14). \n\nAn opposing myth, relating virility to baldness, was promulgated \nby Hippocrates, possibly because he was himself subject to hair loss. \nHe said bald men are "of an inflammatory habit; and the plasma in their \nhead being agitated and heated by salacity, coming to the epidermis \nwithers the roots of the hair causing it to fall off." 26 Thanks to \nHippocrates, the mythic relationship between baldness and sexual \npotency has lasted up to the present day. \n\nAnother durable myth claimed a witch\'s hair would become a \nserpent when buried or placed in water, especially if the hair was \nplucked while the witch was menstruating. 27 This was another branch \nfrom the root of Gorgon mythology, where the female head with \nserpent-hair represented "wisdom" and warned would-be trespassers of \nthe menstrual taboo. \n\nHair was so universally associated with paganism that British \nchurches used to command men to shear their hair and beards on \nMaunday Thursday, the day before Good Friday, so they would be \n\n\n\n370 \n\n\n\nhonest" (i.e., "Christian") for Easter. Consequently this day is Hakkni Panki \n\n[escribed in old writings as Shear Thursday. 28 Halloween \n\n\n\n1. Frazer, G.B., 8. 2. Book of the Dead, 54, 400. 3. Budge, D.N., 250. \n\n4.

Circles generally \ncpressed cyclic religions; lines, like the rows of pews in a Christian \nlurch, expressed patriarchal linearity of ideas. \n1. Shah, 21. \n\n\n\nlalloween \n\nII Souls\' or All Hallows\' Day (November 1) was the Christian \njrsion of Samhain, the Celtic feast of the dead, named for the Aryan \n\n\n\n371 \n\n\n\nHa, Lord of Death, Samana, "the Leveller," or the Grim Reaper, leader \n\nof ancestral ghosts. According to the pagan lunar calendar, festivals wen \nHiMHi^HM celebrated on the "eve" rather than the day. Therefore Halloween or \nAll Hallows\' Eve was the original festival, later displaced to the follow- \ning day. The Irish used to call the holy night the Vigil of Saman. \nChurchmen described it as a night of magic charms and divinations, \nreading the future with witches\' mirrors and nutshell ashes, ducking \nfor apples in tubs of water (representing soul-symbols in the Cauldron o \nRegeneration), and other objectionable rites. Even today it is said that \na girl who peels an apple before a mirror on Halloween will see the \nimage of her future husband in the glass. 1 Christian authorities wrote \nof Halloween, "Many other superstitious ceremonies, the remains of \nDruidism, are observed on this holiday, which will never be eradicat- \ned while the name of Saman is permitted to remain." 2 The name of the \npagan deity remains in the Bible as Samuel, from the Semitic \nSammael, the same underworld god. \n\nOf course the original divinations were oracular utterances by the \nancestral dead, who came up from their tombs on Halloween, \nsometimes bringing gifts to the children of their living descendants. In \nSicilian Halloween tradition, "the dead relations have become the \ngood fairies of the little ones." 5 Similar customs are observed at \nChristmas. \n\nIn Lithuania, the last European country to accept Christianity, the \npagans celebrated their New Year feast at Halloween, sacrificing \ndomestic animals to their god Zimiennik (Samanik; Samana). Their \nprayer ran, "Accept our burnt sacrifice, O Zimiennik, and kindly \npartake thereof." 4 If the lord of the underworld accepted the offering or \nbehalf of all the dead, the spirits were satisfied and would refrain from \ndoing harm. If not adequately propitiated, they might descend on the \nworld as vengeful ghosts, led by demons and "witches" (priestesses) \nwho summoned them. The witches and ghosts are still associated with \nHalloween, together with such soul-symbols as owls, bats, and cats. \n\nThe pagan idea used to be that crucial joints between the seasons \nopened cracks in the fabric of space-time, allowing contact between \nthe ghostworld and the mortal one. \n\n1. de Lys, 365. 2.

At his birth, he was laid in a manger. He \n\n\n\n372 \n\n\n\nLvas sacrificed, buried, and resurrected: the sequence representing har- Hannah \n\nlest, re-planting, and new growth. His flesh and blood were Hapi \n\nbonsumed by his worshippers in the form of bread and wine. See _^^^__^_^ \n\nDemeter. ^^^^^^^^m \n\nThe deity was identified with the daily-reborn sun, so the halo was \ntlso a solar symbol, as in Egypt. In Christian hagiography it was \niometimes known as the aura, "circle of gold," which Byzantine art \nIhowed as a golden disc rather awkwardly attached at an angle to the \nback of the head. Still another variant was based on the Tantric idea of \nhe "thousand-petaled lotus of light" sprouting from the head of the \nCompletely enlightened sage. It was called the nimbus or "cloud" of \night, a symbol of divinity long before there were Christian deities or \naints. 2 \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 185. 2.

Hittites called her Hwanhwanar, the Nether Upsurge, married \no a sacred king at the Puruli festival, shortly before he was sent down \nnto her Abyss to become the new Lord of Death. 1 \n\nHannah\'s biblical son bore the same name as the Lord of Death, \nlama-El, Sammael or Samuel, from Samana, a Hindu title of the \neath-god Yama as Conductor of Souls. 2 \n\nIn Old Iranian, a clan matriarch was the hana, "grandmother." \nlimilarly, the Mother of the virgin mother was worshipped through- \nut the Middle East under such names as Hannah, Anna, Nana, \nn-anna, or "Queen Nana, the Creatress." 5 In Christian tradition she \nvas Anna, the Grandmother of God. 4 Mother of the virgin Mary was \ntona or Hannah, just as Anatolian Hannahanna was the mother of \nlie virgin Mari. Sometimes her virgin aspect was named Inaras, who \nf/as also a death-goddess. She annually imprisoned the sacred king in \ntemple tower, mated with him, then killed him. 5 (See Anne, Saint.) \n\nl.Gaster,7. 2. Lzrousse, 346. 3. Stone, 219. 4. Graves, W.G., 410. \n5.

Ancestral pre- \nynastic tribes of Egypt were said to be Hapi\'s children, therefore \nlapi was originally a form of the Great Goddess. Like most of the \nIdest Oriental divinities, "he" was associated with the yonic lotus. 1 \n\n1. Lamusse, 36, 38. \n\n\n\n373 \n\n\n\nHar \nHathor \n\n\n\nvar. Harmonia \n\n\n\nHar \n\nIshtar as the patroness of temple prostitutes or harines was known as \nthe Great Goddess Har. Like Greek horae, Persian houris, and other \nsacred Aarlots, her priestesses occupied the part of the temple that \ncame to be called Harem, the Sanctuary. 1 Kings had to prove their \nvirility, hence their right to rule, by impregnating the harines, until it \nbecame a custom to let certain priests take over this duty. (See \nProstitution.) \n\nFrom the root Aarcame Hara, Hebrew for both a holy mountain \nand a pregnant belly; Hariti or Haraiti, the "Lofty Mountain" of \nparadise in both pre-Vedic Dravidian and Old Iranian cosmology; and \nHarmonia, a "daughter of Aphrodite," a bringer of peace, one of the \nfunctions of the holy harlot. Harmonia was mythologized as an ancient \nqueen of Boeotia, married to Cadmus, whose name in Phoenician \nwas kedem, "the Oriental." 2 When Cadmus and Harmonia died and \nwent to paradise, they were both transformed into serpents. 3 Probably \nthey were assimilated to the male-and-female, perpetually entwined \nserpents of the Hermetic caduceus, whose meaning was "Life."

They had bird bodies \nwith women\'s heads and breasts, suggesting the Minoan style of \nfunerary priestesses in feather costumes with bare necks and bosoms. \nTheir name meant "snatchers" or "pluckers," perhaps related to \ntheir use of the harp in funerary music, since a harp is played with \nplucking motions. 1 Patriarchal Hellenic myth made the Harpies \nobnoxious monsters, but they seem to have been once the same as \ndakinis or Valkyries.

In the earliest dynasties, her name was a component \nof all royal Egyptian names, indicating the archaic matrilineal queenship: \nbased on successive incarnations of her spirit. 1 \n\nHathor was worshipped in Israel in the 1 1th century b.c. at her \n\n\n\n374 \n\n\n\n[wn holy city of Hazor, which the Old Testament claims Joshua Heart \n\n[estroyed (Joshua 1 1:13, 21). The Sinai Tablets show that Hebrew \n\nporkers in the Egyptian mines of Sinai about 1 500 B.C. worshipped _^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nHathor, whom they identified with the Lady of Byblos, Astarte. 2 \n\nSome sources said there were seven Hathors: the Holy Midwives \nssociated with the seven heavenly spheres. They gave each Egyptian \nSeven souls at birth. Sevenfold Hathor entered medieval myth as the \ndry godmother(s) and Mother Goose, as well as the Mother of the \nlun King, the Lady of the Lake, and the Huntress. \n\nIn Upper Egypt, Hathor was Sati or Satis, She of the Two River- \nlanks, source of the Nile. 3 Her Destroyer aspect was a lion-headed \niuntress, the Sphinx, sometimes called Sekhmet or Sakhmis, "the \nj\'owerful." Like Kali, she drank the blood of gods and men. \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 1, 92-93, 428, 431. 2. Albright, 96, 1%. 3. Erman, 4. \n\n\n\nHeart \n\nlb was the Egyptian word for heart-soul, most important of the \neven souls bestowed by the seven birth-goddesses (Hathors). The ab \n\'as the soul that would be weighed in the balances of Maat after \nleath, in her underground Hall of Judgment, to see if it was too heavy \nrith sins to balance her Feather of Truth. The ab was most \nnportant because it was the central blood-soul emanating from the \njsence of the mother. \n\nThe maxim that a pregnant woman carries her child "under her \nHeart" began with the Egyptians, who believed menstrual blood that \nuade the child\'s life descended from the mother\'s heart to her womb, \n[he maternal heart, then, was the source of the child\'s life, which \n| as why a mother called her child "heart\'s blood." The Book of the \n[|)ead addressed prayers to "My heart of my mother. . . . My heart of \nansformations," meaning the source of rebirths. 1 \n\nSignificantly, the meaning of the Egyptian word for the mother- \niven heart was reversed in Hebrew; ab was re-defined as "father." \n\nThe Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for ab was a dancing figure, and as \nverb it meant "to dance." 2 This referred to the mystic dance of life \nring on inside the body the heartbeat. The same mystic symbol in \nidia was the Dance of Shiva, who was supposed to dwell at the \nKiting heart of the cosmos within the world-body of Kali. Shiva went \nirough certain cycles when he was temporarily dead, known as \nhava the Corpse, and his dance ceased until his Mother resurrected \nim again. Similarly, the Egyptian god Osiris passed through a death \nbase before the Goddess brought him back to life. In this phase he was \nlown as the Still-Heart.\' \n\nLike other mummies, Osiris\'s mummy received a new ab, "heart \nnulet," always made of red stone and placed in the mummy\'s breast \nbring back vitality. 4 The custom of removing the mummy\'s real heart \n\n\n\n375 \n\n\n\nHeart \n\n\n\nActs of John \n\nA famous Gnostic text, \nnever entirely \nsuppressed although the \northodox church \nrepeatedly denounced it \nthrough the \ncenturies for its \nheretical assertion \nthat, as a deity, Jesus \ncould not actually die \non the cross. \n\n\n\nprobably dated back to primitive ritual offerings of human hearts to \nthe Goddess, who was addressed. in some archaic prayers as "swallower \nof hearts." 5 As always, the primitive theory was that what a deity gave \nmust be returned at least in part, to keep up the deity\'s energy to give \nmore. The same kind of sacrifices took place on the sacred pyramids \nof Mexico. Victims identified with the dying god were cut open quickly, \nso the heart could be offered still alive and "dancing." The Egyptian \nword ab also meant an offering as well as a heart, suggesting that at \nsome point in Egyptian history the sacrificial victims were deprived of \ntheir hearts. 6 Juvenal said the Egyptians offered human sacrifices and \nate human flesh. The Egyptian Goddess took an underworld form as \na monster Ab-She, "She Who Eats Hearts." 7 The old texts said the \nGoddess devoured what she created, after the manner of Kali, and \nEarth, and Time, and Fate: "she taketh possession of hearts, she \nswalloweth." 8 \n\nUp to the present century, Bantu witches remembered Egyptian \nideas well enough to believe they could cast a death spell by \nsymbolically eating the intended victim\'s "heart life," a concept very lik< \nthe Egyptian ab. 9 Many phrases still in English usage date back to the \nEgyptian idea of the heart as the center of the self, the soul, or the \nemotions. One is heavy-hearted or light-hearted; hope brings "new \nheart"; grief makes the heart ache or break; love steals the heart away, or \nmakes the heart full; absence makes the heart grow fonder; hearts \nmay be given, or taken, or withered, or gladdened; hearts may be warm \nor cold, hard or soft. \n\nSo vital was the idea of the heartbeat in Oriental religions that the \nvery center of the universe was placed "within the heart" by Tantric \nsages. 10 This place was Chidambaram, where Shiva danced to the basic \nrhythm of eternity. The sages said: "Sound (nada) represents the \nState of Power. It is experienced by the yogi when he plunges deep into \nhimself. It is made manifest in the heartbeat. And since the micro- \ncosm is finally identical with the macrocosm, when the yogi hears the \nNada, this Sound of Power, he is listening to the heartbeat of the \nAbsolute." 11 \n\nIn this expression of the basic mystical idea that deity is within the \nhuman being, the sages in effect admitted that man creates God. The \nheartbeat was also said to establish the fundamental tempo for poetry, \nsong, music, and dance. \n\nThe Tantric idea of the heart\'s dance surfaced in early Gnostic \nChristianity, when Jesus was equated with the dancing god-within. In | \nthe Acts of John, Jesus said to his followers: "To the Universe belongs \nthe dancer. He who does not dance does not know what happens. \nNow if you follow my dance, see yourself in Me who am speaking. . . . \\ \nYou who dance, consider what I do, for yours is this passion of Man \nwhich I am to suffer." n \n\nThough the church outlawed ecclesiastical dancing early in the , \nChristian era, the theme of the dancing god within the heart was not \nforgotten. Eventually it led to the concept of the Sacred Heart, adopted \n\n\n\n376 \n\n\n\ns an article of Catholic faith late in the 1 7th century. An oddly Hebe \n\nbminine symbolism was attached to this re-working of the heart-soul \n\nidea. Jesus\'s divinity was "the moon dwelling in the heart." His ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\niacred Heart was described by all the metaphors attached to the ancient \n\nllother-heart: "as \'the temple in which dwells the life of the world,\' \n\nb a rose, a cup, a treasure, a spring, as the furnace of divine love ... as a \n\njridal chamber." B \n\nThe church claimed that the Sacred Heart began with the divine \njision of St. Margaret Marie Alacoque in 1675. However, the idea \nlas not original with her. An alchemical textbook published 1 1 years \njefore her birth depicted the Sacred Heart encircled by a crown of \nhorns. Several centuries earlier, it was shown on a stained-glass window \nf the Convent des Cordeliers in Paris; on a Jacobin cloister wall; on \nJ window of the Chapel of St. Thomas Aquinas; and in four places of \nhe Carmelite church of St. Michael. Some of these "certainly \nelonged to the 1 5th and 16th centuries." H And of course, the concept \nf the divine heart-soul at the core of the living world that is, \nhiva\'s Sacred Heart, or Osiris\'s belonged to the millenia, long before \nhere was a Christian church. \n\n1 .

Greek myths said Hebe was cupbearer to the gods, \nispenser of their ambrosia of immortality. Without her, the gods would \nrow old and die, the same doom that threatened the Norse gods \n\'hen they lost Freya. 1 \n\nLike Eve, in her Mother aspect Hebe governed the Tree of Life \n\'ith its magic apples, source of the gods\' everlasting life, which they \nalously guarded from mankind (Genesis 3:22). Heroes like Heracles \nould become immortal gods by marrying Hebe and living in her \narden of paradise, where they could feed on the apples of the holy \nee. 2 Such myths show that Hebe was only Hera virginized, for Hera \ntas the owner of the serpent-guarded apple tree in the far-western \naradise, known to the Greeks as the garden of the Hesperides. \n\nAfter Hellenic Greeks introduced a social system of patriarchy and \nlie fashion of romantic-homosexual love, Father Zeus evicted Hebe \ntorn her traditional post and replaced her with his own male concubine, \nJanymede. Thus the Virgin Goddess was supplanted by the Youth, \npe gods\' new cupbearer, taken to heaven and dwelling in the stars as \npe constellation Aquarius. 5 \n\nl.Branston,249. 2.

Hecuba \n\n\n\nHecabe \n\nMatriarchal queen of Troy, embodying the spirit of the Moon- \ngoddess Hecate, whose name was the same as her own. Hecabe\'s \n"daughters" (priestesses) had divinatory powers, and the ability to cast \nspells, as shown by the legend of Cassandra. Hecabe herself laid \neffective curses. When captured by her enemies, she transformed \nherself into Hecate\'s totemic shape, a black bitch named Maera, Mara, \nor Moera, the Destroying Fate. 1 The wanderings of Odysseus were \nattributable to the curse of exile she laid on him; he was preserved from \ndeath only the by the counter-spell of his wife the Goddess Penelope. \n\n1. Graves, CM. 2, 342. \n\n\n\nHecate \n\nOne of the oldest Greek versions of the trinitarian Goddess, Hecate \nwas derived from the Egyptian midwife-goddess Heqit, Heket, or \nHekat, who in turn evolved from the heq or tribal matriarch of pre- \ndynastic Egypt: a wise-woman, in command of all the hekau or \n"mother\'s Words of Power." \' \n\nAs a heavenly midwife amalgamating the Seven Hathors of the \nbirth-chamber, Heqit delivered the sun god every morning. 2 Her \ntotem was the frog, symbol of the fetus; and this animal was still sacred \nto her four thousand years later when she became the Christians\' \n"queen of witches." \n\nIn Greece, Hecate was one of many names for the original \nfeminine trinity, ruling heaven, earth, and the underworld. Hellenes \ntended to emphasize her Crone or underworld aspect, but continued to \nworship her at places where three roads met, especially in rites of \nmagic, divination, or consultation with the dead. 3 Her images guarded \nthree-way crossroads for many centuries; thus she was Hecate Trevia, \n"Hecate of the Three Ways." Offerings were left at her roadside shrines \non nights of the full moon. As a deity of magic and prophecy she was \ninvoked by those who set out on journeys, like the biblical king of \nBabylon, who "stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ] \nways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with \nimages" (Ezekiel 21:21). \n\nHecate was called "most lovely one," a title of the moon. 4 Like all i \nother forms of the Triple Goddess, she was associated with the moon ] \nin all three of her aspects. Some said she was Hecate Selene, the Moon, \nin heaven; Artemis the Huntress on earth; and Persephone the \nDestroyer in the underworld. 5 Ancient texts referred to her as Hecate i \nSelene the Far-Shooting Moon, mother of Dionysus though Dio- \nnysus was also the son of Persephone, which shows that Hecate and \nPersephone were often confused with one another. 6 Sometimes \nHecate was considered identical with Diana Ilithyia, the Moon-goddess \\ \nas protectress of parturient women. Sometimes she was part of the \n\n\n\n378 \n\n\n\nDueen-of-Heaven trinity, Hebe the Virgin, Hera the Mother, Hecate \n[he Crone. Porphyry wrote: \n\nThe moon is Hecate, the symbol of her varying phases. . . . [HJer power \nappears in three forms, having as symbol of the new moon the figure in \nthe white robe and golden sandals, and torches lighted; the basket which \nshe bears when she has mounted high is the symbol of the cultivation of \nthe crops which she made to grow up according to the increase of her \nlight. 7 \n\nLate Hellenic writers devised a rather labored explanation for \nHecate\'s journey from the sky to the underworld, originally a mythic \nrietaphor for the moon\'s setting. Hecate was in the house of a \nwoman in childbirth. The gods, fearing magical contagion from this, \nllunged her into the river Acheron to wash away the traces of birth- \nnana. The river carried Hecate underground, where she married \nHades. This was a myth derived from patriarchal anxieties about \nlontact with childbearing women, demonstrated especially in the Bible \nJLeviticus 12:5). Ritual bathing of mother and child in a sacred river \nIfter the lying-in period probably gave rise to the story of Hecate\'s river- \nburney. \n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, Hecate became known as Queen \n\\{ the Ghostworld, or Queen of Witches. She was especially diabo- \nIzed by Catholic authorities who said the people most dangerous to the \npith were precisely those whom Hecate patronized: the midwives. 8 \nHer ancient threefold power was copied, however, by priestly writers \nl/ho reassigned it to their own deity: "The threefold power of Christ, \nlamely in Heaven, in earth, and in Hell." 9 \n\n1.

A king\'s virility was periodically tested, and when it \naned, he was usually killed and replaced. When King Fjolnir of \nweden "became impotent," he was drowned in a vat of mead, the \nDmmon euphemism for the sacred cauldron. 1 A similar custom \nisposed of biblical kings, like David, who died very soon after the \nlaiden Abishag proved him impotent (1 Kings 1:4). \n\n\n\n379 \n\n\n\nHeirmarmene j he Cerne Giant of Dorset was said to represent the Saxon god \n\ne Heill, personification of phallic spirit, as shown by his erect penis. \n\n^^^h The church claimed St. Augustine built Cerne Abbey to commemorate \nthe downfall of this lusty "devil," but it seems the shrine was dedi- \ncated to Heill in the first place, and simply taken over by Christian \nmonks. 2 \n\n1.

In Egyptian salva- \ntion-mysteries, rote learning of hekau was necessary to gain admission \nto various areas of the after-world. Also useful were amulets like the \nHekat, a uterine "ark" named after the Goddess. See Ship. \n\n\n\nHel \n\nNorse Queen of the Underworld, whose name became the English \n"hell." Dead heroes who went to the house of Hel were known as \nHelleder, "Hel\'s men." 3 Sometimes they were ancestral ghosts \nknown as Hella cunni, "kinsmen of Hel," corrupted in the medieval \nmystery play to Harlequin, lover of Columbine the Dove-maiden, \nwho was another version of the Goddess. 4 The Celtic Lord of Death, \nwearer of the apex or pointed tiara of divinity, bore the title of \nHelman. 5 \n\nThe early "hell" seems to have been a uterine shrine or sacred \ncave of rebirth, denoted by the Norse hellir. 6 The notion of Hel as a \ncauldron-womb filled with purgative fire may have been related to the \nidea of the volcanic Mother-mountain (Latin caldera). In the Pacific, \n\n\n\n380 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Hell or Mother Death was often a fire-mountain entered by \nway of a sacred cave. The Hawaiian volcano-goddess Pele, like Hel, \nkept souls of the dead in regenerative fire. Pele and Hel may have had \nlinguistic connections, as p and h may be interchanged in Indo- \nEuropean languages. In Malekula, the dead live in a volcano under the \nGoddess\'s rule: "Abiding in that fire is bliss; there is no fear of being \nconsumed." Japan\'s sacred volcano was named for the fire-goddess Fuji, \n"Grandmother" or "Ancestress." 7 Similarly, Hel was a fire-mountain \naccording to German legend; the emperor Theodoric became immortal \nby entering her womb through a volcano. 8 \n\nThe Infernus of classical paganism contributed to the Christian \namalgam of images of Hel\'s land. Infernus meant an oven in the \nearth; an old Roman proverb said "the oven is the mother." Roman \novens and bakeries were associated with temples of the Goddess, \nwhose harlot-priestesses were often called Ladies of Bread. Their orgies \nwere called Fornacalia, "oven-feasts," from fornix, the "oven" which \ngave us both "furnace" and "fornicate." 9 Naturally, Christian authori- \nties maintained that tasting the sacred fire of eternity through \n"fornication" was a sin. \n\nMedieval legends spoke of Hel as Brunnhilde, "Burning Hel," also \nthe name of a leader of the Valkyries, otherwise known as Hild the \nAvenger. 10 Another of her names was Matabrune, "Burning Mother," \nwho gave birth to King Oriant, a version of the Oriental sun god born \nat dawn from the bowels of the earth. 11 \n\nMagic fire surrounding the Valkyrie\'s castle was an allegory of \ncremation fire, through which a hero passed enroute to Hel. Crema- \ntion of the dead was later forbidden by the Christian church, on the \ntheory that cremation destroyed the body and prevented "resurrec- \ntion of the flesh" according to the orthodox dogma. The more practical \nreason for outlawing cremation was that, as a pagan ceremony, it \nbrought no revenue to the church. 12 It was profitable, however, to \ncremate witches while they still lived; inflated charges were made for \nevery rope, nail, and stick of wood. B \n\nSome myths suggest that Hel was originally envisioned as not fiery \nbut dark: a Crone-goddess like Black Kali, eater of the dead. As the \nNether Moon, she was called Nehellenia. Her ancient altars were found \nin Holland at the mouths of the Rhine. 14 Vases and statues from her \nshrines were discovered in Zealand in 1646. 15 Sometimes, her under- \nworld was not hot but ice cold, as if serving as a model for Dante\'s \ninnermost circle of the Inferno. The cold, dark Queen of Shades was \nNef-Hel or Nifl. \n\nHel was supreme and inescapable, seizing even gods in her \nembrace. The Swedes said Odin the Heavenly Father was buried in a \nbarrow known as Hel\'s Mount. 16 Because she was associated with \nmountains, Hel sometimes merged with Mother Freya. A fate- \nspinning Goddess called Hel of the Air was worshipped on the \nLuftelberg. 17 She was simultaneously diabolized as feminine counter- \npart of the Prince of the Power of the Air (Odin-Satan) who led the \n\n\n\nHel \n\n\n\nIn various dialects \nHel was Holle, Halja, \nHild, Helga, Holde, \nHelle, Ella, or Hellenia. \nHelgo, Heligoland, \nHelsinki, Hollingstedt, \nHolderness, \nHolstein, and Holland \nwere a few of the \nmany place names \nderived from her. \nShe was the usual tomb- \nwomb of rebirth after \ndeath. Iceland still has a \ntraditional "home of \nthe dead" in Helgafell \nor Hel\'s Hill. 1 In \nGermany, "Dame \nHolle\'s Well" was \ncalled the source of all \nthe children on \nearth. 2 \n\n\n\n381 \n\n\n\nHelen of Troy Wild Hunt. Tenth-century witchcraft texts said the heathen women \n\nrode forth under the leadership of "the witch Holda." 18 \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ Like her Greek twin Hecate, Hel sometimes wore all three faces oi \n\nthe Triple Goddess. The German poem Gudrun represented her as \nthe ruler of Holland, incarnate in three virgins living in a mystic cave: \nHild, princess of Isenland, Hilde, princess of India, and Hildburg, \nprincess of Portugal. All three resembled mermaids or wood nymphs. \nThe legendary Prince Hagen married all three Hels, after the usual \nritual combat with an elder king. 19 \n\nBallads and sagas depicting such encounters between mortal men \nand supernatural women were collectively described as "hellish" \nthat is, hellig, medieval Danish for "holy." 20 \n\nPliny said all the inhabitants of "Scatinavia" (Scandinavia) were \nchildren of Mother Hel, thus they were called Helleviones. 21 They \nconsidered their Goddess incarnate especially in elder trees, which were \nstill called Hel-trees or elven-trees in the Middle Ages. Danish \npeasants prayed at elder trees to the Hyldemoer, that is, Hel-mother, or \nElder-mother. 22 \n\nHel\'s ancient connection with fertility was still evident in her \nmedieval titles, Lady Abundia or Satia (abundance, satiety). In this \nguise she led the "ladies of the night" called Hellequins, who rode forth \nto receive offerings of food and drink from common folk, promising \nin return to bring prosperity on the house. 23 Apparently these were not \nmere legends but real women, carrying on the Goddess\'s nocturnal \nfestivals. Hel was despised by the church, but the common people seem \nto have thought her more benevolent than otherwise. Her under- \nworld was reached by crossing a river, like the Greek Styx; the river was \nGjoll, "Wailing." On the bridge that crossed it stood the Goddess\'s \nemanation, Modgudr (Good Mother), ready like the Orphic Perseph- \none to greet the deceased and see him safely into eternity. 24 \n\nNorthern shamans believed they could put on the Helkappe, a \nmagic mask or Hel-met, which would render them invisible like \nghosts, and enable them to visit the underworld and return to earth \nagain without dying. The Helkappe seems to have represented the \nshamanic trance, in which death and resurrection were experienced as a \nvision. See Mask. \n\nI. Turville-Petre, 55. 2. Rank, 73. 3. Steenstrup, 149. 4.

The ancients didn\'t view the underworld as primarily a place of \nlishment. It was dark, mysterious, and awesome, but not the vast \nire chamber Christians made of it. \n\nGreeks called the underworld Erebus, Hades, or Tartarus, from \n"tortoise" incarnation of Vishnu, who was supposed to support \n| earth in the form of a tortoise. Shades of the dead dwelling in \narus endured no torment other than the general cheerlessness of \nlg dead. Lacking blood, shadows, voices, and vital energy, they \nted yearningly for rebirth. \nLike the realms of earth and heaven, the underworld had its social \nlierarchy. Queen Persephone or Hecate, her consort Pluto or Hades, \nuled magistrates like Aeacus, Rhadamanthys, and Minos, who were \n\n\n\n\n\n\n383 \n\n\n\nHe " wizard-kings on earth. There were spirits like Hypnos (Sleep), \n\nMorpheus (Dreams), and Thanatos (Death). 1 Sometimes, as in the \n\nh^^^hh medieval vision of fairyland, the underworld was a place of sensual \n\ndelight. In the Elysian Fields, souls of the enlightened ones were tende \nby the Goddess\'s divine nymphs. \n\nLike the Egyptian nether god, Seker or Amen, Hades was "the \nunseen one" the ubiquitous Hidden God in his intra-uterine, \nsleeping, or dead Black Sun phase. Lord of the Underworld or Lord of \nDeath, he was also a phallic deity, holding the "key" to the nether \nyonic gate, as his heavenly counterpart Petra (Peter) held the key to th \nPearly Gate of Celestial Aphrodite. The nether god was supposed to \ndeposit his semen in rocks, where it solidified into precious gems, a \nwestern version of the Jewel in the Lotus. Thus he was Lord of \nRiches also. Romans called Hades by the name of Dis, short for Dives, \n"the rich god." 2 Most savior-gods who "harrowed hell," or plowed \nthe earth-womb, were credited with the power to reveal buried treasure \na power inherited by the Christian devil. 5 \n\nEgyptians called the underworld Amenti, Khert-Neter, Neter- \nKhertet, or the Tuat. It was both a hell and a paradise, a place of \njudgment and rebirth. Egyptian religion didn\'t emphasize punishment \nfor sin. Egypt\'s savior Osiris came to save humanity not from \neverlasting torture, but from death. 4 Egyptians feared death, which thej \ncalled an "abomination," and devoted most of their religious efforts \nto avoiding it. 5 \n\nEgyptian pictures of "the wicked" being destroyed in underworld \nfire-pits were interpreted by Christians as torments of damned souls. \' \nHowever, these "wicked" were not necessarily human. They were \nsupernatural enemies of the sun god: spirits of darkness, mist, storm. \nThe fire-pits seem to have represented the burning clouds of sunrise \nand sunset. Even when victims were human, their burning was not \neternal. \n\nEgyptians did not believe in purgatory or everlasting punishment. . . . \n[T]he wicked were slaughtered daily and their bodies consumed by fire, \nbut each day brought its own supply of these, and thus the avenging gods \nwere kept busy daily, and the fire-pits were filled with victims daily. \nThere is no evidence in the texts that the Egyptians thought the burning \nof the same victims could go on forever. 6 \n\nThe idea of eternal torture in hell arose with ascetic patriarchal \nreligions like that of Zoroastrian Persia. Masculine preoccupation with \npain stood in contrast to the matriarchies\' preoccupation with plea- \nsure, a psychic outgrowth of the severities of the ascetic life. There is \nreason to believe hell\'s nastier torments were invented primarily to \nintimidate women into obeying new patriarchal laws. \n\nZoroastrian priests insisted women who were unfaithful to their \nhusbands would go to hell and have their breasts torn open with iron \ncombs. Women who scolded would be forced to lick hot stoves with j \ntheir tongues. Women who showed disloyalty to men would be hung \nup by one leg, while scorpions, snakes, ants, and worms dug their way ir. \n\n\n\n384 \n\n\n\ni and out of their bodies. 7 A similar vision inspired Grunewald\'s Hell \n\n| medieval picture of the hellish torments in store for those who commit- \nted the crime of loving. 8 But not even the Persians supposed the ^^^^^-i^^-^_ \nItorments of hell would go on forever. That refinement of cruelty was \n(left to the Christians. \n\nThe Jews adopted the Persians\' hell as a place for punishing the \n(majority of women, judged hopelessly unworthy of the Father-god\'s \njheaven. Men could be consigned to hell for holding too much unneces- \nsary conversation with their wives, or for taking feminine advice. 9 \n(The female creation-river Gihon was converted into Gehenna, the \nJewish hell\'s river of fire, whose name was sometimes applied to the \niwhole land. The kingdom of Gehenna was 60 times as large as the \nworld. Each of its "palaces" had 6000 "houses," and each house had \npOOO vessels of fire and gall awaiting the sinner. Prince of Gehenna was \n(Arsiel, copied from the Chaldean "Black Sun" Aciel, the negative \ndeity corresponding to the god of light in the celestial realm. 10 \n\nJudeo-Christian tradition populated hell with all the biblical baalim, \neven those who had been identified with Yahweh himself: Behe- \nmoth, Leviathan, Baal-Peor, Baal-Zebub, Baal-Rimmon, Belial, \nKsmodeus, Molech, Lucifer, Satan, Tammuz, Dagon, Nehushtan, \nChemosh (Shamash), Apollyon: even Baal-Berith, the "God of the \n|3ovenant." These were joined by gods and goddesses of classical \nreligions: Hades, Pluto, Diana, Persephone, Hermes, Python, Hecate, \nMinerva, Venus, Cybele, Attis, Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn, Adonis, \nran, Lamia, Medusa, Lilith plus all the gods and goddesses of \nOermanic and Celtic paganism. Even those who were artificially \ncanonized, to convert their old shrines into churches, were often \n[ [imultaneously diabolized and consigned to hell in the guise of \nlemons. \n\nThere was a curious medieval passion for identifying, classifying, \npd naming all the demons. Sorcery required knowledge of their \n> lames and titles. An exorcist could do nothing until he learned the \n[jiame of the demon he dealt with. The Gospels said even Jesus \niieeded to learn the names of the Gadarene devils he exorcised (Mark \n|>:9). Thus, many sources provided lists of demonic names. \n\nOne of the most interesting dissertations on hell was Johann \n[Meyer\'s Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, published in the 16th cen- \nury when Weyer served the Duke of Cleves as a healer and diviner. \ni Weyer said there were exactly 7,405,926 demons, divided into 72 \nBompanies. These figures had already been reported in the Talmud. 11 \nMiupreme Chief of the Infernal Empire and founder of the Order of \n[he Fly was Beelzebuth (Baal-Zebub), the old Philistine Lord of Flies. \nI His lieutenants included Satan, Leader of the Opposition; Pluto, \nl*rince of Fire; Moloch, Prince of the Land of Tears and Grand Cross \nIf the Order of the Fly; Baal, Commander-in-Chief of the Infernal \nArmies and another Grand Cross of the Order of the Fly; and Lucifer, \nJ Lord Chief Justice of hell. \n\nBaal-Berith, erstwhile God of the Covenant, filled the post of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n385 \n\n\n\nHe" Minister of Treaties. Nergal, husband of the Babylonian under- \n\nground Goddess Eresh-kigal, became hell\'s Chief of Secret Police. Th \n^^^^^^^^^^h Royal Household included Melchom (Milcom) as Paymaster, and \n\nthe Philistine god Dagon as Grand Pantler. The Hebrew elephant god \nBehemoth (originally Ganesha, father of Buddha) was Grand Cup- \nBearer. Among the Masters of the Revels, Asmodeus held the post of \nSuperintendent of Casinos. Antichrist was only an insignificant jug- \ngler and mimic. 12 \n\nThe infernal hierarchy also maintained embassies in various Eurc \npean countries. Thamuz, or Tammuz, was Ambassador to Spain. \nBaal-Rimmon, Phoenicia\'s "Lord of the Pomegranate," was Ambassa- \ndor to Russia. England\'s ambassador was Mammon, whose \nappointment reflected continental resentment of the English zeal for \ncommerce. \n\nSexual prejudice also extended to the denizens of hell. There wa! \nonly one token female among hell\'s governing spirits: Proserpine, \ncalled Arch-she-devil and Sovereign Princess of Mischievous Spirits. \nAstaroth (Astarte) was present only in masculine disguise, as a "duke" \nof hell and its Grand Treasurer. The Goddess Belili took two male \nshapes, as Belial and Belphegor, hell\'s ambassadors to Turkey and \nFrance. \n\nMasculinized Goddesses appeared also in Collin de Plancy\'s \nDictionnaire infernal, an imitation of Weyer\'s Pseudomonarchia, \nshowing portraits of a male "demon Ashtoreth" and a male "demon \nEurynome." Even Lilith was masculinized as a hellish "prince" in \nAlexis de Terreneuve du Thym\'s list of devils: "Beelzebub, the su- \npreme chieftain; Satan, the dethroned prince; Eurinome, prince of \ndeath; Moloch, prince of the Land of Tears; Pluto, prince of fire; Pan, \nprince of the incubi; Lilith, prince of the succubae; Leonard, grand \nmaster of the Sabbaths; Daalberith (Baal Berith), high pontiff; and \nProserpine, the arch she-devil." 13 \n\nWhat Weyer\'s solemn imitators never understood was that the \nPseudomonarchia was really an elaborate joke, invented as a carica- \nture of earthly hierarchies. Humor and skepticism were equally foreign \nto the Age of Faith, when the core of learning was credulity. It was a \nchildlike age. Generations of would-be Magi soberly studied Weyer\'s \nmockery in search of demonic names to use in magic charms. \n\nWeyer not only mocked the Christian hierarchy; he also defendet \nwitches. As a physician, he was called to examine some of the \nInquisition\'s victims, and pronounced them harmless, deluded women \nwho could not be held responsible for the statements wrung from \nthem by torture. He tried unsuccessfully to halt the tortures and \nburnings. For this he was accused of heresy and indecency. Father \nBartolomeo da Spina scorned Weyer with heavy-handed irony: "Re- \ncently Satan went to a Sabbath attired as a great prince, and told the \nassembled witches they need not worry since, thanks to Weyer and his i \nfollowers, the affairs of the Devil were brilliantly progressing." H \n\n\n\n386 \n\n\n\nBut, Weyer aside, hell was not a joke. It was perhaps the most \nsadistic fantasy ever conceived by the mind of man. It was described, \npainted, and contemplated with incredibly perverse relish. Berthold of \nRegensburg said sinful folk must imagine their punishment in hell as \nthe pain of a body made white-hot in a white-hot universe. "Let them \ncount the sands of the sea-shore, or every hair that has grown upon \nman and beast since the days of Adam; let them reckon a year of \ntorment for each of those hairs and, even then, the sinner will be only \nat the outset of his unending agony." 15 Martin of Braga said anyone \nwho renounced Christianity would be "put physically into eternal fire \nin hell, where the inextinguishable flames burn for ever . . . and such a \nman shall long to die again, and not feel the punishment, but he will \nnot be allowed to." 16 \n\nChurchmen claimed the fires of sexual passion were transmuted \ninto the fires of hell, blown by the breath of God into a heat fiercer \nthan any earthly flame. A single drop of sweat from a damned soul \nwould pierce living flesh like an arrow and burn like acid. One was \ntold to imagine the pain of being covered with such sweat, forever. 17 \nThe story of sinner\'s sweat was often told throughout the Middle \nAges. It may have been inspired by a passage from the Mahabharata: \n"As the lord of gods, whose energy is infinite, became angry, a \nterrible drop of sweat came out of his forehead; and as soon as that drop \nof sweat had fallen to the earth, an enormous fire like the fire of \ndoomsday appeared." 18 \n\nPerhaps the worst part of the hell-vision was theologians\' insistence \nthat the joy of the blessed ones in heaven couldn\'t be complete unless \nthey were permitted to gloat over the sufferings of the damned. St. \nGregory the Great assumed with appalling naturalness that the "good" \npeople in heaven would be entirely without pity. St. Thomas Aquinas \nwrote: "In order that nothing may be wanting to the felicity of the \nblessed spirits in heaven, a perfect view is granted to them of the \ntortures of the damned." Other fathers of the church proclaimed that, \nwhile the greatest pleasure of the saved would be contemplating the \nDivine Essence, their second greatest pleasure would be watching the \ndamned writhing in hell. They couldn\'t feel sorry for loved ones or \nfriends in torment, because their opinions would always be identical \nwith God\'s; and God apparently reveled in sinners\' pain. 19 \n\nThomas of Cantimpre mentioned some "simple folk" who wor- \nried about having to watch former friends or relatives suffering in \nI hell. He said these worries were foolish, because no one in heaven could \ngrieve for anything. He cited the Blessed Marie d\'Oignies, who saw \nj in a vision that her dead mother was damned, and so stopped mourning \nfor her at once. 20 \n\nSt. Bernardino of Siena argued that heaven must be perfect, and \nperfection couldn\'t be achieved without "due admixture of groans \nfrom the Damned." Only a few people were good enough to be saved; \nthe vast majority would go to hell. This was the orthodox opinion. \n\n\n\nHell \n\n\n\nThomas of \nCantimpre 13th- \ncentury scholar and \nencyclopedist, author of \nOn the Nature of \nThings. \n\n\n\nSt. Bernardino of \n\nSiena (1380-1444) \nFranciscan \n\ntheologian, writer, and \nitinerant preacher, \ncanonized in 1450, six \nyears after his death. \n\n\n\n387 \n\n\n\nHell \n\n\n\nRaymond Lull \n\n(Raimundo Lulio) \nCatalan philosopher \nof the late 13th century, \nauthor of numerous \nmystical works in \nCatalan, Arabic, and \nLatin. Lull was revered \nin the Franciscan \norder as Doctor \nUluminatus and as a \nsaint in some areas. He \nwas never officially \ncanonized, though \nPope Pius IX \nconfirmed his cultus in \n1858. \n\n\n\nRaymond Lull was condemned as a heretic for trying to teach that \nChrist\'s mercy would save nearly all men. Christ was not that \nmerciful; only the mother Mary was that merciful. An Ethiopian \nChristian legend said Mary was distressed to see her kinfolk in \nhellfire, and asked God to give humanity holy writings that would save \nthem. 21 \n\nThe sadism implicit in the fantasy of hell was all too graphically \nenacted by the inquisitors\' tortures and burnings. The Inquisition\'s \nhandbook directed that "eternal damnation should begin in this life, tha \nit might be in some way shown what will be suffered in hell." 22 The \ninquisitor Bodin considered even slow burning a negligible punishment \nin view of its sequel: "Whatever punishment one can order against \nwitches by roasting and cooking them over a slow fire is not really very \nmuch, and not as bad as the torment which Satan has made for them \nin this world, to say nothing of the eternal agonies which are prepared \nfor them in hell, for the fire here cannot last more than an hour or so \nuntil the witches have died." 23 Of course, the witches so mercifully slain \noften had been subjected to unendurable tortures already for weeks, \nmonths, or even years. \n\nThe inquisitor Nicholas Remy said witches "are justly to be \nsubjected to every torture and to put to death in the flames; both that \nthey may expiate their crimes with a fitting punishment and that its \nvery awfulness may serve as an example and a warning to others." To \nhelp them remember the occasion, witches\' children were to be \nstripped and beaten with rods around the stakes where their mothers \nwere burning. 24 Inquisitors obviously disliked children. They burned \n"witches" 10 or 12 years of age, or even younger. 25 At Wiirzburg in \n1629, children as young as 7 were executed for witchcraft, plus many \nothers of 10, 12, 14, or 15 years. 26 \n\nUp to the 19th century, hell was used as a convenient way to \nthrow the "fear of God" into children. Father Furniss\'s Sight of Hell \npresented the following edifying fantasies to young people: \n\nOf two little maids of sixteen, one cared only for dress, and went to a \ndancing school, and dared to disport in the park on Sunday instead of \ngoing to mass: that little maid stands now, and forever will stand, with bare \nfeet upon a red-hot floor. The other walked through the streets at \nnight, and did very wicked things; now she utters shrieks of agony in a \nburning oven. A very severe torment immersion up to the neck in a \nboiling kettle agitates a boy who kept bad company, and was too idle to \ngo to mass, and a drunkard; avenging flames now issue from his ears. \nFor like indecencies, the blood of a girl, who went to the theatre, boils in \nher veins; you can hear it boil, and her marrow is seething in her bones \\ \nand her brain bubbles in her head. "Think, " says the compassionate \nfather, "what a headache that girl must have!" 27 \n\nDutch theologian Dirk Camphuysen opposed such crude train- j \ning of the young, on the theory that it was more disturbing to sensitive ( \nminds than corrective of sinful ones. Unable to refrain from commit- \n\n\n\n388 \n\n\n\nting some sins, people developed a personal conviction of doom, "which \nnecessarily produces such great fear and agony in the soul, that life is \ntoo frightening for them, and they find death by their own hand. Of this \nthere are not a few examples, and some of them known to me \npersonally. Others do not go as far as suicide, but fall into fits of \nmelancholy and despair, sometimes ending in madness." 28 \n\nJohn Wesley was so implacable as to maintain that the whole \nChristian religion depended entirely on the horrors of hell. If there \nwere "no unquenchable fire, no everlasting burnings," then all New \nTestament teaching is a lie, and there is no reason to believe in the \nrevelation of heaven. 29 Yet some theologians disagreed. Johann Clop- \npenburg said in 1682: "It is absurd that God should be angry forever, \nand punish the finite sins of creatures with infinite punishments." 30 \n\nSome thinkers maintained that only an evil God could create a hell \nso savage and deliberately allow human beings to fall into it, when he \nhad the power to prevent this. The doctrine of free will was invented by \nthe church to counteract this logic; but, as Bayle showed, "absolute \nfree will is of no real use in justifying hell or in theodicy in general." \nMan\'s free will "does not exculpate God from being ultimately \nresponsible for the sins He punishes, unless one takes from Him His \nomniscience as well as His omnipotence. . . . [I]f, before the creation, \nHe foresaw that most men would abuse their free will and commit sins, \nhe could have refrained from creating them." 31 The same sentiment \nwas put forth more than 2000 years ago by the author of 2 Esdras, who \ndemanded why God had bothered to create Adam if he couldn\'t \nrestrain Adam from sinning. \n\nIn wrestling with the problem of God\'s responsibility for hell, \ntheologians of the 17th and 18th centuries often found themselves \nforced by their own logic into a basically Manichean image of an evil \nGod. Sterry said "an angry, revengeful God is no God at all, but a \nprojection of men\'s evil passions. . . . If sin is part of God\'s plan, then \nthe sinner as much as the saint can claim to be fulfilling God\'s will." \nJurieu admitted "the absolute impossibility of reconciling God\'s hatred \nof sin with His permission of it." He re-phrased Esdras\'s question: "If \nGod has an infinite hatred of sin, why, having foreseen it, has He not \nprevented it? Why has He made men be born who, He well knew, \nwere to damn themselves? " Bayle described God as "a lawgiver who \nforbids man to commit crime, and who nevertheless pushes man into \ncrime, and then punishes him for it eternally." Thus he must be a God \n"in which one could have no trust, a deceiving, cunning, unjust, \ncruel nature; He is no longer an object of religion." 32 Whiston even \nconcluded that the very existence of hell must condemn God in the \neyes of humanity: \n\nThe exquisite torments of these most numerous and most miserable \ncreatures, are determined without the least pity, or relenting, or bowels \nof compassion in their Creator, to be in everlasting fire, and in the flames \nof Hell; without abatement, or remission, for endless ages of ages. And \n\n\n\nHell \n\n\n\nJohann Cloppenburg \n\n1 7th-century \ntheologian, author of \nthe Compendium \nSocinianismi \nConfutatum. \n\nPierre Bayle. 17th- \ncentury French \ntheologian of Calvin- \nist or pseudo-Calvinist \nbackground. \n\n\n\nSecond Book of \nEsdras (also known as \nthe Ezra Apocalypse) \nOne of the \napocryphal books \neliminated from the \nEnglish Bible but \nappearing as an \nappendix to the New \nTestament in the \nLatin Vulgate. \n\n\n\n389 \n\n\n\nHell all this for the sins of this short life; fallen into generally by the secret \n\nsnares of the Devil, and other violent temptations; which they com- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ monly could not wholly either prevent, or avoid . . . instances . . . of the \n\nabsolute and supreme power and dominion of the cruel and inexorable \nauthor of their being. n \n\nPolitical implications of the "problem" of hell were set forth by \nPetersen: \n\nWhat fruit has the doctrine of eternal damnation borne up till now? Has it \nmade men more pious? On the contrary, when they have properly \nconsidered the cruel, frightful disproportion between the punishments and \ntheir own finite sins, they have begun to believe nothing at all, and have \nthought that these books of Holy Scripture have just been compiled by the \npriests, who made up such threats for the common people as they \nthought fit, in order to keep them in check. 3 * \n\nOf course blaming the fiendishness of hell on God, or Satan, or \nAdam, or any other mythic figure was a way of avoiding recognition of \nthe fact that its real inventors were men. Eastern sages were more \nfrank; they said "the torments of hell are morbid creations of the \nindividual\'s own ideas." 55 The ideas of the individual, however, were \ncreated by the society in the case of hell, by the church. As Chaucer\'s \nSummoner slyly said, people sometimes thought the friars came by \ntheir familiarity with hell in a direct manner: \n\nThis friar boasts his knowledge about Hell, \nAnd if he does, God knows it\'s little wonder; \nFriars and fiends are seldom far asunder. J6 \n\nThough the possibility is seldom recognized, there are many \nindications that the Christian vision of hell in its sadistic horror was one \nof the leading causes of disillusionment with Christianity itself. Hell \nwas necessary, otherwise there was nothing for "salvation" to save from; \nyet it often seemed people were sent to hell for no greater sin than \nbeing human. William Blake said, "When thought is closed in caves, \nthen love shall show its root in deepest Hell." ?7 \n\nIn the end, scholars were forced to renounce hell because it made \nGod look more vindictive than man, though few dared admit that the \nvindictiveness sanctioned and stressed by the church was really man\'s \nalone. Shaftesbury said it was impossible to adore a God "whose \ncharacter is to be captious and of high resentment, subject to wrath and \nanger, furious, revengeful ... (of) a fraudulent disposition, encourag- \ning deceit and treachery among men, favorable to a few, though for \nslight causes, and cruel to the rest." Bayle found it impossible to \nexonerate "a good and omnipotent God" from responsibility for the \nworld\'s evils, though he made humanity suffer for them. The \nproblem became "infinitely more difficult when He has also to be \nexonerated from causing the suffering and wickedness of the next \nworld." 38 \n\n1. Larousse, 166. 2.

The death-dealing God- \ndess Anath was colored red with henna before immolation of human \nvictims to her image. 1 Gypsy legends preserved something of the \nassociation between henna and the sacrificial ceremonies of Mari- \nAnath. They claimed Mary was preparing to redden her hair with \nhenna at the very moment when her son was crucified; therefore she \nlaid a curse on the red pigment that was formerly sacred. 2 Jewish \nscriptures spoke of "daughters of Cain" i.e., women who didn\'t \nworship Yahweh whose hands and feet were "dyed with color" in \nthe Oriental fashion. 3 \n\nLike all other trappings of women\'s religions, henna was associated \nwith witchcraft in the Middle Ages. One of the heretical crimes for \nwhich the Spanish Inquisition arrested women was the use of henna to \nredden the skin or nails. 4 During the Victorian era, an Essex woman \nwas charged with witchcraft for no other reason than the discovery in \nher house of some "red ochre," or henna. 5 \n\n1.

Hephaestus was one of the \nancient Amazonian smiths, an opponent of the divine Father. He \ntook Hera\'s side in her quarrels with Zeus; he married Aphrodite; he \nwas on affectionate terms with the primal Sea-goddesses Thetis and \nEurynome; he shared a temple with Athene. He was lame, like all the \nAmazonian smiths. He was associated with volcanoes and lightning, \nlike all early gods who fertilized the Great Mother\'s "abyss" with fire. \nOne of Hephaestus\'s major shrines was the island of Lemnos, a \nmatriarchal colony founded by Amazons. 1 \n1. Graves, CM. 1,87-88. \n\n\n\n391 \n\n\n\nHera \n\n\n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and geographer \nof the 2nd century \na.d. Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the \nancient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nHera \n\nHera\'s name was sometimes rendered "Lady," and may have meant \nHe Era, the Earth. An earlier version was Rhea, the pre-Hellenic Great \nMother mythologized as the mother of the Greeks\' Hera. Both were \nforms of the Great Goddess of early Aegean civilization, who predated \nthe appearance of gods on the scene. 1 \n\nHera\'s name could also have been a cognate of Hiera, "Holy \nOne," a title of ancient goddess-queens who ruled in her name. An \nAmazon queen named Hiera of Mysia led her army against the Greeks \nin defense of matriarchal Troy. Philostratus said Homer refused to \nmention Hiera in the Iliad because she was so great as to outshine \nHomer\'s heroine, Helen. 2 \n\nThere were many other, more far-flung cognates and counterparts \nof Hera. In Babylon she was "Erua, the queen, who controls birth." 3 \nShe chose kings, gave them sovereignty by marrying them, and deposed \nthem. As the eponymous Goddess of ancient Ireland she was "the \nLady Eire," or Eriu. 4 Like Hera, the Lady Eire controlled the western \napple-garden of immortality. \n\nHera was the Mother of the Gods, even of the Olympian gods, to \nwhom she gave the ambrosia of eternal life. Hellenic writers tried to \nmake her subordinate to Zeus, though she was much older than he, and \nhad married him against her will. Their constant mythological quar- \nrels reflected conflicts between early patriarchal and matriarchal cults. \nAs the primordial feminine trinity, Hera appeared as Hebe, Hera, and \nHecate new moon, full moon, old moon otherwise personified as \nthe Virgin of spring, the Mother of summer, and the destroying \nCrone of autumn. Pausanias said Hera was worshipped as Child, Bride, \nand Widow. 5 In her Argive temple, she passed through endless cycles \nas her virginity was annually renewed, like that of Aphrodite, by \nimmersion in a holy spring. 6 \n\nHera received sacrifices of "heroes," or "Hera-sacred men," \nwhose myths dated from a primitive time when men were slain as her \nmartyr-bridegrooms. In ancient Greece the term "hero" was synony- \nmous with "ghost" one who had gone to the Goddess. 7 Herodotus \ntold the story of two of these heroes, Cleobis and Biton, chosen to draw \nthe Mother\'s chariot in a procession. Afterward they "fell asleep" in \nher temple and never woke again. This holy death reflected great honor \non their family; Solon called Cleobis and Biton "the happiest of \nmen." 8 Like Christian martyrs, they achieved the "crown." \n\nHera\'s cult spread at an early date throughout pagan Europe, the \nwhole continent having been named after one of her incarnations, \nEuropa. Saxons worshipped her at Heresburg (Hera\'s Mount), where \nthe phallic "column of the world" called Hermeseul was planted in \nthe Earth-goddess\'s yoni. 9 Late in the 8th century a.d., the temple was \ndestroyed and the phallic pillar overthrown by the armies of Charle- \nmagne. However, the sanctuary was not forgotten. The Salic Law \nreferred to "witches" called hereburgium or herburgium, those who \n\n\n\n392 \n\n\n\nworship at the Heresburg. 10 They were equated with those who \n"carried the cauldron" to religious meetings in honor of the God- \ndesssuch meetings as the clergy styled witches\' sabbats. Legends of \nHera\'s magic garden in the west, where the apples of immortality \ngrew, passed into the medieval lore of Fairyland. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,51. 2. Bachofen, 107. 3. Assyr. & Bab.

His Twelve Labors symbolized the sun\'s passage \nthrough the twelve houses of the zodiac, the heavenly "way" indicat- \ned for him by the same river of celestial milk. After his course was \nfinished, he was clothed in the scarlet robe of the sacred king and \nkilled, to be resurrected as his own divine father, to ascend to heaven, to \nmarry the virgin form of the Goddess all over again, and to dwell \namong the stars, where he is still found. \n\nPausanias said Heracles\'s surname was Soter (Savior). 1 Julian said \nof him, "All the elements obey the demiurgic and perfective power of \nthis pure and unmixed spirit, whom the great Zeus has begotten to be \nthe Savior of the Universe." He was worshipped everywhere as the \nsavior who "died" and rose again like the sun, which is why a solar \neclipse was supposed to have attended his death the same mythic \neclipse appended to the deaths of Krishna, Buddha, Osiris, and Jesus. 2 \n\nThe influence of Heracles\'s cult on early Christianity can hardly \nbe overestimated. St. Paul\'s home town of Tarsus regularly re- \nenacted the sacred drama of Heracles\'s death by fire, which is why Paul \nassumed there was great saving virtue in giving one\'s body to be \nburned, like the Heracles-martyrs (1 Corinthians 13:3). Heracles was \ncalled Prince of Peace, Sun of Righteousness, Light of the World. \nHe was the same sun greeted daily by Persians and Essenes with the \nritual phrase, "He is risen."\' The same formula announced Jesus\'s \nreturn from the underworld (Mark 16:6). \n\nHeracles also entered the underworld and "harrowed hell," the \nfructifying function of the King of Glory who "came in" to the \nwomb of the Earth-goddess (Hera). She gave him his second birth and \nmade him a god hence his title, dedicated to her glory. 4 He was \nsacrificed at the spring equinox (Easter), the New Year festival by the \nold reckoning. He was born at the winter solstice (Christmas), when \nthe sun reaches his nadir and the constellation of the Virgin rises in the \neast. 5 As Albert the Great put it centuries later, "The sign of the \n\n\n\nJulian (Flavius \nClaudius Julianus) \nRoman emperor \nfrom 361 to 363 a.d., the \nonly pagan to rule \nRome after the time of \nConstantine; \nnicknamed "the \nApostate" by \nChristian historians \nbecause he tried to \nre-institute the old \nRoman religion. His \ndeath was mysterious; \nsome claimed he was \nassassinated by a \nChristian. \n\n\n\n393 \n\n\n\nHeracles celestial virgin rises above the horizon, at the moment we find fixed for \n\nthe birth of our Lord Jesus Christ." 6 \n^ ^ _ The celestial virgin to whom Heracles ascended was sometimes \n\nHebe, or Hera-as-Maiden, or Eve as she was called in the Middle \nEast. Like Isis, she said the fruit of her womb became the sun. 7 Often \nshe was confused with Cyprian Aphrodite, who was really the same \ncelestial virgin incarnate in the attendant Horae who followed the god \nthrough his risings and settings on the wheel of time: "In twelve \nmonths the silent pacing Horae follow him from the nether-world to \nthat above, the dwelling of the Cyprian Goddess, and then he \ndeclines again to Acheron." 8 \n\nIn Lydia, Heracles was bound to the cosmic wheel of Queen \nOmphale, the Goddess incarnate, representing the hub of the universe \n(omphalos). He was one in a succession of her sacred kings. His \npredecessor was the oak-crowned Tmolus, who died by impalement \nafter coupling with the high priestess. Another earlier model of the \nwheel-kings was Ixion of the Lapiths, who died on a fiery wheel \nsignifying the revolutions of the sun. Such a sacrificial custom \nprobably underlay the myth of Heracles bound to the wheel and made \nto spin for a year that is, to turn through the signs of the zodiac \nwhich decorated the wheel. 9 Hellenic writers re-interpreted the myth to \nmean Heracles spent a year as a slave among Omphale\'s women, \nspinning flax on a spinning wheel, wearing female dress, a story \ninvented to explain the early stage in the evolution of sacred kingship \nwhen a man could be the queen\'s deputy only when wearing her \nrobes. 10 Priests of Heracles wore female garments up to a fairly late \ndate. \n\nAnother myth said Heracles\'s predecessor was the centaur Nessus, \nwho engaged in combat with Heracles for possession of the priestess \nDeianira. Heracles won, and married Deianira. Nessus died, bequeath- \ning his blood-red ceremonial robe to the conqueror. Later, when his \npriestess-wife ordained that he must wear the robe, Heracles put it on \nand burned as if "wrapped in flames." His pyre was lighted by the \nnext king, Philoctetes, who inherited his emblems of office. 11 \n\nAn Egyptian version of the same dying-and-reborn "hero" was \nHorus, or Heru, firstborn of Isis-Hathor. 12 In his dying aspect he was \nthe enfeebled form of Ra, named Harakhti, declining toward his \nburning pyre in the west, to be devoured by the Mother\'s under- \nground womb. Greeks called his holy city Herakleopolis, "City of \nHeracles." n The same sun-and-fire god was known in the Far East \nas one of the Ten Knowledge-Holding Deities, still remembered as "the \nmost Supreme Heruka." H \n\nEgypt continued to celebrate the fiery death and rebirth of a mock \nking up to the 19th century a.d., on the first day of each year by \nCoptic reckoning. The god-man was placed on a throne for three days, \ncrowned with a tall pointed miter like that of pharaohs, May Kings, \nCarnival Kings, Lords of Misrule, and other pagan savior figures. Then \n\n\n\n394 \n\n\n\nI he was burned in effigy and crept forth "reborn" from the ashes of his \n\nroyal garment. Frazer says, "The custom points to an old practice of \nI burning a real king in grim earnest." 15 According to Tertullian, as \n\nlate as the 3rd century a.d. the people of Carthage were still annually \nburning "men who were gods of light." 16 \n\nHaving died a martyr\'s death, Heracles ascended to heaven with- \n! out delay and received a place on the right hand of the Crone, or \n\nCrown Corona Borealis, the constellation of the martyr\'s reward. \ni\\ Christian martyrs were promised the same "crown" in heaven. \nj Meanwhile, Heracles\'s reward on earth was claimed by Christian \n\npriests: that is, tithes, from the Roman military custom of donating to \nI Heracles\'s temple a tenth part of the spoils of victory. 17 \n\nAs another underworld Lord of Death, Heracles was credited with \n1 the same power to reveal buried treasure that was later inherited by \n\nthe Christian devil. 18 \n\n1.

He was really older than \nGreece, one of the Aegean Great Mother\'s primal serpent-consorts, \n[partaking of her wisdom because he was once a part of her. Like India\'s \nArdhanarisvara Kali and Shiva united in one body Hermes was \nthe original "hermaphrodite" united in one body with Aphrodite. \nPriests of Hermes wore artificial breasts and female garments to \npreside over Aphrodite\'s Cyprian temple in the guise of the god \n[Hermaphroditus. 1 \n\nHermes was a universal Indo-European god. An Enlightened One \nborn of the virgin Maia, he was the same as the Enlightened One \n(Buddha) born of the same virgin Maya in India. The Mahanirvanatan- \ntra said Buddha was the same as Mercury (Hermes), the son of the \nMoon (Maya). 2 \n\nGreeks called Hermes the Psychopomp, Conductor of Souls, the \nsame title everywhere given to the Lord of Death in his union with \nthe Lady of Life. Hermes had greater power over rebirth and reincarna- \ntion than the heavenly father Zeus. It was Hermes who transferred \nDionysus from the womb of the Moon-goddess to Zeus\'s "thigh" \n(penis) so he could be born from a male; apparently Zeus couldn\'t \naccomplish this miracle for himself.* \n\nHis feminine wisdom credited Hermes with the invention of \ncivilized arts usually attributed to the Goddess: measuring and weigh- \ning, astronomy and astrology, music, divination by knucklebones. He \n\n\n\n\n\n\n395 \n\n\n\nHermes helped the three Fates compose the alphabet. 4 He could control the \n\nelements. His caduceus could transform whatever it touched into gold, \nn^H^^Hi^ which is why Hermes became the patron of alchemists. 5 \n\nOvid said Hermes was married to the lunar priestess of a sacred \nfountain in Caria, the Land of the Goddess Car. He was also part of a \ntrinity with Mother Earth and Father Hades, and a phallic god of the \norgiastic Cabiri who worshipped Demeter Cabiria in the Mysteries of \nPhrygia and Samothrace. 6 \n\nHermes\'s phallic spirit protected crossroads throughout the Greco- \nRoman world, in the form of herms, which were either stone phalli or \nshort pillars with Hermes\'s head at the top and an erect penis on the \nfront. During the Christian era, the herms were replaced by roadside \ncrosses, but the idea of setting these votive erections at crossroads was \npagan rather than Christian. \n\nSaxons worshipped Hermes as the phallic spirit of the Hermeseul, \nor Irminsul, planted in the earth at the Mother-mount of Heresburg \n(Hera\'s Mount). It is now known as Eresburg, and a church of St. Petei \nstands where Hermes\'s ancient sanctuary united the phallic principle \nwith Mother Earth. Other Germanic tribes worshipped Hermes under \nthe name of Thot or Teutatis, "Father of Teutons." 7 Hermes- \nMercury was the same as the Germanic father-god Woden, which is \nwhy the Hermetic day, Wednesday, is Woden\'s Day in English but \nMercury\'s Day in Latin languages. \n\nThe Cross of Woden also represented Hermes as "the only \nfourfold god." The sign of the cross traced by Christians on their \nheads and breasts originated as one of the crosses of Hermes, the Arabic \nnumeral 4, often appearing upside down or backward as the Chris- \ntians\' gesture drew it. 8 The medieval legend that witches made the sign \nof the cross upside down or backward may have begun with worship- \npers of Hermes; actually, Christians had reversed the cross-sign made by \nthe pagans instead of vice versa. \n\nThe cross marked Hermes a god of four-way crossroads, the four \nquarters of the earth, the four elements, the four divisions of the \nsacred year, the four winds, and the solstices and equinoxes represented \nby their zodiacal totems Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius the \nbull, lion, serpent, and man-angel symbols adopted by Christians to \nrepresent the four evangelists. 9 Sometimes, the cross of Hermes was \nan ankh, standing on a crescent that signified his mother the moon. This \n\nevolved into the conventional sign of Mercury, a circle with a cross \n\nSign of Mercury (Hermes) below and a crescent above. 10 \n\nHermes was also represented by the Gnostic "world" sign, a \nMaltese cross with a circle at the end of each arm. 11 This seems to \nhave referred to the four solstitial and equinoctial suns. Gnostics viewed \nHermes as a personification of the World Serpent, ruler of time, who \ncoiled around the terrestrial egg. 12 According to Gnostic Gospels, Jesus i \ntold Mary that the serpent surrounded the world, with his tail in his \nmouth, his body containing the twelve zodiacal halls that is, he was \n\n\n\n396 \n\n\n\n\nidentified with the Egyptian Tuat (Thoth) and the druidic ouroboros, \n\nalso known as the Wise Serpent Hermes. 13 \n\nNeoplatonic philosophers called Hermes the Logos, or Word of \n| God made flesh. 14 Christian images of Jesus as the Logos were \n| borrowed from the older deity, whose hymns addressed him in terms \nI similar to those used in the Gospels: \n\nLord of Creation, the All and One. . . .He is the light of my spirit; his be \nthe blessing of my powers. . . . Hymn, O Truth, the Truth, O Good- \nness, the Good, Life, and Light, from you comes as to you returns our \nthanksgiving. I give thee thanks O Father, thou potency of my powers; \nI give thee thanks O God, the power of my potencies. Thine own Word \nthrough me hymns thee. . . . Thou pleroma in us, O Life, save us; O \nLight, enlighten us; O God, make us spiritual. The Spirit guards thy \nWord. . . . From the Eternal I received blessing and what I seek. By thy \nwill have I found rest. 1S \n\nNaturally, Hermes became the "god within" sought by all \nreligious philosophers of the Gnostic period. (See Antinomianism.) \nHis traditional bisexuality was interpreted as self-love; some said he \ninvented the ritual of self-love, that is, masturbation. His caduceus was \njcalled a masturbatory symbol, a rod massaged by the serpents that \nembraced it. 16 Masturbation was said to be the hermit\'s typical act of \nself-contemplation, which some claimed would lead to comprehen- \nision of the God, just as sexual intercourse led to comprehension of the \nilGoddess. A "herm-e\\" was literally a little Hermes, with a divine \nI spirit dwelling in the phallus. \n\nHermes lived on through the Middle Ages in a new disguise as \nHermes Trismegistus, Hermes the Thrice-Great One, founder of \n(systems of Hermetic magic, astrology, alchemy, and other blends of \n[mysticism with natural science. Lazzarelli\'s Calix Christi et Crater \niHermetis (Chalice of Christ and Cup of Hermes) said all learning came \nfrom Hermes, who gave it to Moses in Egypt. Agrippa von Nette- \nj >heim often cited the authority of Hermes, whom he took for a \nU\'randson of Abraham. Burton\'s Anatomy of Melancholy listed Her- \nInes as one of the great philosophers, along with Socrates, Plato, \nPlotinus, Seneca, Epictetus, the Magi, and the druids. 17 A 16th- \ncentury treatise said the Hermetic vessel was "a uterus for the spiritual \nrenewal or rebirth of the individual . . . more to be sought than \nIcripture." 18 \n\nHermetic magic was extensively cultivated by the Arabs, who \nbased much of their numerical and alchemical systems on Hermetic \nlore. 19 Sufi mystics and eastern alchemists both claimed Hermes as an \nInitiate of their craft. 20 After the crusades, Europeans developed a new \nninterest in what they regarded as the ancient wisdom of the east, and \n[became greatly impressed by any philosophy attributable to classical \nlantiquity. \n\nAbout 1460 a Greek manuscript of the eastern Corpus Hermeti- \nfum was presented to Cosimo de\' Medici by a monk named \n\n\n\nHermes \n\n\n\n397 \n\n\n\nHermes \n\n\n\nSir Thomas \n\nBrowne (1605-1682) \nEnglish physician, \nauthor of the famous \nReligio Medici and \nother works. \n\n\n\nLeonardo da Pistoia. Other texts were added later to the growing body \nof semi-secret "devilish arts" which commanded more and more of \nthe attention of European intellectuals. Sir Thomas Browne called \nHermetism "the mystical method of Moses bred up in the Hiero- \nglyphical Schools of the Egyptians," stating that the Egyptians \nworshipped Hermes as Mercurius or Anubis, "the Scribe of Saturn, \nand Counsellor of Osiris, the great inventor of their religious rites, and \nPromoter of good unto Egypt." Hermes ascended to heaven in the \nform of Sirius, the Great Dog. He was so revered in Italy that the \nmosaics of Siena Cathedral portrayed him with the inscription, \n"Hermes Mercury Trismegistus, Contemporary of Moses." 21 \n\nThe Christian mythological figure most often assimilated to Her- \nmes was the archangel Michael, Angel of Death, with a function \nresembling that of the ancient Psychopomp. "On the ruins of ancient \ntemples of Mercury, built generally on a hill, rose chapels dedicated \nto St. Michael." A hill formerly sacred to Hermes-Mercury in France \nstill bears the name of Saint Michael-Mont-Mercure. It lies opposite \nanother "Michael\'s Mount" located across the channel in England. 22 \n\nSpirits of the two mounts were both called Mercurius in pre- \nChristian times, perhaps representing the twin serpents that expressed \nHermes\'s dual function as lord of death and rebirth. The twin serpents \nhad many incarnations in alchemy and magic. Of them Flamel \nwrote: "These are snakes and dragons, which the ancient Egyptians \npainted in the form of a circle, each biting the other\'s tail, in order to \nteach that they spring of and from one thing. These are dragons that the \nold poets represent as guarding sleeplessly the golden apples of the \nHesperian maidens. . . . These are the two serpents that are fastened \naround the herald\'s staff and the rod of Mercury." 25 \n\nHermetic mysticism usually called the serpents male and female, \n\nfor the real secret of Hermetic power was androgyny. Like that of \n\nOriental gods, Hermes\'s efficacy depended on his union with the \n\nfemale soul of the world, like the Aphrodite of his archaic duality. In \n\nmedieval texts she was called the Anima Mercury, a naked woman \n\nsurrounded by oval mandorla designs like the World card of the \n\nTarot pack. 24 This card was the last of the Tarot trumps, and the \n\nMagician, identified with Hermes, was the first numbered trump. A \n\nMantegna Tarot showed the Magician as a classic Mercury with \n\nserpent-twined caduceus, winged helmet, and flute, stepping over a \n\nsevered head symbol of oracles toward a cock, the symbol of \n\nannunciation. 25 \n\n1.

The \nGospel story says Herodias demanded the head of John the Baptist and \nhad her dancing daughter obtain it from Herod. This made her a \nprime religious villainess, and about the 10th century a.d. her name \nbegan to be taken as a synonym for Hecate, Queen of Witches. Yet \nthe classic belief that Hecate was that third of the Triple Goddess who \nruled the underworld, while her other personae Hebe and Hera ruled \nheaven and earth, came to be applied to Herodias as the new Hecate. In \n936 a bishop of Verona formally denounced "those who believe that \nHerodias rules one-third of the world." ! \n1. J.B.Russell, 75. \n\n\n\nHesione \n\n"Queen of Asia," a Syrian title of Atargatis, or Meri-Yamm, the \nGreat Goddess of the sea in conjunction with her serpent. Greeks \nclaimed Hesione was rescued from a sea serpent by Heracles, another \nversion of the Perseus-Andromeda myth. The original fight probably \nwas the one between Baal and the sea serpent Yamm for the sexual \nfavors of the Asian Goddess. (See Kingship.) \n\n\n\nHesperides \n\nGarden of immortality in the Far West, belonging to Mother Hera \nwho sometimes took the form of Hespera, the Evening Star (Venus). \nApples of eternal life grew on the Hesperian apple tree, guarded by \nHera\'s sacred serpent. Like most versions of the earthly paradise or \nEden, this one was located beyond the Pillars of Heracles (Gibraltar). \n\n\n\n399 \n\n\n\nHestia The Pillars were not only the straits leading to the western sea, but also \n\nHex the phallic shafts that stood in front of the ancient temples, the \n\nl ^^^ mt ^ ammmmamm Garden being the temple itself, symbol of Hera\'s regenerative womb. \n\n\n\nHestia \n\nGreek "Hearth," one of the oldest matriarchal Goddesses, in Latin, \nVesta. She represented the home place, every man\'s "center of the \nworld." When the matriarchs ruled, "The hearth was in the midst of \nthe dwelling; that hearth was to each member of the household, as it \nwere, an umbilicum orbis, or navel of the earth . . . [h]earth being \nonly another form of earth, as in the German erde and herde." \nPythagoras said the fire of Hestia was the center of the earth. 1 \n\nRomans had the same idea about the altar of Vesta, with its \nperpetual fire tended by the mystic Vestal Virgins. Cicero said the \npower of Vesta extends over all altars and hearths, therefore all prayers \nand offerings begin and end with her, "because she is the guardian of \nthe innermost things." 2 \n\nHestia never had a consort, for no god could share her strictly \nmatriarchal province, the Prytaneum or public hearth of every town. \nIt was said of her that "seated in the midst of the celestial dwelling-place \nshe receives the richest part of sacrifices, and among men she is of all \nthe deities the most venerated." i \n\n1.

Unlike wives, they were free to \nattend schools, establish salons, and take a vital part in social and \nintellectual life of the time. \n\nTheir title may have been related to Egyptian heter, "friendship,\' \nwhose hieroglyphic sign was two women grasping each other\'s \nhands. 1 \n\n1. Budge, E.L., 51. \n\n\n\nHex \n\nThis word for a witch\'s spell had a long history associated with \nconnotations of the number six Greek hex, Latin sex, cognate with \nEgyptian sexen, "to embrace, to copulate." Six was everywhere the \n\n\n\n400 \n\n\n\nI number of sex, representing the union between the Triple Goddess and Hexagram \n\nI her trident-bearing consort, which is why Christian authorities called \n\nsix "the number of sin." \' Pythagoreans on the contrary called six the ^^_^^_^_^_ \n\nperfect number, or The Mother. One of its Egyptian forms seshemu, \nj "sexual intercourse" shown in hieroglyphics by male and female \nj genitals in conjunction survived in the Sufi love-charm designed to \n\niopen the "cave" of the Goddess: Open, Sesame. 2 \nTo this day, hex signs are hexagonal like the six-pointed Tantric \n, yantra of love (see Hexagram). The name of the sign is from \nGerman Hexen, "witches," who may have been so named because they \n"made the six." \n\nA triple six, 666, was the magic number of Triple Aphrodite (or \nIshtar) in the guise of the Fates. The Book of Revelation called it \n"the number of the Beast" (Revelation 13:18), apparently the Beast \nwith Two Backs, the androgyne of carnal love. Solomon the wizard- \nking made a sacred marriage with the Goddess and acquired a mystic \n666 talents of gold (1 Kings 10:14). Christians usually called it \nSatan\'s number, yet the recurrences of this number in esoteric traditions \nare often surprising. For example, the maze at Chartres Cathedral \nwas planned so as to be exactly 666 feet long. 5 \n\nEgyptians considered 3, 6, and 7 the most sacred numbers. Three \nstood for the Triple Goddess; six meant her union with the God; \nseven meant the Seven Hathors, seven planetary spheres, seven-gated \nholy city, seven-year reigns of kings, etc. Egyptians had an abiding \nconviction that the total number of all deities must be exactly 37, \nbecause of this number\'s magic properties. Not only did it combine \nthe sacred 3 and 7, but 37 multiplied by any multiple of 3 gave a triple \ndigit or "trinity": 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, etc. The miraculous \nnumber 666 is a product of 3 X 6 X 37. 4 \n\n1.

Actually, the \n\nhexagram had nothing to do with either David or Solomon. It was \n\nnot mentioned in Jewish literature until the 12th century a.d., and was \n\nnot adopted as a Jewish emblem until the 17th century. 1 Hexagram \n\nThe real history of the hexagram began with Tantric Hinduism, \nwhere it represented union of the sexes. 2 The downward-pointing \ntriangle was the Female Primordial Image or Yoni Yantra, existing \nfore the universe. In the course of infinite time, the Goddess \nnceived a spark of life within her triangle, the bindu, which was \n\n\n\n# \n\n\n\n401 \n\n\n\nHexagram eventually born and developed into a male, symbolized by the \n\nupward-pointing triangle. He united with his Mother to form the Primal \n\n^^h^^^^^mhm Androgyne. 3 The sign of this union was the hexagram, called Sri \n\nYantra or Great Yantra. "The downward-pointing triangle is a female \nsymbol corresponding to the yoni; it is called \'shakti.\' The upward- \npointing triangle is the male, the lingam, and is called \'the fire\' \n(vahni)." 4 \n\nA personification of the Great Yantra was Bindumati, "Mother of \nthe Bindu," described in myth as a divine harlot. She ruled the forces \nof nature. She could command storms by the power of her magic and \nhalt rivers in their tracks, a miracle copied by several holy men in \nEgyptian myth, and later by Moses. \n\nFrom the Tantric image of the sexual hexagram arose a Jewish \nsystem of sex worship connected with the medieval Cabala, and a \nrabbinical tradition that "a picture is supposed to be placed in the ark of \nthe covenant alongside of the tables of the laws, which shows a man \nand a woman in intimate embrace, in the form of a hexagram." 5 \n\nThe Cabala was developed by the Jews of Moorish Spain after the \ncrusades brought eastern Goddess worship into their ken. Cabalists \nused the hexagram as Tantric yogis used it, to represent the union of \nGod with his Female Power, Shekina, the Jewish form of Shakti-Kali. \nAs Shakti was the essential soul of any Hindu god, so Shekina was the \nessential soul of the Cabalistic God. As in all religions of the Divine \nMarriage, Cabalistic Judaism discovered man and woman to be earthly \nimages of God and Goddess; and sexual union of mortals naturally \nencouraged its like in the supernatural realm. Therefore sexual inter- \ncourse was "a sacramental act in the service of a God and his consort \n(or perhaps vice versa: a Goddess and her consort)." 6 \n\nThe Zohar identified Shekina with Torah, "the law," as the older \nGnostic Goddess was identified with her own virgin form Maat, "the \nlaw" or "Truth." A man aspiring to mystic wisdom had to become a \n"bridegroom of Torah," for the law was embodied in a maiden, like \nthe enlightening lady-love of contemporary bardic romance, which was \nalso inspired by eastern Goddess-worship. \n\nFor the Torah resembles a beautiful and stately damsel, who is hidden in a \nsecluded chamber of her palace. . . . She opens the door of her hidden \nchamber ever so little, and for a moment reveals her face to her lover, but \nhides it again forthwith. . . . He alone sees it and he is drawn to her with \nhis heart and soul and his whole being. . . . When he comes to her, she \nbegins from behind a curtain to speak words in keeping with his \nunderstanding, until very slowly insight comes to him. 7 \n\nThe hexagram stood for the complete union of the sage with \nShekina-Torah. Attribution of the hexagram to Solomon as the magic \n"Solomon\'s Seal" probably arose from the popular view of Solomon, \n\n\n\n402 \n\n\n\ns enlightened by a sacred marriage, suggested by the erotic love poetry Hierophant \n\nIf Solomon\'s Song in the Bible. \n\n\n\nI.

The Great Hind she personified was Kore- \nDiana, Mother of Animals, ancestral Goddess of her tribe. \n\n\n\nHippolytus, Saint \n\nOne of the pseudo-saints, based on a pagan god worshipped in both \nGreece and Rome as a dying-and-resurrected savior. Originally he died \nas a surrogate for King Theseus, who retained his throne by sacrific- \ning "sons" who received the title of Hippolytus, "Torn by Horses." The \nmanner of sacrifice was that the victim was dragged to death by \nchariot horses, a rite apparently initiated in Athens by Theseus\'s Cretan \nqueen, Phaedra. Myth says Hippolytus\'s horses were frightened into \ntheir fatal stampede by a Bull from the Sea, actually a title of the Cretan \nhigh priest whose totemic form was the Minotaur. \n\nHippolytus was called the son of the Amazon queen, who embod- \nied the spirit of Artemis-Diana. The Roman Hippolytus was slain and \nresurrected in Diana\'s sacred grove of Nemi. He was apotheosized and \nraised to heaven as the constellation Auriga, the Charioteer. 1 He \nmarried the Goddess\'s virgin aspect, the nymph Egeria. He was reborn \nlike all cyclic gods as his own son, Virbius, "the Virile One." Virbius \ntoo was slain by horses in his turn. \n\n"We can hardly doubt," says Frazer, "that the Saint Hippolytus of \nthe Roman Calendar, who was dragged by horses to death on the \nthirteenth of August, Diana\'s own day, is no other than the Greek hero \nof the same name, who, after dying twice over as a heathen sinner, \nhas been happily resuscitated as a Christian saint." 2 \n\nA number of theological writings were brought forth under the \nsignature of St. Hippolytus, whose "life" was assigned to the 3rd \ncentury a.d. The likelihood is that all these works were forged at a later 1 \ndate and arbitrarily given a canonical authorship, as was the custom of \nthe early church. 3 \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1, 358. 2.

A commentator on the Upanishads Hocus Pocus \n\nsaid any god may be called Hiranyagarbha "when associated with the Hokmah \n\npower called Maya the power to evolve the empirical universe." 1 ^^^^__^^^_ \n\nThis effectively withholds the information that "the power called \nMaya" is the Great Goddess, and the "association" between her and the \ngod is that of mother and child.

Some myths say Hod was really another name for Odin, who \nwas blind or half-blind; for Odin contrived the death of his divine son \nBalder, much as Yahweh contrived that of his divine son Jesus. \nChristians claimed Jesus was pierced by a spear wielded by a blind man, \nSt. Longinus. Probably Hod was a title of the high priest in charge of \nsacrificial killings, embodying Odin\'s spirit. 1 He may even have been \nblindfolded or put into an eyeless mask, the Helmet of Darkness \n(Tarnhelm), to enact the sacred drama as a deadly game of Blind Man\'s \nBuff. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 113-18. \n\n\n\nHofgydja \n\n"Priestess of the Temple," Norse title of clan mothers who had \ncharge of religious rites up to the 1 1th century a.d., when Christian \nmissionaries began to oust women from their shrines. 1 Women \ncarried on their traditional festivals in private, as "witches." \n\nl.Turville-Petre. 261. \n\n\n\nHokmah \n\n\'Wisdom," the Hebrew version of the Gnostic Goddess known in \nLatin as Sapientia, in Greek as Sophia. Her name was only a title of the \nGreat Mother who actively helped God create the world, according \n\n\n\n\n\n\n405 \n\n\n\nHolly to Proverbs 8, and whose symbol was the Aphroditean dove later \n\nadopted by Christians as a sign of the Holy Ghost. Much of the \n\nm mmm m |^ mm Jewish "Wisdom literature" owed its origin to ancient Oriental and \nEgyptian sources in which the Goddess was supposed to have \ninspired clear thinking on all matters of morality and religion. 1 There- \nfore Hokmah closely resembled Isis. Her praises were inserted into \nthe mouth of Solomon, one of her most renowned lovers, by the author \nof the Wisdom of Solomon: \n\nHer bright shining is never laid to sleep. But with her there came to me all \ngood things together. . . . And I rejoiced over them all because [Hok- \nmah] leadeth them; though I knew not that she was the mother of them. . . . \nShe that is the artificer of all things . . . there is in her a spirit quick of \nunderstanding, holy, alone in kind, manifold, subtle, freely moving . . . all- \npowerful, all-surveying, and penetrating through all spirits. . . . Yea, she \npervadeth and penetrateth all things. . . . And she, though but one, hath \npower to do all things; and remaining in herself, reneweth all things. . . . \nFor she is fairer than the sun, and above all the constellations of the stars; \nbeing compared with light, she is found to be before it. . . . She \nreacheth out from one end of the world to the other with full strength, and \nordereth all things well. 2 \n\nIt may be that the Hebrew name of Hokmah was also of \nEgyptian origin, after an ancient title of Isis as Heq-Maa, Mother of \nMagical Knowledge, dating back to the heq or tribal wise-woman of \npre-dynastic times. The Goddess as Heqit, Hekat, and the Greek \nderivative Hecate (the Wise Crone) can be traced to the same \nsources. \n\n1. Encyc. Brit, "Wisdom Literature." 2. Barrett, 143, 218-19. \n\n\n\nHolly \n\nTo the druids, holly was the plant of death and regeneration, sacred \nto Mother Holle, or Hel, the underworld Goddess. 1 Germanic witches \nwho worshipped her favored holly wood for magic wands. Red holly \nberries showed the female blood-of-life color, corresponding to white \nmistletoe berries associated with male elements of semen and death. \nIn the divine marriage celebrated at Yule, they were displayed together. \n\nThe "holy" holly was linguistically linked with Hel\'s yonic "hole" \n(Germanic Hohle, a cave or grave). It was the most sacred of trees, \naccording to a carol sung by medieval pagans at Yuletide, saying holly \n"bears the crown." 2 \n\nIn the Dionysian cult, female holly was paired with the god\'s male \nsymbol, ivy. ? Green boughs of both were used to adorn doorways at \nthe solstitial festival. Tertullian condemned the custom, saying any \nChristian who has "renounced temples" should not make a temple of \nhis own house door. 4 Nevertheless, house-decorating with holly, ivy, or \nmistletoe at the solstitial festival went serenely on. The Council of \n\n\n\n406 \n\n\n\nBracara ruled that no Christian should bring holly into his house for \nChristmas, because it was a custom of "heathen people." 5 Heathen \njor not, it was inextricably linked with Yuletide celebrations and could \nnot be eradicated. \n\nEven the sexual symbolism of the holly was remembered, in a way, \nup to the 17th century. Christmas games included a mock battle of \nthe sexes, in which the master and mistress of the house engaged: \n"Great is the contention of holly and ivy, whether master or dame \nwears the breeches." 6 The kiss under the mistletoe originally represent- \ned sexual union, a peaceful resolution of the battle. \n\n1.

In Asia \nMinor from 3500 to 1750 b.c. the dead were embalmed in honey \nand placed in fetal position in burial vases or pithoi, ready for rebirth. \n\'To fall into a jar of honey" became a common metaphor for "to \nlie." \' The pithos represented the womb of the Goddess under her \nlame of Pandora, "All-giver," and honey became her sacred essence. \n\nMyths present many symbolic assurances that the Goddess would \nestore life to the dead through her magic "bee-balm." Worshippers \n)f Demeter called her "the pure mother bee," and at her Thesmo- \nDhoria festivals displayed honey-cakes shaped like female genitals. \nThe symbol of Aphrodite at Eryx was a golden honeycomb. 2 Her \n)riestess bore the name of Melissa, "Queen Bee," the same as the \newish Queen Deborah, priestess of Asherah, whose name also meant \n*bee." 3 \n\n\n\nThe bee was rightly looked upon as a symbol of the feminine potency of \nnature. . . . In the Syracusan Thesmophoria, the participants carried \nmylloi, cakes made of honey and sesame in the shape of the female sex \norgan. . . . Menzel draws an apt parallel between this custom and the \nHindu usage of daubing the woman \'s genitals with honey at the marriage \nfeast. 4 \n\n\n\nBees are still called hymenoptera, "veil-winged, after the hy- \nnen or veil that covered the inner sanctum of the Goddess\'s temples, \nhe veil having its physical counterpart in women\'s bodies. Deflora- \nion was a ritual penetration of the veil under the "hymeneal" rules of \nhe Goddess, herself entitled Hymen in the character of patroness of \nhe wedding night and "honey-moon." \n\nThe honeymoon spanned a lunar month, usually in May, the \nnonth of pairings, named after the Goddess as the Virgin Maya. 5 In \nin archaic period, sacred kings seem to have been destroyed after a 28- \nlay honeymoon with the Goddess, spanning a lunar cycle, as the \n\n\n\nBracara Modern \nBraga, in northern \nPortugal, first settled \nby Romans under the \nname of Bracara \nAugusta. An early- \nchurch council was \nheld there in 563 a.d. \n\n\n\n407 \n\n\n\nHope, Saint \n\n\n\nPorphyry (ca. 234- \n305 a.d.) Neoplatonist \nphilosopher, scholar, \nand writer; biographer \nof Plotinus; an \nopponent of the \nChristian church, \nwhich eventually \ndestroyed most of his \nbooks. \n\n\n\nqueen bee destroys her drone-bridegroom by tearing out his genitals. 6 \n\nAs applied to ordinary weddings rather than sacrificial dramas, the \nhoneymoon of a lunar month would include a menstrual period, the \nreal source of what was euphemistically called moon-honey. A bride- \ngroom contacted the source of life by copulating with his bride during \nmenstruation, according to the oldest Oriental belief. Even the Great \nGod Shiva was helpless unless his phallus was baptized in blood from \nthe vagina of Kali-Maya, his Shakti and mother, in the Tantric ritual \nknown as Maharutti. 7 \n\nA combination of honey and menstrual blood was once consid- \nered the universal elixir of life, the "nectar" manufactured by \nAphrodite and her sacred bees, which kept the very gods alive. Similarly, \nthe great secret of Norse mythology was that the gods\' nectar of \nwisdom, inspiration, literacy, magic, and eternal life was a combination \nof honey and "wise blood" from the great Cauldron in the belly of \nMother Earth though a late patriarchal revision claimed this hydromel \nor "honey-liquid" was a mixture of honey with the blood of a male \nsacrificial victim known as Wisest of Men. 8 \n\nEven the most patriarchal cults seemed unable to dispense with the \nlife-giving feminine fluids. Celibate priests of Mithra, who excluded \nwomen from their temples, nevertheless worshipped the Moon-goddess \nDiana or Luna who "made the honey which was used in the \npurifications." 9 Of course it was the Moon-goddess who also made the \n"wise blood" of female lunar cycles. Porphyry reported a popular \nbelief in his day that bees were reincarnations of the lunar nymphs. 10 \n\nFinnish myth speaks of the hero Lemminkainen, torn to pieces like \na sacrificial victim and sent to Manala, the underground realm of the \ndeath-goddess Mana. His own mother restored him to life with her \nmagic honey, assisted by her familiar spirit, Mehilainen the Bee. 11 \n\nEarly Christian Ophites celebrated a Tantric-style "love feast" \nwhich included the tasting of menstrual blood, and it was said of them 1 \nthat they mingled blood with honey. 12 Thus they combined two of the \nthree substances the third being salt most often associated with \nresurrection or rebirth. \n\nI.

Zeus sent the \nvase full of Spites to plague humanity with vice, madness, sickness, hard \nlabor, war, famine, and every other ill; he also enclosed Hope, whose i \n\n\n\n408 \n\n\n\nfunction was to prevent men from killing themselves in despair, to \nkscape the miseries Zeus decreed for them. 1 \n\nHope was thus presented as a spirit of delusion; her ultimate \npurpose was to make men suffer. In Christian scriptures however, she \nIvas combined with Faith and Charity (or Love) as one of the three \nessential virtues. Some excessively naive hagiographers even canon- \nized these three virtues as three fictitious virgin martyrs, all daughters of \nhe equally fictitious St. Sophia. 2 St. Hope is still listed in the Roman \npanon of saints even though scholars have shown that she never existed. \n\n1.

The dance still \npilled hora was based on the priestesses\' imitation of the zodiacal \n(circling of "hours." Time-keeping is horology because of the systems \nDevised by these ancient priestesses of the Goddess. See Prostitution. \niThe Horae were called "fair ones, begetters of all things, who in \nAppointed order bring on day and night, summer and winter, so as to \nJnake months and years grow full." \' \n\n1. Jonas, 258. \n\n\n\nIn Egypt they were \n"Ladies of the Hour," \nin Persia houris, in \nBabylon harines; among \nSemites they were \nthe "whores" called hor \n(a hole), ancestresses \nof the Horites. \n\n\n\nHorns \n\nPerhaps the most distinguishing feature of a divine being used to be a \nlorned head. Masks and crowns of incarnate deities were often those of \nlorned animals bulls, goats, stags. Horns were connected with the \nBldest Tantric belief concerning male vitality: that by suppression of \njjaculation, mystic energy mounts up the spine to the head and \n/ers forth in wisdom and magic power, made visible by horns. \n\nOutgrowths from the head are specially significant. The horned animals \nare the most sacred, because they carry about upon them visible \nevidence that their "head-stuff\' is developed to the point of extrusion. \nBulls, rams and he-goats are especially well-endowed. So too are deer. \nThere is ample linguistic evidence in the West for the association between \nhorns and male sexuality. In Indian miniatures and ivories of the \nseventeenth and eighteenth century A.D. horned deer are frequently used \nas symbols for the desire of a lovely girl in the forest. \' \n\nThe Bible says Yahweh\'s altar was horned, and he was some- \nImes addressed as a phallic stone, "the Rock that begat thee," as well as \nlie phallic "horn of my salvation, my high tower" (2 Samuel 22:3). \nlahweh was identified with El, "supreme god of the Semitic pantheon" \n\n\n\n409 \n\n\n\nHorns \n\n\n\nSir Thomas \n\nBrowne (1605-1682) \nEnglish physician, \nauthor of the famous \nReJigio Medici and \nother works. \n\n\n\nwho wore bull-horns as consort of Mari-Asherah the divine cow. 2 \nLike Zeus and Apis, he could take the form of the white moon-bull, \nprobably copied from totemic incarnations of Shiva as the white bull \nNandi (Blessed One). \n\nThe white moon-bull seems to have been one of the forms of the \nmoon god Sin, whose holy Mount Sinai Moses climbed, and came \ndown "wearing horns" in token of his encounter with the god of the \nmountain. The standard biblical translation says Moses came down \nfrom Sin\'s mountain with his head "shining," but in Hebrew, the same \nword signifies a "horned" or a "radiated" head. 5 The Vulgate says \ncornuta fuit fades ejus, he (Moses) wore horns. Michelangelo\'s famous \nfigure of Moses is horned like a satyr. 4 \n\nThe Horned God was as old as the Stone Age. Primitive sacred art \neverywhere shows men wearing the horns of bulls, stags, rams, or \ngoats, which distinguished the shaman, sacred king, priest, or victim. 5 \nHorned animals were frequently associated with Mother Goddess \nfigures. 6 Myths of all later periods also combined the Goddess with the \nHorned God, who was Actaeon the stag, Pan the goat, Dionysus or \nZeus the bull, Amen the ram, and innumerable combinations of these \nwith human images. The Teutonic hero Sigurd or Siegfried was \nsometimes a man, sometimes a hart, consort of the White Hind who led \nmen on mysterious adventures. He found his mother-bride in the \nform of a Valkyrie sleeping in her secret place, Hinderfjall (Hind- \nMountain). 7 Later he died in the forest as a hunted stag, pierced by \narrows, like Actaeon the Lord of the Hunt and his medieval counter- \npart, the witches\' Horned God. \n\nMedieval folk thought it might be possible for human beings to \ngrow real horns on their heads for a variety of reasons, from telling \nlies (through identification with the devil as Father of Lies) to becoming \na cuckold. Agrippa von Nettesheim offered a pseudo-scientific \nexplanation for the alleged overnight horning of Cyprus, king of Italy. \nThe king dreamed all night of a battle of bulls, which stimulated "the \nvegetative power, being stirred up by a vehement imagination, elevating \ncomific humors into his head and producing horns." 8 \n\nOf course the principal Horned God was the devil, a composite of \nall the Horned Gods of paganism.
