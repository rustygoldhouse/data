'Sacred alphabets of the ancient world signified birth and beginning by \nthe letter A. This letter meant the Creatress, who invented alphabets \nand gave them to mankind though most traditions said womankind \nhad them first. \n\nBabylonians called the Great Mother "A", the Beginning; or Aya, \nthe Mother of All Things. 1 Tantric sages called her birth-letter Alpa \nAkshara, "the letter A, which is considered the \'mother of all wisdom,\' \nand therefore of all men of genius; all Bodhisattvas and Buddhas are \nsaid to have been produced by \'A\'." 2 \n\nThe Greeks held similar views about the letter Alpha, which de- \nnoted the river of birth or creation. Its other name was Styx, the river \nof death, for in the cyclic system of the ancients, birth and death merged \nin a circular continuum. The river Styx circled seven times through \nthe earth\'s womb and emerged again as Alpha. \n\nX.Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 133-34. 2. Waddell, 161. \n\n\n\nAb \n\nEgyptian word for the heart-soul, most important of the seven souls: \nthe one that would be "weighed in the balances" by the Goddess Maat \nin the underworld Hall of Judgment after death. As in India, the \nheart-soul was pictured as a tiny dancer treading a constant rhythm in \nthe midst of the body, as Dancing Shiva or Dancing Kali kept the \nrhythm of life in the midst of the cosmos. The hieroglyphic sign of the \nab was a dancing figure. 1 See Heart. \n\n1. Budge, E.L., 44. \n\n\n\nvar. Abaton \n\n\n\nAbaddon \n\nThe god Apollo was a solar king in heaven during the day, and a \nLord of Death in the underworld at night. His latter form became the \nJewish Apollyon, Spirit of the Pit (Revelation 9:1 1). Apollo-Python \nwas the serpent deity in the Pit of the Delphic oracle, who inspired the \nseeress with mystic vapors from his nether world. The Greek word \nfor the Pit was abaton, which the Jews corrupted into Abaddon later a \nfamiliar Christian synonym for hell. \n\nAlso called a mundus or earth-womb, the abaton was a real pit, \nstandard equipment in a pagan temple. Those who entered it to \n"incubate," or to sleep overnight in magical imitation of the incubatory \nsleep in the womb, were thought to be visited by an "incubus" or \nspirit who brought prophetic dreams. 1 Novice priests went down into \nthe pit for longer periods of incubation, pantomiming death, burial, \nand rebirth from the womb of Mother Earth. Once initiated in this way, \nthey were thought to gain the skill of oneiromancy: the ability to \ninterpret dreams. \n\n\n\nThe Old Testament Joseph earned his oneiromantic talent by Abishag \n\nincubation in a Pit. The "brothers" who put him there seem to have \n\nbeen fellow priests. He could interpret Pharaoh\'s dreams only after he ^ \n\nhad submitted to the ritual. Assyrian priests derived similar powers \nfrom a sojourn in the Pit. 2 They then assumed the priestly coat of many \ncolors, signifying communion with the Goddess under her \noneiromantic name of Nanshe, "Interpreter of Dreams." 5 It seems \nlikely that Joseph\'s coat of many colors would have been given him \noriginally not before the initiation but afterward, by a "father" who was \nactually the high priest. 4 \n\nThe same burial-and-resurrection ritual is found in the lives of \nmany ancient sages. It was said of the Pythagorean philosopher \nThales of Miletus, accounted one of the Seven Wise Men of the \nancient world, that he derived his intellectual skills from communion \nwith the Goddess of Wisdom in an abaton. 5 \n\n1.

Larousse, 63. \n5. de Lys, 336. \n\n\n\nAbishag \n\nThe Bible claims the maiden Abishag was chosen for her beauty, to \nengender "heat" in the aged King David (1 Kings 1:2). This "heat" \nwas not mere warmth, but the sacred fire of sexual potency, without \nwhich no king could be allowed to rule. If an impotent king were kept in \noffice, his land would become barren. Hence, when David failed to \n"know" Abishag, a more virile prince (Adonijah) immediately prepared \nto assume the throne, and "exalted himself, saying, I will be king" \n(I Kings 1:5). David\'s death occurred with suggestive promptness after \nhis failure of the virility test. \n\nAbishag\'s name might be related to the Hindu abhiseka ceremony, \nthe anointing of kings with the sacred fluid of the Goddess Sarasvati. 1 \nFrom China to the Mediterranean, ancient kings derived their \nlegitimation from a mating with the Goddess through her priestess- \nsurrogate. 2 Mesopotamian kings and their deified souls, the gods, \nwere constantly described as "beloved" of the Goddess known as \ncreatress of the earth and "maker of fate, she who decrees the fate of \nthe men and gods." 5 Like the eastern Goddess, Abishag represented the \nland in the same way as Solomon\'s bride, whose mating was \nchronicled in the requisite intimate detail by the Song of Solomon. \n\nAfter David\'s death, the queen mother chose between rival candi- \ndates Solomon and Adonijah. She crowned Solomon with her own \nhands (Song of Solomon 3:11), after the custom of the royal women \nwhose business it was to enthrone or depose kings, as in India, Egypt, \nand the lands of the Fertile Crescent. 4 However, Adonijah still had \ndesigns on the throne, as shown by his request for the hand of \nAbishag in marriage. To prevent this symbolically and politically signifi- \ncant marriage from taking place, Solomon had Adonijah murdered \n\n\n\nAbortion (1 Kings 2:17-25). The Bible fails to explain Solomon\'s strangely \n\nviolent reaction to Adonijah\'s request; but it can only have meant that \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ the crown was at stake. This in turn shows that a sexual union with \n\nAbishag was a prerequisite for royal office. See Kingship. \n\n1. Gaster, 514. 2. Boulding, 191. 3. Pritchard, A.N.E. 1, 65; 2, 17, 21, 135, 202. \n4.Boulding,210. \n\n\n\nAbortion \n\nThe ancients generally viewed abortion as a woman\'s private busi- \nness, in which no man had any right to interfere. As Hartley put it, \n"Each woman must be free to make her own choice; no man may \nsafely decide for her; she must give life gladly to be able to give it well." 1 \nBut with the rise of patriarchal religions especially among the \nGreeks came a belief that a father\'s semen conveyed the soul to the \nfetus. Men feared for the safety of any of their body effluvia (hair \ncuttings, fingernail clippings, spittle, blood) lest sorcery might damage \nthe living man by damaging what was once a part of him. The fear \nwas particularly pronounced in the case of semen as an extension of the \nfather\'s soul. If the fetus he conceived were destroyed, then surely the \nman himself would suffer spiritual injury according to the principles of \nmagic. St. Thomas Aquinas held this same opinion, since he asserted \nthat semen was the vehicle of souls. 2 It was a logical extension of this \nnotion that abortion should be outlawed, not because it was danger- \nous to women, but because it was thought (magically) dangerous to \nmen. \n\nIn the east, however, abortion was perfectly legal at any time \nbefore the fifth month, when "quickening" was felt. After that, \naccording to Brahman scriptures, a woman who destroyed her fetus was \nheld guilty of murder, but before that time the fetus was soulless and \ncould be destroyed with impunity. 3 This opinion was embodied in the \nCatholic church\'s Doctrine of Passive Conception, which contradict- \ned Aquinas in order to prove that the soul comes only from God. Up to \nthe late 19th century, the Doctrine of Passive Conception declared \nthat the soul arrives in the fifth month of pregnancy, to quicken the \nfetus, which was previously soulless. 4 \n\nIn 1 869 the church again revised its opinion, tacitly admitting \neither that God had misinformed his church about his method of \ninstilling the soul into the body, or else that he had decided to alter it. \nPope Pius X announced that the soul was received at conception \nafter all. 5 \n\nActually, the church was only coming around, several decades late, \nto follow some new laws made by man, not by God. Abortion was \nnot classified as a crime in Europe until the 19th century. 6 The United \nStates first defined abortion as a criminal offense in the year 1830. 7 \n\nThe church now falsely pretends that it officially "always" opposed \nabortion. The medieval church\'s ire was aroused not by abortions per \n\n\n\nse but by the midwives who performed them. The handbook of the Abraham \n\nInquisition stated: "No one does more harm to the Catholic faith \n\nthan midwives." 8 (See Midwifery.) The church was not averse to ^^^^^^^^ \n\nkilling the unborn, since it burned many pregnant women as witches. \n\nEven the pregnant wife of a city councillor was tortured and burned at \n\nBamberg in 1630. 9 \n\nRecent opposition to legalization of abortion apparently stemmed \nfrom ignorance of how recently it was illegalized; and also from male \nbelief that women must be controlled by forcing childbirth on them. \n"Male legislators have laughed at the idea of the legalization of abor- \ntion, hinting at unprecedented promiscuity (on the part of women, not \nmen) if such a thing were allowed. Meanwhile, thousands of desper- \nate women die each year as the direct result of male laws making \nabortion illegal. Women are learning the meaning of this male \nlaughter and indifference in the face of the most hazardous and serious \nbiological enterprise women undertake, willingly or not." 10 \n\nThe Catholic church still claims authority over women\'s repro- \nductive functions. Catholic hospitals will refuse to abort even a fetus \nconceived by rape. 11 \n\nI. Hartley, 263. 2. Rees, 277. 3. Mahanirvanatantra, 269. 4. Briffault 2, 450. \n\n5.

But Islamic legends say Abraham was a \nlate intruder into the shrine of the Kaaba. He bought it from priestesses \nof its original Goddess. 1 Sarah, "the Queen," was one of the God- \ndess\'s titles, which became a name of Abraham\'s biblical "wife." 2 Old \nTestament writers pretended Sarah\'s alliances with Egyptian princes \nwere only love-affairs arranged by Abraham for his own profit which \nunfortunately presented him as a pimp (Genesis 12:16) as well as a \nwould-be murderer of his son (Genesis 22:10). \n\nIn the tale of Isaac\'s near-killing, Abraham assumed the role of \nsacrificial priest in the druidic style, to wash Jehovah\'s sacred trees \nwith the Blood of the Son: an ancient custom, of which the sacrifice of \nJesus was only a late variant. Jehovah first appeared to Abraham at \nthe sacred oak of Shechem, where Abraham built his altar. Later \nAbraham built an altar to the oak god of Mamre at Hebron. Even in \nthe 4th century a.d., Constantine said Abraham\'s home at the Oak of \nMamre was still a pagan shrine: "It is reported that most damnable \nidols are set up beside it, and that an altar stands hard by, and that \nunclean sacrifices are constantly offered." 3 \n\n1.

Abrasax \n\n\n\nAbraxas \n\nGnostic god identified with both Mithra and Jehovah, called "Our \nFather" and "Lord of Hosts" in the early Christian era. 1 Like Mithra, \nAbraxas represented "the 365 Aeons," 365,000 years allotted to the \npresent world\'s life span, based on the Hindu idea that one god- \nyear equals a thousand man-years. Jewish scripturists incorporated this \nbelief into Psalms 90:4, and into the First Book of Adam and Eve, \nwhere God said his five and a half days meant 5,500 years for man. 2 \nNumerical values of Mithra\'s and Abraxas\'s names each totaled 365. \nBoth were gods of numerology. \n\nOrthodox Christianity came to view Abraxas as a demon, because \nhe was assimilated to the Gnostic "Lord of This World" whose \nattributes were both divine and demonic. As the Creator of the material \nuniverse, he was declared a devil via the Gnostic opinion that all \nmatter was evil. Thus, he and his works the material world itself \nwould be destroyed at doomsday. 5 Nevertheless, through the Middle \nAges Abraxas was a favorite deity of several heretical sects. \n\n1. Budge, AT., 209. 2. Forgotten Books, 6. 3. Legge 2, 239. \n\n\n\nAbsalom \n\nThe Bible presents Absalom as either David\'s son or David\'s neigh- \nbor (2 Samuel 12:1 1) because biblical writers couldn\'t decide just where \nhe came from. He was important only as a surrogate "king" of the \nJews. His name, Father Salm, was a widely distributed sacred-king \nname, also rendered Salma, Salem, Salomon, or Solomon; in Assyria, \nShalmaneser; in Crete, the "son of God" Salmoneus. 1 The name \nmeant Prince of Peace, which was synonymous with Lord of Death \nbecause "Peace" was the Lord\'s word of farewell as he descended into \nthe underworld. \n\nCanaanites worshipped Father Salm at the city of Salem, whose \nPalestinian counterpart was Jeru-salem, "House of Salem." Kings of \nDavid\'s ancestral tribe, the Kenites, took the sacred name when ruling \nin Jerusalem. Probably several of these kings were called Solomon, \nincluding the biblical one whose real name was Jedidiah, according to 2 \nSamuel 12:25. \n\nAbsalom received the sacred name and died as a surrogate for the \nincumbent king, David, whose mourning for him was really a \nliturgical formula. He called Absalom "my son, my son," and cried \n"Would God I had died for thee" to disguise the fact that the victim \nreally had died in his place. Among ancient Semites generally, someone \nhad to die for the king at regular intervals, to preserve the fertility of \nthe soil and the people with his blood. See Kingship. \n\nTime-honored precedent dictated the format of the drama. The \nchosen victim sat on the throne, and publicly copulated with the royal \nwomen under a marriage canopy (2 Samuel 16:22). See Huppah. \n\n\n\nAfter this, Absalom was declared a god and his phallic spirit was Abtu \n\nimmortalized by an erect pillar (2 Samuel 1 8: 1 8). He was hung on a Achilles \n\nsacred oak "between heaven and earth," like all victims offered to ^^^^^^^^^ m \n\ndeities of the air and sky. 2 He was pierced through the heart by three \ndarts, like the Egyptian god Set. He was dismembered by ten men in \npriests\' livery (2 Samuel 18:14-1 5). According to the old custom, pieces \nof him were then distributed to the fields and vineyards to encourage \nthe growth of crops. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 363-64. 2. Angus, 173. \n\n\n\nAbtu \n\nThe "Abyss," sometimes called Fish of Isis, representing her genital \norifice, which "swallowed" the penis of Osiris. Abtu was the Egyptian \nname of Abydos, an early yonic shrine where the god died and \nentered his Mother\'s womb, the underworld. See Fish. \n\n\n\nAcedia \n\n"Abysmal apathy," ecclesiastical term for the acute depression afflict- \ning those in the monastic life. 1 They recognized that acedia \nmade monks and nuns especially susceptible to demonic possession. \nSee Possession. \n\n1. Mumford, 302. \n\n\n\nAchamoth \n\nMother Goddess who gave birth to the creator of the material uni- \nverse, according to early Gnostic Christians. 1 She was the third \nperson of a primordial female trinity consisting of Sige, Sophia, \nand Achamoth comparable to northern Europeans\' divine Great- \nGrandmother, Grandmother, and Mother. 2 The three of them \nchastised the male creator for excessive hubris and other offenses. \nSee Sophia, Saint. \n\n1. Legge 2, 69. 2. Turville-Petre, 147. \n\n\n\nAchilles \n\nHomeric hero of the Iliad, greatest of the Greek warriors at the siege \nof Troy. Achilles was a son of the Sea-goddess, here called Thetis, "She \nWho Disposes." Most of his body was invulnerable because his \nmother dipped him in the holy river Styx when he was an infant; but \nthe spot on his heel, where her fingers held him, was not exposed to \n\n\n\nAciel the magical waters. Therefore he could be, and was, killed by an arrow \n\nAdam in his heel, as was the Hindu Krishna. Hence any area of vulnerability \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ in an otherwise strong structure or person is known as an Achilles Heel. \n\nLike Heracles, Achilles lived for some time in female disguise, \nrecalling the priesthoods of Homeric and pre-Homeric times who \nwore women\'s clothing to attain the powers of divinity. \n\n\n\nAciel \n\nBlack Sun of the Chaldean underworld; the god of darkness at the \nbottom of the sevenfold Pit, exactly mirroring the gods of light at the top \nof the seventh heaven. Most underground gods and Lords of Death \nwere similar to Aciel Hades, Pluto, Saturn, Ahriman, Apollyon, \nPython, Zeus Chthonios, and their later composite, the Judeo-Christian \ndevil. Jewish writers made Aciel a "prince of Gehenna" and corrupted \nhis name to Arsiel. 1 He was not always devilish or evil. Oriental religions \ngenerally recognized that a principle of darkness was necessary to life, for \nonly in the nether darkness could regeneration take place. \n1.

Larousse, 29. \n\n\n\nAdam \n\nLiterally, a man made of blood; in pre-biblical myths, a creature \nformed by the Goddess of Earth from her own clay (adamah), given life \n\n\n\nby her blood. (See Eve.) The idea of Adam\'s rib was taken from a Adam-Kadmon \n\nSumerian Goddess who formed infants\' bones from their mothers\' ribs. Adelphos \n\nShe was both Lady of the Rib, and Lady of Life. Her name carried ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nboth meanings at once. 1 See Birth-giving, Male. \nl.Hooke.M.E.M., 115. \n\n\n\nAdam-Kadmon \n\nGnostic image of primordial man: an innocent know-nothing, a brute \nAdam made of mud. Probably based on the most ancient Middle- \nEastern view of humanity as a race of peasant-slaves created by the \ngods to be farm workers and nothing else. In occult tradition Adam- \nKadmon was the perennial Fool, or Prince of Fools, symbolizing \nthe unenlightened man. His name was given to the zero-numbered \nFooloftheTarot. 1 \n\nl.Gettings, 111. \n\n\n\nAdamu \n\nSumero-Babylonian version of the first man; one of the sources for \nthe biblical figure of Adam. The gods tricked him and his descendants \nout of immortality because they didn\'t want mere mortals to become \ndeathless like gods. They lied to the man, telling him the magic food of \neternal life would kill him if he ate it. So he refused it and lost his \nchance to escape death forevermore. 1 \n\nThe biblical God also showed concern lest human beings should \neat the food of eternal life (Genesis 3:22). God told Adam the same \nlie that the Babylonian god told Adamu: "Thou shalt not eat of it: for in \nthe day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Genesis 2:17). \nAdam ate, but he didn\'t die in the same day. On the contrary, he lived \nto the age of 930 years (Genesis 5:5). It was the serpent who told the \ntruth about the controversial food: "Ye shall not surely die; for God \ndoth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be \nopened, and ye shall be as gods" (Genesis 3:4-5). \n\nl.Hooke.M.E.M., 57-58. \n\n\n\nAdelphos \n\nGreek word for "brother," dating back to the matriarchal period \nwhen kinship was reckoned only through a mother.

O\'Flaherty, 339; Mahanirvanatuntrx, x 1 . \n\n\n\nMagic Papyri \n\nCollections of \nexorcisms, invocations, \ncharms, and spells \nwidely circulated during \nthe early Christian \nera, used as bases for \nlater grimoires and \nHermetic texts. \n\n\n\nAdonis \n\nGreek version of Semitic Adonai, "The Lord," a castrated and \nsacrificed savior-god whose love-death united him with Aphrodite, or \nAsherah, or Mari. In Jerusalem, his name was Tammuz. \n\nAdonis was born at Bethlehem, in the same sacred cave that \nChristians later claimed as the birthplace of Jesus. 1 He was the son of \nthe Virgin Myrrha, a temple-woman or hierodule, identified with Mary \nby early Christians who called Jesus\'s mother Myrrh of the Sea. 2 \nMyrrh was a symbol of the Lord\'s death, in both pagan and Christian \ntraditions. He returned to his Great Mother, the sea, Aphrodite-Mari. \nAlexandrian priestesses celebrated the event by throwing the god\'s \nimage into the sea. 3 \n\nSyrian Adonis died at Easter time, with the flowering of the red \nanemone, supposedly created from his blood. Its name was derived \nfrom his title, Naaman, "darling." He was also called the Beautiful God, \nlike other gods of the spring flowering, such as Narcissus, Antheus, \nHyacinthus. \n\nAnother form of the same god was Anchises, castrated after his \nmating with Aphrodite. Adonis, too, was castrated: "gored in the \ngroin" by Aphrodite\'s boar-masked priest. His severed phallus became \nhis "son," the ithyphallic god Priapus, identified with Eros in Greece \nor Osiris-Min in Egypt. Priapus carried a pruning knife in token of the \nLord\'s necessary castration before new life could appear on earth. 4 \n\nCastrating the god was likened to reaping the grain, which Adonis \npersonified. His rebirth was a sprouting from the womb of the earth. \nEach year, sacred pots called kernos or "gardens of Adonis" were \nplanted with wheat or millet, and allowed to sprout at Easter. The \ncustom was followed in Mediterranean countries up to the present \ncentury. 5 The clay pot signified the womb. Sometimes in processions \nit was a gigantic kernos carried on a chariot, having the special name \nof kalanthos. 6 \n\nAdonis died and rose again in periodic cycles, like all gods of \nvegetation and fertility. He was also identified with the sun that died \nand rose again in heaven. An Orphic hymn said of him: "Thou shining \nand vanishing in the beauteous circle of the Horae, dwelling at one \ntime in gloomy Tartarus, at another elevating thyself to Olympus, \ngiving ripeness to fruits." 7 He was buried in the same cave (womb) \nthat gave him birth. It is now the Milk Grotto, whose dust is supposed to \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\n\nbenefit nursing mothers; it was said Mary nursed Jesus there. 8 The Adultery \n\nGrotto was sealed as Jesus\'s sepulchre, for in the cults of both Jesus and Aeneas \n\nAdonis the virgin womb was the same as the virgin tomb, "wherein ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nnever man before was laid" (Luke 23:53). \n\nThe Magic Papyri said Jesus and Adonis also shared the same \nname-magic. "Adonai" was the highest god, having the True Name \nthat could work miracles. 9 Centuries later, Christian authorities declared \nthat "Adonai" was a demon. \n\n1. Doane, 155; Briffault 3, 97. 2.

Patriarchal societies therefore sought to insure \nwives\' sexual fidelity for economic reasons. 2 \n\nTo this end, the Bible commands stoning to death an adulterous \nwife or a bride suspected of oremarital affairs (Deuteronomy 22:21). \nThe latter rule was to invalicate the pagan custom of premarital \ndefloration by a stranger, lest someone other than the husband might \nhave a claim on the bride\'s property. 5 Hebrew patriarchs also considered \n"adulterous" a widow who might remarry "unto a stranger" outside \nthe paternal clan. Widows were ordered to marry the brother of a \ndeceased husband, so their property would remain under the control \nof male in-laws. This law of Levirate Marriage with its apparently divine \nsanction caused much trouble in later centuries. \n\n1. Brasch, 125. 2. Hartley, 165, 171. 3.

By the 7th century a.d. the agape ceremony was \ndeclared heretical, but it continued secretly throughout the Middle \nAges. 2 See Menstrual Blood. \n\n1. Attwater, 34. 2. Sadock, Kaplan & Freedman, 23. \n\n\n\n12 \n\n\n\nAgatha, Saint Agatha, Saint \n\n"Kindly One," a spurious saint based on images of the lactating A gnes, Saint \n\nGoddess offering bared breasts in the usual Ishtar pose. As a fictitious p \n\n"virgin martyr," Agatha refused to marry the king of Sicily, who \n\nvengefully ordered her breasts sliced off. Early Christian icons showed \n\nher carrying them on a patera (offering dish) as St. Lucy carried her \n\neyeballs. 1 Later, the amputated breasts were misinterpreted as bells; so \n\nAgatha became patroness of bell founders. 2 Her legend may have \n\narisen from the Christian habit of knockingthe breasts off statues of \n\npriestesses and Goddesses. 3 \n\nThe original Agatha was surnamed Tyche (Fate), and worshipped \nat the subterranean womb-oracle of Trophonios at Lebadeia. 4 Like \nthe Goddess of the similar womb-oracle at Delphi, she was accompa- \nnied by a Great Serpent: the oracular spirit named Agathodemon, \ngod of Kindly Fortune, worshipped by Orphic sects up to the 5th and \n6th centuries a.d. Far from tormenting Agatha as her Christian \nlegend claimed, Sicilian kings won their thrones by way of a sacred \nmarriage with her. Many of these kings took the name of Agathocles, \n"Glory of Agatha," just as Heracles called himself "Glory of Hera." 5 \n\nThe Golden Legend conferred on St. Agatha the curious title of \nSavior of Her Country, saying "She accomplished the deliverance of \nher native land." 6 This probably referred to votive images of the \nGoddess which were supposed to preserve the land from all external \ndangers. \n\n1.

However, her true nature as an orgiastic priestess- \nheroine might be guessed from her ineradicable connections with \nlove and marriage. A priest became her bridegroom by placing a \nwedding ring on the finger of her statue, as if it were the statue of \nAphrodite-Galatea. 3 Bollandus\'s Acts of the Saints said Agnes founded \nher nunnery in a house of sacred prostitutes, like priestesses of \nAphrodite-Salacia. 4 All the way up to the present century, St. Agnes\'s \nEve was the traditional time for girls to divine the names of their \nfuture lovers by means of magic mirrors. 5 \n\n13 \n\n\n\nAgni Unfortunately for St. Agnes\'s credibility, she is said to have suf- \n\nAhriman fered in the reign of Constantine when Christians were not \n\n^ wmgn persecuted. It was also falsely claimed that Agnes cured Constantine\'s \ndaughter of leprosy. Roman Jews were said to have worshipped her in \na church on the Via Nomentana, built in her honor in 350 a.d.; but \nRoman Jews didn\'t worship Christian saints, and no churches were \nbuilt in honor of female martyrs in 350 a.d. 6 Roman Jews probably did, \nhowever, worship at least one version of Agna the Holy Lamb. \n\nThough Catholic scholars now say Agnes\'s legends have been \nfound "disappointingly" devoid of truth, her relics are still preserved \nin Rome and constantly adored by the faithful. 7 \n\n1.

She represented the primal ocean of blood from which all \nthings arose at creation; he represented the fructifying fire from \nheaven (lightning); their combination meant vital heat. Vedic sages said \nthe soul of all the universe, moving and still, is made of a combination \nof blood and fire. Agni also appeared to consume sacrifices that were \nburned on their altars. He was a prototype of such Indo-European \nfire-bringers as Lucifer, Prometheus, Etana, Hephaestus, and Heracles. 1 \n1.0\'Flaherty,97, 148,339. \n\n\n\nAhriman \n\nGreat Serpent, Lord of Darkness, and rival of the sun god in Persian \nmyth; leader of the daevas, whom Zoroastrians called devils, though the \noriginal Indo-Iranian word meant "gods." 1 (See Serpent.) \n\nThe story of Ahriman\'s revolt against his twin brother, the Heav- \nenly Father, of their war in heaven, and of the daevas\'faW to the \nunderworld, gave western Europe its basic myth of the fall of Lucifer, \nand its dualistic division of the universe between forces of good and \nevil. Persian prophets predicted the defeat of Ahriman and his dark \nangels during the final battle at the end of the world, and Judeo- \nChristian prophets adopted the same idea. As the Serpent, Ahriman also \ntempted the first man and woman. \n\nBut Ahriman was not considered inferior to the Heavenly Father. \nOn the contrary, they were twins, born simultaneously from the \nwomb of the primal Crone of Time (Zurvan). Ahriman\'s influence on \nearth was greater than his celestial brother\'s, because he created the \nmaterial world. Persian Magi regarded him as the source of their magic \npower, and offered sacrifices to him. Mithraic shrines from Budapest \n\n\n\n14 \n\n\n\nto York were dedicated to "Arimanius" as the underground god of \nmagic arts. 2 \n\nAhriman was not originally Persian. He was the Vedic god \nAryaman, maker of "Aryans" the people he created of clay. \nAryaman was one of the twelve zodiacal sons of the Goddess Aditi. 3 \nHe also had a Celtic incarnation, as the divine king Eremon. \n\nl.Lamusse, 317. 2.

O\'Flaherty, 339. \n\n\n\nAhura Mazda \nAkka \n\n\n\nAhura Mazda \n\nPersian sun god born as the twin brother of the dark god Ahriman \nfrom the womb of Infinite Time, the Primal Creatress. The fight \nbetween the brothers, resulting in Ahriman\'s fall from heaven, had \nthe same cause as the rivalry between Cain and Abel that is, the \nsacrificial offering of one was accepted by the older deity; that of the \nother was rejected. The older deity was Vayu, probably a derivative of \nthe Vedic celestial androgyne Varuna, or Mitra-Varuna, whose other \nname became "Mithra". \n\nThe story of the battle and the fall might have been a revision of \nthe ancient creation myth concerning the Goddess\'s punishment of \nher first-created serpent-consort for his hubris. 1 The name Ahura was \nonce a feminine name. 2 \n\nMiddle Persian forms of the name were Ormazd, Ormizd, or \nHormizd. These names were commonly taken by kings who embod- \nied the god\'s solar spirit, especially kings of the Iranian Sassanian \ndynasty. 3 Being naturally deified after death, such kings had cult \ncenters and groups of priests who kept up their worship. One of these \napparently became converted to Christianity and contributed another \napocryphal saint to the Christian canon, usually misspelled "St. Hor- \nmidz," though Hormizd was obviously meant. This saint was vaguely \nplaced in the 5th century a.d. and declared a Persian martyr, though his \nlegend lacked every kind of foundation, even that of common sense. \nIt was claimed that, for a refusal to renounce Christianity, St. Hormidz \nwas condemned to serve as a military camel-driver which may not \nhave been precisely a life of luxury, but hardly qualified as martyrdom. 4 \nThis sun-god-turned-saint was revered through the early Middle \nAges by cult centers located in Persia and Iraq. \n\n1.

She was the "Water-drawer" who \nbrought gods to birth out of the primal deep the feminine prototype \n\n\n\nvar. Ormazd, \nOrmizd, Hormizd \n\n\n\n15 \n\n\n\nAladdin of Aquarius. A similar Central-American Goddess figure had curiously \n\nsimilar names, Acat or Akna. 1 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Akka had many related names. Greeks called her Acco or Acca, \n\n"She Who Fashions." 2 To Lapps and Finns in northern Europe, she \nwas Mader-Akka Mother Akka who created humanity. 3 To Ro- \nmans, she was Acca Larentia, or Acca the mother of the Lares, which \nwere archaic ancestral spirits left over from pre-Roman Latium. \n\nAcca Larentia was variously called the first Vestal Virgin, or a \ntemple prostitute, or a rich courtesan, or a virgin bride of God roles \nthat may seem mutually contradictory but were not so (see Prostitu- \ntion; Vestal Virgins). As the divine midwife, she helped Rhea Silvia \ngive birth to Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome. She drew the \ndivine twins out of their floating basket on the river Tiber, just as \nAkka of Akkad drew Sargon out of his floating basket on the river Tigris, \nand "Pharaoh\'s daughter" drew Moses from the Nile. \n\nAcca Larentia was honored every year at the Roman festival of the \nLarentalia. She was assimilated to the cult of Heracles, who became \none of her husbands. In his Roman temple, Heracles was mated to \n"Acca, the Maker." 4 \n\n1. Lamusse, 439. 2. Graves, CM. 2, 190. 3.

As the fairy tale said, he was master of a \nsecret cave of treasures, but the cave was real. It was located in the \nfortified valley of Alamut near Kazvin, headquarters of the fanatical \nbrotherhood of hashish im or "hashish-takers," which Christians mis- \npronounced "assassins." \n\nAladdin was an Old Man of the Mountain, hereditary title of the \nchief of hashishim, beginning with a Shi\'ite leader Hasan ibn al- \nSabbah, whose name meant Son of the Goddess (see Arabia). The later \nname of Aladdin was taken by several chieftains. In 1297 the region \nof Gujarat was conquered by a warrior called the Bloody One, \nAla-ud-den. 1 \n\nBy means of drugs and an elaborate "paradise" staffed by human \nHouris, initiates into the brotherhood were persuaded that they died \nand went to heaven, or Fairyland, where gardens and palaces occupied \nthe valley of the secret cave. Special conduits flowed with the Four \nRivers of Paradise: water, wine, milk, and honey. Each candidate was \ndrugged into a stupor, then woke and "perceived himself surrounded \nby lovely damsels, singing, playing, and attracting his regards by the \nmost fascinating caresses, serving him also with delicate foods and \nexquisite wines; until intoxicated with excess of enjoyment amidst actual \n\n\n\n16 \n\n\n\nrivulets of milk and wine, he believed himself assuredly in Paradise, Alako \n\nand felt an unwillingness to relinquish its delights." 2 Alani \n\nAfter this period of bliss, the warrior was again drugged and taken ^^^^^^^^^^ \nout of the secret place, to fight in the service of the Old Man of the \nMountain. He fought fearlessly, in the belief that death in battle would \ninstantly carry him back to that heaven cleverly made real for him. \nPromises of sexual bliss were the real key to the ferocity of Islamic \narmies. The Koran said each hero who died in battle would achieve \nan eternity of pleasure among heavenly Houris with "big, beautiful, \nlustrous eyes." 3 \n\nAladdin\'s sect worshipped the moon as a symbol of the Goddess, \nlike the Vessel of Light associated with both the virgin Mary and the \nHoly Grail in western Europe. 4 Eastern poets said the Vessel of Light \nproduced djinn, "spirits of ancestors." This Vessel was simultaneous- \nly Aladdin\'s lamp, source of djinni (a genie), and the moon, source of all \nsouls according to the most ancient beliefs. The moon was the realm \nof the dead, and also the realm of rebirth since all souls were recycled \nthrough many revolutions of the wheels of Fate. The divine Houris \nalso dwelt in the moon, which probably was the light of Aladdin\'s secret \ncave. See Moon. \n\nThe Arabian Nights gave the password to Aladdin\'s cave: Open, \nSesame. This was related to Egyptian seshemu, "sexual intercourse." \nThe hieroglyphic sign of seshemu was a penis inserted into an arched \nyoni-symbol. 5 Every ancient culture used some form of sexual \nsymbolism for the idea of man-entering-paradise. \n\nl.Zimmer ( 54. 2.

Trigg, 202. \n\n\n\nAlani \n\n"Hunting dogs," Greek name for the Scythian tribes who wor- \nshipped Artemis as their Divine Huntress. The name Alan still carried \nthe original Greek meaning of a hunting dog when it became popular \namong the Scots during the Middle Ages. Artemis was often called the \nGreat Bitch, and her hunting priestesses were the "sacred bitches" \nwho chased, killed, and consumed boar-gods and stag-gods like Phorcis \nor Actaeon. Thus, to Christians, "son of a bitch" meant a devil \nworshipper that is, a pagan devotee of the Goddess. See Dog. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n\n\nAlban, Saint Alban, Saint \n\nAlchemy Fictitious saint called "protomartyr of England," allegedly the first \n\nmmmmtammmatmm Christian martyr in the British isles, slain on Holmhurst Hill in 287 a.d. \nHowever, no writer made any reference to him until two hundred \nyears later. Gildas finally developed St. Alban\'s legend in the 6th \ncentury, with some confusion of dates. He claimed St. Alban shel- \ntered a Christian fleeing from Diocletian\'s persecution, twenty years \nbefore Diocletian\'s persecution began. 1 \n\nThe real origin of St. Alban probably was nothing more than the \nBritish Goddess\'s title of Albion, "White Moon." Her shrine at \nHolmhurst Hill had a sacred fountain, always shown between the feet of \n"Alban" in Christian art. 2 In Bede\'s day the place was still holy, and \nsomeone had to invent a Christianized and preferably masculinized \nlegend for it. \n\nl.Attwater, 37. 2. Brewster, 293. \n\n\n\nAlberich \n\nKing of the underworld in Teutonic myth, identified with the Saxon \nfairy-king Oberon. Alberich appeared in the Nibelungenlied as a chtho- \nnian dwarf master-smith, guardian of the Rhinemaidens\' buried \ntreasure. Like most versions of the demonic fairy king, he was a shape- \nshifter, appearing in such typically diabolic disguises as a toad and a \nserpent. He is still familiar to opera fans as a character in Wagner\'s Ring \nof the Nibelung. \n\n\n\nAlchemy \n\nIn Arabic, alchemy meant "matter of Egypt," Al-Khemeia, from \nKhemennu, "Land of the Moon," an old name for Egypt. 1 The Arabs \nthought alchemy was invented by Egyptians. Christians learned it \nfrom the Arabs and believed it was invented by Thoth, or Hermes, or \nthe virgin Mary. 2 \n\n"Mary the Jewess" was said to have been the first great alchemist. \nShe discovered distillation of alcohol in the time of the Caliphate, and \ninvented the double boiler, still called bain-marie (Mary\'s bath) in \nFrance. During the Renaissance some female alchemists were perse- \ncuted as witches. Julius, Duke of Brunswick, roasted one of them alive \nin an iron chair in 1 575, because she could not tell him how to make \ngold out of base metal. 3 \n\nAs a system of mysticism, alchemy was permeated by sexual \nsymbols. So-called "copulations" and "marriages" figured in alchem- \nical procedures. Sexual drawings enlivened the texts. The Alchemical \nRebus was the usual bisexual image of male and female powers in \nunion, "a Hermaphrodite, born of two mountains, Mercury and \n\n\n\n18 \n\n\n\nVenus." Sun and moon were shown as naked male and female Alchemy \n\nfigures, the moon saying to her spouse, "O Sun, thou dost nothing \n\nalone if I am not present with my strength, as a cock is helpless - - \n\nwithout a hen." 4 \n\nAlchemists sought the divine female power Sapientia, or Sophia \n(Wisdom), the Gnostics\' Great Mother. Valentin\'s L\'Azoth des \nphilosophes showed her as a crowned, fish-tailed Aphrodite rising from \nthe sea, spouting streams of milk and blood from her breasts. This \nwas a direct copy of Hindu representations of the virgin Maya, mother \nof the world. 5 Alchemists called her the Siren of the Philosophers, \n"born of our deep Sea (Maria), who pours milk and blood from her \npaps." 6 \n\nAn Italian manuscript showed two bearded sages avidly sucking \nher breasts, to absorb the secrets symbolized by her colors, milk white \nand blood red. 7 The same colors appeared on the Flower of the \nAlchemists, a five-petaled red-and-white rose, sometimes called the \nwomb of the FiJium philosophorum or Glorious Child. The same rose \nsymbolized the virgin Mary. 8 \n\nMary-Sophia was the Goddess of both Gnosticism and alchemy. \nThe Philosopher\'s Stone was sometimes called the Sophistical \nStone. 9 Alchemical writings called the hidden Goddess the Mother of \nWisdom, combining elements of the Madonna with those of the \npagan mother-image: \n\nlam the flower of the fleldand the lily of the valleys. lam the mother of \nfair love and of fear and of knowledge and of holy hope. . .lam the \nmediator of the elements. . . . lam the law in the priest and the word in \nthe prophet and the counsel in the wise. I will kill and I will make to \nlive and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. 10 \n\nSince the ancient Great Mother was represented by a Holy \nVase, alchemists sought the vas hermeticum (Womb of Hermes), which \nresembled the vas spirituale identified with the virgin Mary. Arab \nalchemists adopted the rosary from Far-Eastern cults of the Goddess, \nwhose rosary-symbol was a vase-shaped bead, from which the other \nbeads were said to "spring up." Rosaries dedicated to Mary also had the \nvase-shaped bead. Arabs called the rosary wardija, "rose-garden," \ncopying the Hindu japamala, "rose-chaplet," the necklace of Kali Ma, \nwho ruled the elements as alchemists also hoped to do. A Diirer \ndrawing of 1 506 shows a turbanned Arab alchemist with his rosary at his \nbelt. 11 \n\nMany alchemical texts presented obvious sexual allegories, e.g. \nfrom the Turba Philosophorum: "Take the white tree, build him a \nround, dark, dew-encircled house, and set in it a hundred-year-old man \nand close it so that no wind or dust can get to him; then leave him \nthere eight days. I tell you that that man will not cease to eat of the fruit \nof that tree till he becomes a youth. O what a wonderful nature, for \nhere is the father become son and born again." 12 \n\nSimilar allegorical references to the mysteries of reproduction were \n\n19 \n\n\n\nAlchemy common among Chinese alchemists, who spoke of attaining "longev- \n\nity through liquid gold," by "a red sulphurous ingredient in \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ goldmaking" the male and female essences in Taoist and Tantric \nsymbolism (see Menstrual Blood). One text said: \n\n/ must diligently plant my own field. There is within it a spiritual germ \nthat may live a thousand years. Its flower is like yellow gold. Its bud is \nnot large, but its seeds are round and like unto a spotless gem [i.e., the \nJewel in the Lotus]. Its growth depends upon the soil of the central \nplace [womb], but its irrigation must proceed from a higher fountain. Alter \nnine years [or, months] of cultivation, root and branch may be trans- \nplanted to the heaven of the higher genii. n \n\nChurchmen were baffled by alchemical language, and usually \nlet practitioners of this particular "devilish art" alone, unless they were \nwomen. Yet the official opposition to the whole science kept many of \nthe best minds away from it, thus helping to retard the development of \nmodern chemistry out of alchemical experimentation. 14 \n\nThe deep secrecy of the alchemists\' operations still puzzles many \nmodern scholars. Carl Jung wondered why these chemical processes \nhad to be disguised and distorted by thickets of mythological symbolism; \nor, if a mystical sort of enlightenment was being described, why it was \ntied to laboratory procedures. 15 The answer could be found in the \nalchemists\' political environment. "Natural science" was often de- \nfined as heresy by the church. In periods when the Inquisition was \nactive, almost anyone meddling with such matters was at risk. The \nbest defense was deliberately obscure allegorization, in which theologi- \ncal principles if any could be hidden. \n\nSome of the secret is given away by the preponderance of sexual \nsymbols in alchemical literature. "Copulation of Athene and Her- \nmes" might mean mixing sulfur and mercury in a retort; or it might \nmean a sexual "working" of the alchemist and his lady-love. Illustra- \ntions in alchemical books suggested sexual mysticism more often than \nnot. Adam and Eve were shown as naked lovers, halves of the Primal \nAndrogyne. Adam was pictured as incomplete male, who had to be \npierced by the Arrow of Mercurius to stimulate his passionate desire \nfor Wisdom. After this, his phallus bloomed into the flowering Tree of \nLife, signifying that he was ready for full union with a Goddess-like \nEve, who would make him complete. 16 \n\nMercurius or Hermes was the alchemical hero who fertilized \nthe Holy Vase, a womb-like sphere or egg from which the films \nphilosophorum was to be born. This vessel may have been real, a \nlaboratory flask or retort; more often, it seemed to be a mystical \nsymbol. 17 The Royal Diadem of its offspring was said to appear in \nmenstruo meretricis, "in the menstrual blood of a whore," who may \nhave been the Great Whore, an ancient epithet of the Goddess. Her \nmenstrual blood curdled in her womb to create the universe, including \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\n\nits metals, minerals, and other raw materials of alchemy. The Rosar- Alchemy \n\nium Phibsophorum (Rosary of the Philosophers) said the soul of the \n\nworld is made of male and female "matters": Anima est Sol et Luna. ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSimilarly a human soul was produced by male and female parents. \n\nSexual mystics held a theory that every individual person or thing had \n\nbut half a soul, which must find its other half in the opposite sex. 18 \n\nAt times the alchemists appeared to be seeking a lost deity, like the \ncabalists\' Shekina: the Mother {mater) sleeping in the material matter \nof the world, having been separated from the God whose other half she \nwas. Alchemists usually rejected the church\'s teaching that matter \nwas "evil" or "fallen." As Gnostic animists they thought the "savior" \ndestined to emerge from the alchemical matrix (mother-womb) was \nboth an anthropomorphic Glorious Child or Hlius macrocosmi, and a \n"miraculous stone" or Philosopher\'s Stone, possessing corpus, anima, \nspiritus, the "redeemer" of the inanimate universe. 19 As an enlightened \nmystic the alchemist hoped to attend the birth of this strange being, \nwho would teach him to transform base metals into gold, as eastern \nyogis were said to do when they were sufficiently enlightened. \n\nOne reason why the church opposed alchemy and identified it \nwith black magic was that many alchemical texts offered greater \nrevelations, more simply achieved, than the Bible or the pulpit could \noffer, and thus took on the character of a rival. For example, the \nAbtala Jurain (1732) presented the whole creation: \n\nTake of common rainwater a good quantity, at least ten quarts; preserve it \nwell sealed in glass vessels for at least ten days, then it will deposit \nmatter and feces on the bottom. Pour off the clear liquid and place it in a \nwooden vessel that is fashioned round like a ball; cut it in the middle \nand Hll the vessel a third full, and set it in the sun about midday in a secret \nor secluded spot. \n\nWhen this has been done, take a drop of the consecrated red wine \nand let it fall into the water, and you will instantly perceive a fog and a \nthick darkness on top of the water, such as also was at the first creation. \nThen put in two drops, and you will see the light coming forth from the \ndarkness; whereupon little by little put in every half of each quarter hour \nfirst three, then four, then live, then six, drops, and no more, and you \nwill see with your own eyes one thing after another appearing by and by \non top of the water, how God created all things in six days, and how it \nall came to pass, and such secrets as are not to be spoken aloud and I also \nhave not power to reveal. Pall on your knees before you undertake this \noperation. Let your eyes judge of it; for thus was the world created. Let all \nstand as it is, and in half an hour after it began it will disappear. \n\nBy this you will see clearly the secrets of God, that are at present \nhidden from you as from a child. You will understand what Moses has \nwritten concerning the creation; you will see what manner of body Adam \nand Eve had before and after the Fall, what the serpent was, what the \ntree, and what manner of fruits they ate; where and what Paradise is, and \nin what bodies the righteous shall be resurrected; not in this body that \n\n\n\n21 \n\n\n\nAlcmene we have received from Adam, but in that which we attain through the \n\nAllah Holy Ghost, namely in such body as our Savior brought from \n\n^^_^^__^_^_ Heaven. 20 \n\n1.

It was houloi in Greek, uluktus in Latin, hulluloo or hulla-baloo \n\nin Old Irish. 1 Herodotus said the "howlings in the temple" were derived \n\nfrom the cult of Athene in Libya, where "the women do it very \n\nwell." 2 \n\nAlleluia was used as a battle cry in the Middle Ages, and credited \nwith powerful victory-magic. The legend of St. Germain describes its \nuse in a battle between Saxons and Britons. As the cry of the god \nPan was supposed to cause "pan-ic" in his enemies, so the sound of \nalleluia was thought to kill the enemy\'s fighting spirit. 3 \n\nl.Hazlitt, 341. 2. Herodotus, 270. 3. de Voragine, 399. \n\n\n\nAlma Mater \n\n"Soul-Mother," a Roman teaching priestess, especially one empow- \nered to give instruction in the sexual Mysteries. (See Cowrie). The \nname was based on Al-Mah, a Middle-Eastern name of the Moon- \ngoddess, also a title of her temple women, almah the same word that \ndescribed the virgin Mary in the Hebrew versions of the Gospels. 1 \nThe priestess called alma materbore a relationship to the male initiate \nsimilar to that of the Tantric Shakti. \n\nl.Brasch, 25. \n\n\n\nAlphabet \n\nSee Motherhood. \n\n\n\nAltar \n\nThe custom of burying relics of saints under an altar began with a \nmisunderstanding of the scripture, "I saw under the altar the souls of \nthem that were slain for the word of God" (Revelation 6:9). This was \nbased on a pagan teaching, that the souls of the enlightened became \nstars in heaven. Those recently deceased stood on the border of the \nsky, under the constellation of the Altar, which lies close to the horizon \nas seen from Mediterranean latitudes. 1 \n\nThe Altar was a feminine constellation because the earliest altars \nwere modeled on the maternal hearth, and altars symbolized the \nMother. The Earth\'s regenerative womb was often represented as an \n\n\n\n23 \n\n\n\nAl-Uzza \nAmazons \n\n\n\naltar, which explains why "witch cults" were said to make an altar of \nthe belly of a living woman. The Heavenly Virgin was also an altar, Ara \nCoeli, "Altar of Heaven," she who received the souls of the dead. \nChristians adopted this symbolism from the virgin Mary. One of the \nNativity legends claimed the Cumaean Sybil showed Augustus a \nvision of Mary, saying, "This woman is the Altar of Heaven." A church \nwas built on the spot, and named Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. 2 \n\n1 .

Graves, W.G., 395. \n\n\n\nGaius Tranquillus \nSuetonius Roman \nbiographer and \nhistorian, ca. 70- \n\n122A.D. \n\n\n\nHerodotus Greek \nhistorian of the 5th \ncentury B.C. \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\nGreek name for Goddess-worshipping tribes in north Africa, Anato- \nlia, and the Black Sea area. 1 Due to an erroneous belief that Amazon \nwarriors destroyed the right breast to be unhindered in drawing the \nbow, some derived the name from a-mazos, "breastless." But Greek rep- \nresentations of Amazons showed no such mutilation. The idea may \nhave arisen from Asiatic icons of the Primal Androgyne with a \nmale right half and female left half, echoed by a coalescence of the \nAmazon Goddess Artemis with her brother-consort Apollo. Scholars \nnow say the word Amazon meant "moon-woman." 2 \n\nSuetonius said, "Amazons once ruled over a large part of Asia." As \nlate as the 5th century a.d., the Black Sea was still known as the \nAmazon Sea.* Libya which used to mean all of North Africa except \nEgypt was also Amazonian. Herodotus spoke of Libyan Amazons. \nDiodorus, first century Greek historian, called them "the warlike \nwomen of Libya." To this day, north African Berbers call themselves \nAmazigh, though their common name came from Latin barbari, \n"barbarians." 4 \n\nThe ancients said Amazons were the first to tame horses, which \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\n\nmay well account for their armies\' legendary invincibility. 5 In open \ncountry, mounted troops whether male or female would have a decided \nadvantage over foot soldiers. \n\nIn Amazonian myths, the Goddess was often worshipped as a \nmare: India\'s mare-mother Saranyu, mare-headed Demeter, or \nCretan Leukippe the "White Mare," whose priests were castrated and \nwore female dress. 6 Among Scythians also, men entered the service \nof the Goddess by castrating themselves and adopting women\'s cloth- \ning. The only deity shown in Scythian art was the Great Goddess, \nwhom the Greeks called Artemis, or Hestia, or Gaea (the Earth). 7 \nSome of the Scythians settled in Parthia, "Virginland," named after \ntheir Goddess. They came to be known as Sacae, and their chief city \nwas Sacastene, now Seistan. 8 \n\nScythians were governed by priestess-queens, usually buried alone \nin richly furnished kurgans (queen-graves). Five kurganswere discov- \nered together at Pasyryk in southern Russia in 1954. Scythian \npriestesses were elder women, old enough to have gray hair. They \nperformed traditional sacrifices, catching the blood in sacred cauldrons \nand taking omens from the entrails. They also accompanied their \narmies into battle, to cast spells for victory. 9 \n\nThe moon-sickle used in mythical castrations of gods was a \nScythian weapon. A long-handled form therefore came to be called a \nscythe, and was assigned to the Grim Reaper, who was originally Rhea \nKronia in the guise of Mother Time, or Mother Death the Earth \nwho devoured her own children. Scythian women apparently used such \nweapons in battle as well as in religious ceremonies and agriculture. \nDiodorus said Scythian women "fight like the men and are nowise \ninferior to them in bravery." 10 A Scythian girl was allowed to marry \nonly after she had killed three enemies in battle. 11 \n\nIt wasn\'t unusual for barbarian armies to include women. Femi- \nnine magic power was often considered necessary for victory. The \nBible says Barak commanded an army of 10,000 men, but refused to go \ninto battle unless the priestess-queen Deborah went along, to cast \nvictory spells for him (Judges 4:8). Tacitus told of druidic forces \nrepelling Roman invaders on the island of Mona (Moon) in 61 a.d.: \namong the soldiers, black-clad women waved swords and cursed the \nenemy "like the Furies." 12 \n\nGreek myth says Amazon tribes occupied Cappadocia, Samo- \nthrace, and Lesbos, and founded the cities of Smyrna, Ephesus, \nCymes, Myrine, and Paphos all leading centers of Goddess-worship. \nAmazons came to the aid of matriarchal Troy in the Trojan War. \nThe Amazon queen Penthesileia fell beneath the sword of Achilles, \nwho immediately violated her dead body. Homer attributed this \nnecrophilic act to Achilles\'s love of her beautiful corpse. More likely, it \nwas a magic charm to immobilize her vengeful spirit. Greeks feared \nthe ghosts of slain Amazons. They called them Beautiful Ones, built \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\n\n\nCornelius Tacitus \n\nRoman historian \nand rhetorician, ca. \n56-120 a.d. \n\n\n\n25 \n\n\n\nAmazons \n\n\n\nLebor Gabala \nErenn, also called the \nBook of Conquests: \nearly-medieval Irish \nhistory, purporting to \ntrace the origins of \nthe Irish tribes back to \nthe time of Adam. \n\n\n\nshrines to them, and offered them propitiatory sacrifices for centuries \nafter the war. 13 \n\nTheseus, king of Attica, violated the Amazons\' law of matrilocal \nmarriage by kidnapping their queen, variously named Hippolyta, \nAntiope, or Melanippe (Black Mare). Some said Antiope was the sister \nof Hippolyta. The former was slain by Theseus, the latter by \nHeracles, who wished to steal her magic girdle. Enraged, the Amazons \ninvaded Greece, ravaged coastal towns, and besieged Athens. 14 \nAmazons and Greeks became hereditary enemies. A later Amazon \nqueen named Artemisia (Spirit of Artemis) joined Xerxes to fight the \nGreeks at the battle of Salamis in 480 b.c. not because she loved \nPersians, but because she hated Greeks. 15 \n\nGreek myths mention several Islands of Women, where Amazons \nlived without men, only consorting with neighboring colonies of \nmales at certain seasons when they wanted to conceive their children. \nTaurus, Lemnos, and Lesbos were said to be such all-female societ- \nies. The Greeks apparently feared them. They said the women of \nTaurus sacrificed to their Goddess all men who landed on their \nshores; and the women of Lemnos had risen up against their husbands \nand murdered all of them at once. 16 The Greek writers seemed to \nhave no doubt that women could destroy whole populations of adult \nmales, and there was no effective defense against them. \n\nNorthern Europe had mythical Amazons: the Valkyries, warrior- \nmaidens of Valhalla. There were also real Amazons among the \nVikings: female captains and war-chieftainesses. 17 In the 10th century \na.d. a Norwegian fleet invaded Ireland and devastated Ulster and the \nnortheast, under the command of a warrior queen called the Red \nMaiden. 18 Another warrior queen, Olga, was one of the first rulers of \nKiev. 19 Medieval historians said Amazons ruled the city of Ulm from \nbefore the time of Abraham to the time of Alexander the Great. The \ncity was named for the sacred elms (ulmae) of the grove where they \nworshipped Diana-Artemis. 20 \n\nAgain and again, legends mention the women\'s magic battle-cries, \nwhich made their enemies helpless. The Valkyrie Kara deprived her \nenemies of power to wield their weapons by the sound of her voice. 21 A \nCeltic Valkyrie, Nemhain, cursed Cu Chulainn\'s warriors and made \na hundred of them drop dead on the spot. 22 \n\nThe Lebor Gabala Erenn Book of the Taking of Ireland said \nthe very first expedition of colonists to Ireland was led by a woman. 23 \nIreland had female soldiers up to the 7th century a.d., when Christian \nlegal reforms forbade women to bear arms. 24 The tradition persisted \nin connection with weddings. A bride\'s costume up to the 17th century \nincluded a knife at the belt. 25 But after the 9th century, female \nwarriors in Celtic lands were labeled "witches." 26 In the Amazons\' \nterritory around the Black Sea, women retained certain Amazon \n\n\n\n26 \n\n\n\ncustoms up to the 18th century: dressing in men\'s clothes, riding Ambrosia \n\nhorseback astride, and fighting beside the men in war. 27 Amphitrite \n\n1.

In the Acts of the Apostles, Ananias \nwas (1) a holy man, Paul\'s instructor, who accepted Paul\'s faith; (2) an \nenemy, who struck Paul and publicly shamed him; and finally (3) "a \nliar unto God," who held back some of his money from the apostles, \nthough they seemed to think he must surrender all of it. For this \noffense, St. Peter made Ananias "fall down dead" along with his wife \nSapphira, and young men of the apostles\' sect buried them. The \napostles were imprisoned for murder, but "an angel" came secretly at \nnight and let them out of jail (Acts 5:1-19). \n\nThis curious story was much repeated in connection with collec- \ntion of church taxes. Withholders of tithes were called "liars" like \nthe sinful Ananias. \n\n\n\nAnaximander \n\nMilesian philosopher, \nastronomer, and \ngeographer, 6th \ncentury B.C. \n\n\n\nAnanke \n\n"Necessity," a Neoplatonic-Pythagorean title of the Goddess who \ngoverned the world according to karmic law; another name for Fortuna, \nor Fate. "What we call causality in the West has its roots in the \nGreek images of Ananke (Necessity), Dike (Justice), Heimarmene \n(Allotted Fate), and Nemesis (Retribution) all goddesses which \nwere feared and respected." Anaximander said it was according to \nAnanke that the "source of generation for all things is that into which \ntheir destruction also leads." Stoic philosophers made Ananke or Hei- \nmarmene the supreme all-ruling world principle, with absolute \nauthority over even the gods. The Orphics said Ananke was mated to \nChronos (Time), which gave rise to the concept of supernatural \nduality known as Time-and-Fate. 1 It might be said there was no Greek \n\n\n\n28 \n\n\n\nidea of "God" that could transcend or overrule the feminine image of \nAnanke as the inescapable What-Must-Be. \n\n\n\n1. von Franz, 23. \n\n\n\nAnanta \nAnath \n\n\n\nAnanta \n\n"The Infinite," a great serpent in whose coils Hindu gods spent their \nperiods of sleep or death between periods of activity. 1 The serpent \nmight be compared to the ancient Egyptian goddess Mehen the \nEnveloper, a serpent who enfolded Ra every night when he was "dead" \nin the underworld. The sex of the eternal serpent was indeterminate. \nEarlier myths tended to see it as female, a cosmic Kundalini. Later \nVedic traditions tended to view Ananta as male. \n\nl.O\'Flaherty,221,340. \n\n\n\nAnastasia, Saint \n\n"She Who Stands in Heaven," title of Rome\'s Great Goddess, \npersonified as a pseudo-saint. Her three "serving-maids" Agapeta, \nTheonia, and Irene were originally the three Horae or Graces who \nattended the Goddess. \n\nHer Christianized legend associated Agapeta, Theonia, and Irene \nwith a man who suffered a ceremonial death in the same way as \nancient victims of the pagan Mamuralia or scapegoat-sacrifice. He was \nbeaten with rods, reviled and spat upon, then shown a vision of the \nTriple Goddess in his moment of death, whereupon he "fell into a sleep \nso deep" that no further blows could waken him. 1 \n\nHagiographers claimed Anastasia was another one of the "virgin \nmartyrs" slain by Diocletian\'s persecution. However, modern schol- \nars admit that she never existed except as a label on statues of the \nGoddess, which were re-interpreted as images of a saint. 2 Her holy \nday was the same as that of the sun\'s birth from the Great Mother at the \nwinter solstice: December 25. By the old lunar calendar, this festival \nbegan with its Eve, December 24, called Matrum Noctem, "Night of \nthe Mother." 3 \n\nl.deVoragine ( 52. 2. Attwater, 44. 3.

Greek- \nspeaking Phoenicians in Cyprus called her "Anat, Strength of Life." \nAn Egyptian stele of the time of Rameses II addressed her as Queen of \n\n\n\nvar. Anatha, Anat, \nNeit, or Ath-enna; \nEgyptian: Aynat \n\n\n\n29 \n\n\n\nAnath \n\n\n\nRas Shamra texts \n\nCuneiform tablets \ndiscovered in 1929 in \nthe Ras Shamra \nmound, northern Syria, \nsite of the ancient \nCanaanite capital city of \nUgarit. The texts \nreveal Canaanite \nfoundations of biblical \nmaterial. \n\n\n\nHeaven and Mistress of All the Gods. Under the Greek Ptolemaic \ndynasty she ruled both Egypt and Palestine. Semitic texts named her \nVirgin Daughter of Palestine, or Virgin Wisdom Dwelling in Zion. 1 \n\nThe Jerusalem temple was occupied for centuries by both God \n(El) and this Goddess, variously known as Queen of Heaven, Anat, \nAsherah, Mari, or Miriam. 2 Her sanctuary Beth-Anath (House of \nAnath) is mentioned in the 19th chapter of Joshua. Some early \nIsraelite chieftains called themselves her sons, like Shamgar ben Anath, \nwho "slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad" \n(Judges 3:3 1). The ox goad was a magic spell, represented by the letter \nlamedh, which means "ox goad." In Sicily, a Phoenician settlement \nwas named after this Goddess, Mach-Anath. Greeks called it Panorma, \nmeaning Universal Mountain Mother. 3 \n\nPrimitive sacrificial rites of Anath or Anat were described in the \nRas Shamra texts. She was fertilized by the blood of men, not by their \nsemen, because her worship dated all the way back to the Neolithic \nwhen fatherhood was unknown and blood was considered the only \nsubstance that could transmit life. Hecatombs of men seem to have \nbeen sacrificed to Anath when her image was reddened with "rouge \nand henna" for the occasion. 4 "Violently she smites and gloats, Anat \ncuts them down arid gazes; her liver exults in mirth ... for she \nplunges her knees in the blood of the soldiers, her loins in the gore of \nthe warriors, till she has had her fill of slaughtering in the house, of \ncleaving among the tables." 5 In similar rites in Egypt, priestesses hoisted \nup their skirts while dismembering the bull god Apis so his spurting \nblood would bathe their loins and fertilize them. 6 \n\nLike the Mexican "Lady of the Serpent Skirt," who made new life \nfrom Quetzalcoatl\'s genital blood, Anath hung the shorn penises of \nher victims on her goatskin apron, or aegis. 7 When the Goddess was \ntransplanted to Greece and permanently virginized as Athene, her \naegis was transformed from the ceremonial apron of Libyan priestesses \ninto a breastplate. 8 Athene still wore "serpents" (phalli) on her aegis, \nalong with the Gorgon head of her Destroyer aspect. Gorgon, "Grim \nOne," was Athene\'s title as a Death-goddess. 9 See Medusa; Metis; \nNeith. \n\nAnath annually cast her death-curse, anathema, on the Canaanite \ngod who became Lord of Death: Mot, the castrated "Sterility" aspect \nof the fertile Baal. Like Set in Egypt, Mot stood for the barren season \nthat slew its own fertile twin, the god Aleyin. In typical sacred-king \nstyle, Mot- Aleyin was the son of the Virgin Anath and also the \nbridegroom of his own mother. Like Jesus too, he was the Lamb of \nGod. He said, "I am Aleyin, son of Baal (the Lord). Make ready, then, \nthe sacrifice. I am the lamb which is made ready with pure wheat to \nbe sacrificed in expiation." 10 \n\nAfter Aleyin\'s death, Anath resurrected him and sacrificed Mot in \nturn. She told Mot that he was forsaken by his heavenly father El, the \nsame god who "forsook" Jesus on the cross. The words attributed to \n\n\n\n30 \n\n\n\nJesus, "My El, my El, why hast thou forsaken me? " (Mark 1 5:34), Anath \n\napparently were copied from the ancient liturgical formula, which \n\nbecame part of the Passover ritual at Jerusalem. \n\nThe sacred drama included a moment when Anath broke Mot\'s \nreed scepter, to signify his castration again foreshadowing a detail of \nthe Christian Gospels. The breaking of the scepter meant severing the \nconnection of the old, played-out king with the Earth-goddess after \nthe harvest of his reign. Anath therefore slew him and used his body and \nblood to refresh the soil for the next year\'s crop. "She seizes Mot, the \nson divine. With her sickle she cleaves him. With her flail she beats \nhim." His pieces were scattered on the fields, like pieces of the Savior \nOsiris in Egypt. 11 \n\nNaturally, the god-killing Anath was much diabolized in later \npatriarchal legends. Abyssinian Christians called her Aynat, "the evil \neye of the earth." They said she was an old witch destroyed by Jesus, \nwho commanded that she must be burned and her ashes scattered on \nthe wind. 12 The hostility of Jesus probably stemmed from the missionar- \nies\' deliberate reversal of his former identification with the destroyed \ngod. \n\nIn the Christian Gospels, Anath \'s death curse Anathema Mara- \nnatha (1 Corinthians 16:22) has been very loosely translated "the \nBridegroom cometh." It really meant the Bridegroom\'s imminent \ndeath; it was the solemn curse pronounced over any sacrificial \nvictim. 13 It carried the same double meaning as Latin sacer, meaning \nboth "holy" and "accursed" like all dying gods, who were formerly \nanathemata, "offerings." H Every nation has examples of gods chosen \nfor the sacred marriage, then accursed and killed. The Celtic God- \ndess\'s fatal words marked for death such heroes as Cu Chulainn and \nDiarmuid. The god called Lord of the Hunt became le Chasseur \nMaudit, "the Accursed Huntsman." \n\nThe origin of accursed heroes in general might be found in \nancient India, where Shiva the Condemned One was chosen by Sati- \nKali for the sacred marriage with her virgin incarnation, followed by his \ndeath and journey to the underworld. 15 As a personification of the \nPrimordial Abyss, the Goddess was sometimes called Kala-Nath, which \nmight have been related to the name of Anath. 16 \n\nAnath\'s capacity to curse and kill made even the Heavenly Father \nafraid of her. When El seemed reluctant to do her bidding, she \nthreatened to smash his head and cover his gray hair and beard with \ngore. He hastily gave her everything she asked, saying, "Whoever \nhinders thee will be crushed." 17 It was a long step from this Middle- \nEastern tale to the Greek concept of the dread Goddess as the \nHeavenly Father\'s ever-dutiful daughter.

In medieval Christian usage, to \nbe pronounced Anathema was to be cast out of the congregation with \nbell, book, and candle, and irrevocably consigned to hell: a curious \nreminiscence of the accursed god\'s temporary descent into the under- \nworld, in the ancient religion. \n\n\n\nX \n\n\n\nSt. Andrew\'s Cross \n\n\n\nAndrew, Saint \n\nFrom Greek andros, "man" or "virility," a title of the solar god of \nPatras, in Achaea, where the apostle Andrew was supposed to have \nbeen crucified after founding the Byzantine papacy. \' St. Andrew\'s \nlegend was invented by Byzantine bishops to counter Rome\'s claim to \nprimacy through its own legend of St. Peter. Eastern patriarchs \nupheld their magisterium by calling Andrew the elder brother of Peter, \nto enhance his authority, and declaring him the first apostle to \ndiscover the Messiah. 2 \n\nThe story that Andrew was crucified on an X-shaped cross, the \nso-called St. Andrew\'s Cross, was unknown until the Middle Ages. \nApparently it evolved from a popular symbol of the eastern patri- \narchs, a solar cross in an orb. 3 It was also the Cross of Wotan carried by \nNorse invaders into Scotland, where it became the present Scottish \nnational symbol. \n\nPatras, the site of Andrew\'s alleged martyrdom, was an old shrine \nof the phallic-solar father-god variously called Pater, Petra, or Peter, \nwhose name had the same basic meaning as Andrew. Political battles \nbetween the factions of Andrew and Peter in the 4th century a.d. \nstimulated canonical disguises for local genii loci in both Byzantium and \nRome, and these are still preserved in the calendar of saints. 4 \n\nl.Attwater,45. 2.

The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad said the Primal Andro- \ngyne was "of the same size and kind as man and woman closely \nembracing." 1 Some said the male and female elements lived together in \none skin, experiencing constant sexual bliss and spiritual \ncompleteness. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\n\nShiva and Shakti-Kali appeared as the androgyne Ardhanaris- Androgyne \n\nvara, the right side male, the left side female. 2 Rudra, the older form of \n\nShiva, was known as "the Lord Who is Half Woman." 3 Brahma ^_^__^^__ \n\nand Vishnu also appeared as bisexual beings united with their Shaktis. \nChinese Taoists held the mandala of Yang and Yin to represent the \nandrogyne. \n\nWestern myths also assigned androgyny to the elder gods or the \nfirst human beings. The Orphic creation myth said the firstborn deity \nwas a double-sexed Phanes or Eros, "Carnal Love," whose female half \nwas Psyche, the soul, Greek equivalent of Shakti. 4 Hermes owed his \nphenomenal wisdom to his former androgynous existence with Mother \nAphrodite, as double-sexed Hermaphroditus. 5 \n\nOften, the androgyne appeared in myth as male-female twins born \nsimultaneously, e.g. Isis-Osiris, Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, Fauna- \nFaunus, Helen-Helenus, or Artemis-Apollo, the "moon and sun" \nunited in their Mother\'s womb. Probably an androgynous image on \nApollo\'s altar at Delos gave rise to the story that he copulated with his \nsister Artemis on that altar. Several forms of the sun god were \nrepresented as requiring close physical union with the moon goddess, as \neven Brahma was useless without his female counterpart Bhavani, \n"Being." 6 Egypt\'s "supreme" sun god was often an androgyne; the sun \nwas his right eye, the moon his left. 7 The same androgynous being is \nstill worshipped in Dahomey as Nana-Buluku, Moon-Sun, who created \nthe world and gave birth to the first pair of human beings. 8 \n\nMany myths model the first human beings on the androgyne. \nPersians said the first pair in the garden of Heden (Eden) lived \ntogether in one body, until Ahura Mazda separated them. Jewish \nimitators of the Persians also said Adam and Eve were united in a \nbisexual body. Some rabbinical sources said Eve was not "taken out \nof" Adam; they were parted from one another by a jealous God who \nresented their sexual bliss, which was too Godlike for human beings, \nand should be reserved for deities. Casting man out of the "garden" \nmeant detaching him from the female body, often symbolized by the \nHebrew pardes, "garden." 9 This was another way of saying the \noriginal sin that angered God was not disobedience but sex. 10 \n\nGreek myths of the Golden Age told the same tale of a jealous \nGod: Zeus, who punished humanity\'s friend Prometheus with \neternal torture because he tricked the Heavenly Father for human- \nity\'s advantage (see Sacrifice). The people of the Golden Age had been \ncreated androgynous by Prometheus, who made their bodies of clay, \nand Athene, who gave them life. Father Zeus took out his anger on \nthem by tearing them apart. A piece of clay was torn out of the \nfemale part and stuck to the male part. That is why women have an \norifice that bleeds, and men have a loose dangling appendage that \nseems not to belong to them but always craves to return to the female \nbody it came from. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\n\nAndrogyne \n\n\n\nNaassenes, or \n\nNaassians; from \nHebrew nahash, "ser- \npent." Jewish or \nChristian Gnostic sects \nof the early Christian \nera, who worshipped \nthe serpent god \nOphis (Hermes) as a \nform of the Savior. \n\nMysteries General \nterm for religious rites \nof the "secret \ninitiation" type, which \nincluded early \nChristianity. \n\n\n\nCruel Zeus permitted human beings to return the male appendage \nto its female home sometimes, to sense for a brief moment the bliss of \ntheir former bisexual existence. Some Gnostic mystery cults of the first \ncenturies a.d. taught Tantric techniques to prolong the moment of \nbliss, which angered most forms of the Heavenly Father including the \nChristian one, whose bishops denounced this training as schooling \nin wickedness. 11 Church fathers especially deplored making or re- \nmaking the Beast with Two Backs, another term for the Primal \nAndrogyne. \n\nThough orthodox Christianity renounced both sexuality and an- \ndrogyny in religious images, Gnostic Christians used them. As Kali \nwas the female half of Shiva, so the Gnostic Great Mother Sophia was \nthe female half of Christ. This was revealed "in a great light": the \nSavior was shown as an androgyne coupled with "Sophia, Mother of \nAll." 12 \n\nGnostic Christians said those who received the true revelation of \nthe Father-Mother spirit were the only ones prepared for the secret \nsacrament called apolytrosis, "release," a concept identical with Tantric \nmoksha or "liberation." n Obviously influenced by Tantrism or its \nprototype, western Gnostics had made a direct translation of the Hindu \nYab-Yum, "Father-Mother," the sexual union of a sage and his \nShakti at the crucial moment of death. 14 Sexual sacraments were in \neffect practicing for that moment, when the enlightened one would \nbe restored to the condition of primordial bliss as an androgynous \ncreature. \n\nThe Naassenes said no enlightenment was possible without the \nFather-Mother spirit, an androgyne sometimes called Heavenly \nHorn of the Moon. 15 In the 5th century a.d., Orphic initiations sought \nto awaken a female spirit within man, to render him sensitive to the \nmessage of the Mysteries. After meeting the deities in a death-and- \nrebirth experience, he carried a bowl, emblem of the womb, and \ntouched his belly like a gravid woman, signifying "a spiritual experience \nuniting the opposed ways of knowledge of the male and female, and \nfused with this idea is that of a new life conceived within." 16 \n\nSuch Gnostic subtleties were disliked by the orthodox, who viewed \nall mergings of the sexes as unequivocally sinful. After Gnostic sects \nwere crushed, the androgyne was consigned to hell and gave birth to \nmany curious devils with both male and female attributes. A 1 6th- \ncentury book showed Satan himself seated on a throne, wearing a papal \ntiara, with bird feet, a female face in his genital area, and pendulous \nfemale breasts. 17 The Devil of the Tarot pack was usually androgynous, \nas were many of the devils represented in cathedral carvings. \n\n1.0\'Flaherty,34. 2.

Perseus seems to have been a Greek name for Baal in this \n\nmyth, for Baal annually fought Yamm for the love of Mother Astarte, \n\nthe Philistines\' Goddess, locally named Atargatis. Baal replaced \n\nYamm, then was himself replaced when the queen tired of him and he \n\nbecame Yamm in his turn. Andromeda on her rock, in the classic \n\nmyth, was transformed from a critical observer of the combat into a \n\nvictim. \n\nThat Perseus played the role of sacred king in the original myth \nis shown by his apotheosis and rising to dwell in the stars. So also \nHeracles was raised to the stars after performing the same feat \nslaying the great sea serpent in order to mate with Hesione, "Queen of \nAsia," probably just another name for Andromeda-Atargatis. 1 \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,224. \n\n\n\nAndrophonos \n\n"Man-slayer," title of the Goddess Aphrodite as a Destroyer or \ndeath-goddess. She was also the Black One, the Goddess of the Tombs, \nand the Queen Bee who killed her lovers as drone bees are killed, by \ncastration and evisceration. She had "many titles which seem inconsist- \nent with her beauty and complaisance." \' That was because classic \nmythographers sought to make her a love goddess only, ignoring her \nearlier character as the creating-and-destroying Triple Goddess (see \nTrinity). \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,71-72. \n\n\n\nAngels \n\nThe earliest angels were heavenly nymphs, like Hindu apsaras, who \ndispensed sensual bliss to the blessed ones. Vikings called them \nValkyries. Greeks called them Horae. Persians called them Houris, or \nPeris (fairies). A guardian angel was a personal Shakti who watched \nover a man and took him into her ecstatic embrace at the moment \nof death. N \n\nHindu angels were created primarily for lovemaking. They had no \nmenstruation, pregnancy, birth, or nursing, though they were moth- \ners. Each child appeared miraculously on its mother\'s knee at the age of \nfive years. Apsaras could copulate endlessly with gods without any \nemission of fluids or loss of energy. Such a being was "the perfect \ndispenser of sensual delight and amorous bliss on a divine scale." 1 \nLike the queen of the Holy Grail palace in bardic romance, the angel \nwas a "Dispenser of Joy." (See Grail, Holy.) \n\n\n\n35 \n\n\n\nAngerona \n\n\n\nMagic Papyri \n\nCollections of \nexorcisms, invocations, \ncharms, and spells \nwidely circulated during \nthe early Christian \nera, used as bases for \nlater grimoires and \nHermetic texts. \n\n\n\nThere were earthy angels too, the dakinis, "Skywalkers." Tantric \nwritings said they lived in the Palace of Lotus Light. They were \nsometimes called prostitutes\' daughters, or yoginis, i.e., yoga- \npriestesses. 2 \n\nAlthough such angels seemed to be every man\'s wish fulfillment, \npatriarchal religions denied the sexuality of angels. Moslems rejected \nthe Houris (heavenly "whores"), and insisted the angels are without \ncarnal desires. 3 Yet this contradicted the teaching of the Koran, that \nafter death every hero would receive beautiful girls as heavenly \ncompanions. 4 \n\nEuropean Christianity consigned the formerly divine Horae to \nFairyland, the earthly paradise distinguished from the celestial one. \nThe place was called locus voluptatis terrestis, the Terrestrial Place of \nPleasure, or pratum felicitatus, the Paradise of Joy. 5 \n\nAngels were often confused with seraphs and cherubs. The former \nwere six-winged fiery flying serpents, the lightning-spirits of Chalde- \nan myth. The latter were Semitic kerubh, from Sheban mu-karrib, \n"priests of the moon"; sometimes they could take the form of birds. \nAngels accompanying the Hindu Great Goddess were able to fly on the \nwings of garuda birds. 6 \n\nBiblical angels were "sons of God" who came to earth to beget \nchildren on mortal women (Genesis 6:4). Later these were called \ndemons, or incubi, or "fallen" angels. The Book of Enoch blamed \nwomen for the angels\' fall. Women had "led astray the angels of \nheaven." 7 In the Magic Papryi, the words angel, spirit, god, and demon \nwere interchangeable. 8 When St. Paul said women\'s heads must be \ncovered in church "because of the angels" (1 Corinthians 1 1:10), he \nmeant the daemones (demons) supposed to be attracted to women\'s \nhair. The Greeks thought each person had an individual guardian angel \nor daemon which could appear in animal form, and under Christian- \nity evolved into the "familiar spirit." There were no really well-defined \ndistinctions between angels, demons, familiars, fairies, elves, saints, \ngenii, ancestral ghosts, or pagan gods. 9 Among supernatural beings one \nmight always find many hazy areas of overlapping identities, even \n"good" or "evil" qualities being blurred. \n\nA Gallup poll showed in 1978 that over half of all Americans still \nbelieve in angels. 10 \n\n1.

Some said Angerona represented the secret name of Rome, \nwhich it was illegal to pronounce. 1 In all probability she was a pre- \n\n\n\n36 \n\n\n\nRoman title of the same primal Creatress whom Gnostics called Sige, \n"Silence," personifying the lightless and soundless womb that gave \nbirth to the first deities. Gnostics said Silence was the mother of the \nGreat Goddess herself. \n\n1. Larousse, 214. \n\n\n\nAngurboda \nAnkamma \n\n\n\nAngurboda \n\nEddaic "Hag of the Iron Wood," mother of Hel and of the Moon- \ndogs who bore away the dead. Danaans, or Danes, knew her as Anu, \nYngona, Nanna, or "Anna of the Angles." She was a "hag" in the \nancient sense of "Holy One"; the Death-goddess. 1 See Dog. \n\n1. Graves, W.G, 409. \n\n\n\nAnima \n\nFemale soul, from the roots an, "heavenly," and ma, "mother," \nrecalling a time when all souls were supposed to emanate from the \nHeavenly Mother. 1 In the 16th century a.d. Guillaume Postel said \nevery soul had male and female halves, the animus and anima. The \nmale half had been redeemed by Christ, but the female half was still \nunredeemed and awaited a female savior. 2 This was a new development \nof the old Christian view that only males had any souls at all. The \nthird canon of the Council of Nantes in 660 a.d. had decided that all \nwomen are "soulless brutes." 5 \n\nAlchemists applied the word anima to all "spirits" considered \nfemale: Anima Mercury, Anima Mundi, etc. The Spirit of the World \nwas connected with the elements of earth and water, like Eleusinian \nDemeter, "Mistress of Earth and Sea." One reason alchemists were \nsuspected of heresy was their notion that the World-Soul was a female \nanima. \n\nCarl Jung revived the terms animus and anima to describe reason- \ning and intuitive parts of the mind (i.e., left and right hemispheres). \nEvery person\'s anima is "often symbolically connected with both earth \nand water. She is pictured as timeless and profoundly wise. . . . Each \nman\'s first and formative experience of the anima is with his mother. \nHer true function in the mind, according to Jung, is creativity." 4 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 410. 2.

Its other name \nwas Key of the Nile, because the sacred marriage between God and \nGoddess was supposed to take place at the source of the Nile each year \nbefore the flood. The Christian version of the Cross of Life, which \ndidn\'t appear in Christian art until after the 5th century a.d., sig- \nnificantly lacked the feminine oval and kept only the masculine part \nof the figure. 1 \n\nThe ankh seems to have evolved from an ancient symbol of the \nGoddess in Libya and Phoenicia: a narrow triangle surmounted by \na crossbar and a round or oval head. 2 \n\nt Egyptians regarded the ankh as a universal life-charm. "The life of \n\nevery being, divine or human, depended on his or her possession of \nit. From first to last the gods are seen carrying it in their right hands, and \nthey gave life to their kings and servants presenting it to them." 3 \nEarly Christians also used the ankh occasionally as an emblem of \n\nimmortality, calling it an ansated cross. They knew the Egyptians had \n\nAnkh a certain letter-hieroglyph that "stood for the life to come; and this letter \n\nhad the form of a cross." 4 In hieroglyphics the ankh stood simply for \nthe word "life." 5 \n\nI.

The name meant Lady of Heaven. See Anne, Saint. \n\n\n\nAnnapurna \n\nHimalayan mountain called Great Breast Full of Nourishment; a \nmanifestation of the Great Goddess as the home and support of the \ngods. \n\n\n\nAnne, Saint \n\nMythical mother of the virgin Mary, from the Middle-Eastern \nGoddess Anna, or Hannah, or Di-Ana, mother of Mari. From Sumeria \nto pre-Roman Latium she was known as Anna, the Grandmother- \nGoddess; Anatha in Syria, Anat in Canaan, Ana or Anah in several Old \nTestament transformations. Long before the Bible was written, the \nGoddess Anna was already known as the Grandmother of God. Hence, \n\n\n\n38 \n\n\n\nthe choice of her name for the mother of God\'s Mother is hardly Anne, Saint \n\nsurprising. 1 \n\nSyriac versions of the Book of James said God\'s Grandmother was ^^^^^^^^ \nnot Anna but Dinah, actually the same name, a Semitic Di-Ana or \n"Goddess Ana." Dinah was the ancestress of Dinaite tribes who settled \nin Sumeria (Ezra 4:9). As Anatha, she was the consort of Yahweh at \nElephantine. 2 As Anna Perenna she was Grandmother Time to the \nRomans, mother of the Aeons. As Ana or Anu she ruled Celtic \ntribes. As Nanna, she was an incarnation of Freya in the mother-bride of \nBalder. In Phrygia too, she was Nana, mother of the Savior. She was \nreally as old as the oldest civilization. A Sumerian prayer declared: \n"Hear O ye regions, the praise of Queen Nana; magnify the \nCreatress, exalt the dignified, exalt the Glorious One, draw nigh unto \nthe Mighty Lady." 3 \n\nRomans worshipped the Goddess as Anna Perenna, "Eternal \nAnna," mother of the Aeons. She stood at the change of years, a two- \nheaded Goddess of Time with two faces named Prorsa and Postverta, \nlooking forward and backward from her heavenly gate among the \nstars, where one celestial cycle merged into the next. So she stood for \nboth Alpha and Omega, beginning and end. Under the name of \nCarmenta she invented all the letters in between. 4 She was also Jana, or \nJuno, mother of the January New Year. Classical myths masculin- \nized her as the two-faced Janus, god of gateways. Christians may have \nconfused icons labeled IANA with the mother of the Virgin; for Jana- \nJuno was the virgin mother of the savior-god Mars. \n\nOvid said Anna was the same as the Moon-goddess Minerva. \nSappho named her "the Queen." 5 To the Celts, she was the same as \ntheir Ana, first of the female trinity of the Morrigan, associated with the \nCauldron of Regeneration. Her moon-temple used to stand at Cnoc \nAine in Limerick, now a shrine of "St. Anne." 6 To Irish pagans, Ana \nmeant "mother." It also came to mean wealth, plenty, treasure. 7 \n\nAs Grandmother-goddess, Ana could be a destroying Crone. \nSome myths called her Morg-ana, "Invincible Queen Death." Medi- \neval Christians called her Anna of the Angles, or Black Annis, or \nAngurboda, the Hag of the Iron Wood, mother of Hel. 8 The magic \npentacle was the sign of Morg-ana. 9 A similar five-pointed star stood for \nthe underworld in Egyptian hieroglyphics. 10 This same star was the \nofficial sigil of St. Anne. 11 \n\nIn her Christianized form, Anne had three husbands, gave birth to \nmany saints, and became the patron of midwives and miners. Neu- \nmann says, "All this bears witness to her original fertility aspect as Earth \nMother." n \n\nSt. Anne was of crucial importance in the dogma of the virgin \nMary\'s immaculate conception, adopted as an article of faith in \n1854, after seven centuries of controversy. 13 In the official Catholic \nview, original sin was transmitted by sexual acts. Therefore, so Mary \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\n\nAntic Hey \nAntichrist \n\n\n\nJohannes Trithemius \n\n15th-century \nGerman scholar, Abbot \nof Sponheim \n\n\n\ncould be born without taint of original sin, St. Anne herself had to be in- \nnocent of sexuality. Accordingly, Johannes Trithemius proclaimed \nthat Anne "was chosen by God for her appointed services before the \nfoundation of the world. She conceived \'without the action of man,\' \nand was as pure as her daughter." H \n\nAt first the church accepted this doctrine, because it seemed to \nsolve the problem of Mary\'s sinlessness. Later it was rejected. Two \nvirgin births made one too many. In the end, St. Anne was said to have \nconceived Mary in the normal way but the child was freed in the \nwomb of original sin. Though these intimate matters are supposed to be \nknown in minute detail, churchmen incongruously admit that "noth- \ning whatever is known about the parents of the Virgin Mary." 15 \n\n1.

Carnival "antics" were connected with \nthe Old Religions, whose sacred processions were often accompanied \nby clowns deliberately making obscene gestures and jokes to heighten \nthe spirit of revelry. 1 The "hey" was, and is, a figure-eight pattern \npaced on the ground, the sign meaning "infinity" in Hindu-Arabic \nnumeral systems and in their descendant, modern mathematics. \nChoruses of old folk songs call for the hey, in nonsense phrases like \n"Hey, nonny nonny," or "Hey, deny down." Thus the antic hey was \nreally a pagan liturgy in song or dance or both, performed at secularized \nversions of the ancient rites. \n1. Funk, p. 54. \n\n\n\nAntichrist \n\nVirgin-born son of the devil, supposed to appear during the world\'s \nLast Days. Christianity never escaped the patterns of dualism, whereby \neach god had to have an equal and opposite anti-god. Antichrist was \nthe Christian equivalent of Chaldean Aciel, lord of the nether world, \ncounterbalancing the solar god of the heavens. \n\nThe coming of Antichrist has been announced and re-announced \nthroughout the entire Christian era, especially in times of political \nand social stress. His title has been laid on Nero, Attila, Genghis Khan, \nMerlin, Frederick II, and many others including several popes. More \nrecently, Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, and Hitler were all nominated for \nthe position. See Doomsday. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n\n\nAntinomianism \n\nGeneral term for Christian sects that followed the original doctrine of \napotheosis, believing they could become "one with Christ." Like their \npagan contemporaries, many early Christians thought the only route \nto immortality was deification, and the object of their Mysteries was to \nlearn how to be deified. The distinction between men and gods was \nthat men died and gods didn\'t. Thus, one\'s immortality depended on \nbecoming a god, often by sacramental procedures such as eating a \ngod\'s flesh and blood (see Cannibalism). \n\nClement of Alexandria said: "That man with whom the Logos \n\ndwells ... is made like God and is beautiful [T]hat man becomes \n\nGod, for God so wills it [T]he Logos of God became man that from \n\nman you might learn how man may become God. . . . [T]he true \nChristian Gnostic has already become God." l \n\nThis doctrine of deification was soundly based on pagan prece- \ndent. Worshippers of Hermes the Logos believed that "This is the \ngood end for those who have attained knowledge, namely, Deification." \nThey said to Hermes, "Thou art I, and I am thou; thy name is mine, \nfor I am thy image (eidolon)." Mithraists used the same formula, "I am \nthou and thou art I," which the Gospels put in the mouth of Jesus, \n"Abide in me, and I in you" (John 1 5:4). Seneca said, "A holy spirit \ndwells within us." Epictetus wrote: "You are bearing a God with \nyou. ... It is within yourself that you carry him." Cicero said initiation \ninto the Mysteries taught a man he could be God, "inferior in no \nwhit to the celestials." 2 \n\nThe theological pitfall in the concept of salvation through apotheo- \nsis was that identification of self and god led to what Tantric sages \ncalled Svecchacara, "Do As You Will." In effect, the perfected sage \ncould do nothing evil because he was God, and God was incapable of \nsinning. 3 Therefore he was above all man-made laws, and could do \nas he pleased. \n\nGreek democracy was based on a related idea that through \nenlightenment and reason each citizen would become capable of self- \ngovernment and would make no moral errors. This did not apply to \nslaves, women, or those who owned no property; such were not \nclassed as citizens. Mature male landowners however could become \nidiotae, "self-gods." 4 Thus the word "idiot" began in Greek with the \nsense of "one who will not be governed," that is, one who believed the \ndivine will dwelt in himself. \n\nNumerous medieval Christian sects took the Antinomian route to \nsalvation, believing that, like eastern sages, they could become one \nwith the divine. These mystics "in their identification with God sup- \nposed that upon their conscious union with Him they were exempt \nfrom the rules governing ordinary men." Leaders like Amalric of Bena, \nJohann Hartmann, sects like the Alumbrados, Illuminates, Adamites, \nand others taught that when their flesh was occupied by the holy spirit \n\n\n\nAntinomianism \n\n\n\nClement of \nAlexandria (Titus \nFlavius Clemens) \nChristian presbyter and \nteacher of the late \n2nd century a.d., once \nreckoned a saint, but \nremoved from the \ncanon of saints in \n1586 by Pope SixtusV. \n\nAlumbrados, \n\n"Enlightened Ones" \nSpanish heretics of \nthe 15th to 17th \ncenturies, recruited \nfrom reform \nmovements among \nthe Jesuits and \nFranciscans. They \nwere eventually \nexterminated by the \nInquisition. \n\nIlluminati or \n\n"Perfectibilists" \nBavarian secret \nsociety founded by \nAdam Weishaupt, a \nformer Jesuit. The \nsociety was banned \nin 1785. \n\nAdamites 18th- \ncentury sectaries who \nbelieved nakedness \nrepresented the natural \nstate of innocence in \nwhich Adam dwelt \nbefore he "fell" into \nsin, and began to clothe \nhimself. \n\n\n\n41 \n\n\n\nAnubis they could commit no sins of the flesh. For them, sexual promiscuity \n\nwas only a natural "embracing of God." 5 \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Brothers and Sisters of the Free Spirit undertook to demonstrate \n\nthe redemptive virtues of sexuality, nakedness, and scorn of the \nconventions. The more openly they displayed their hippie-like beha- \nviors, the more closely they approached the divine essence. Frazer \nremarked, "Their progress toward this mystic communion was acceler- \nated by the Inquisition, and they expired in the flames, not merely \nwith unclouded serenity, but with the most triumphant feelings of \ncheerfulness and joy." 6 They had their own martyr, a literary sister \nwho wrote the gospel of their sect, The Mirror of Free Souls. She and \nher book both were excommunicated and burned in 1 3 10 a.d. 7 \n\nAntinomian ideas were often defined as heresy, as in the case of \nSimon Morin, who seems to have had fairly standard delusions of \ngrandeur. He said he was the incarnate second coming of Christ, and \nwas incapable of committing a sin; anything he did must be wor- \nshipped. The church disagreed, and burned him as a witch. 8 \n\nThe usual Antinomian excuses for sexual self-expression infiltrated \na group of nuns in the Dominican convent of St. Catherine de Prato. \nEarly in the 19th century, a text of the official inquiry into this case was \npublished in Brussels, then "withdrawn at the insistence of the Papal \nCourt. The second edition is . . . much expurgated." One of the nuns \nexpounded on her Antinomian teachings: "It is sufficient to elevate \nthe spirit to God and then no action, whatever it be, is sinful. . . . Love \nof God and one\'s neighbor is the whole of the commandments. Man \nwho unites with God by means of woman satisfies both command- \nments. So also does he who, lifting his spirit to God, has enjoyment \nwith a person of the same sex or alone. ... In doing that which we \nerroneously call impure is real purity ordained by God, without \nwhich man cannot arrive at a knowledge of Him." 9 \n\nSuch ideas were typically Oriental, as opposed to the Christian idea \n\nof entering into a relationship with a God who was an external \n\n"other." Though the Gospels said "the kingdom of God is within you" \n\n(Luke 17:21), orthodox Christianity treated this as a heretical idea. 10 \n\n1. Angus, 106. 2. Angus, 102, 108, 1 10, 1 12. 3.

Mated to Nephthys, the underground aspect of Isis, Anubis \nwas sometimes known as the Great Dog. He was considered essential to \nthe worship of Isis and Osiris. Plutarch said he had "a power among \n\n\n\n42 \n\n\n\nthe Egyptians much like that of Hecate among the Greeks, he being ter- \nrestrial as well as Olympic Those that worship the dog, have a \n\ncertain secret meaning that must not be revealed.

Her symbol was the cowrie, always emblematic of \nfemale genitals. Her union with the ithyphallic god was supposed to \nbring life-giving Nile waters to the land. She "clasped" a number of \ngods, including in the 5 th century b.c. the Hebrew Jehovah. 1 \n\nLike Kali Ma in India, Anuket had four arms, representing union \nbetween male and female principles. The general pattern for such \ndeities was that two arms held symbols of the male elements, and two \nheld symbols of the female elements. Yet she was known as "The \nOne." She was "self-begotten and self-produced, and whilst yet a virgin \ngave birth to the sun god." 2 \n\nAt the Festival of the Inundation, Egyptians sang to her: "Thou \nart the bringer of food, thou art the mighty one of meat and drink, \nthou art the creator of all good things. Thou fillest the storehouses; thou \nheapest high with corn the granaries, and thou hast care for the poor \nand needy." 3 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 405; Lamusse, 37. 2. Budge, D.N., 159. 3.

However, the Serpent was a common \npersonification of the Egyptian underworld or Tuat itself. The realm \nof darkness with its various "chambers" was the interior of the serpent\'s \nbody, through which the sun god must pass, as he was always \nswallowed at each sunset. 1 \n\nIn medieval alchemy the "Apophis-snake" was confused with the \nHermetic Ouroboros, a hidden world spirit in the form of a serpent, \nwho might reveal the secret of the Philosopher\'s Stone. \n\n1.

It has been shown that "In the symbolism of dreams and of \nmyths the hat is usually the phallus." 2 \n\nThe Flamen\'s wife, the Flaminica, represented the Goddess. She \nwas the more important dignitary of the two. If his marriage was \nterminated by her death, the Flamen immediately lost his sacred office \nand reverted to a private citizen. Such customs show that the powers \nof priests "in Rome as elsewhere, derived in the first instance from an \nolder priesthood of magical women." 3 \n\nThe same conical cap belonged to the Lord of the Underworld in \nCeltiberian pagan imagery. He was Helman: a man belonging to the \nGoddess Hel. 4 Sometimes he was said to be the god Frey, consort of \nHel\'s heavenly or lunar aspect, Freya. 5 \n\nThe same conical cap evolved into the traditional headdress of sor- \ncerers and witches; the Fool\'s Cap (or Dunce Cap) worn by the \nCarnival King; the bishop\'s miter; the pope\'s tiara; and before them all, \nthe conical crown of Egyptian pharaohs, emblem of the king\'s union \nwith the Sky-goddess.

Like Kali, she was a Virgin-Mother-Crone \ntrinity. She was once indistinguishable from the Fates (Moirai); her \nold name was Moira, and she was said to be older than Time. She gov- \nerned the world by ius naturale, the natural law of the maternal clan. 1 \n\nShe was not only Greek. She was the Dea Syria, also known as \nAsherah or Astarte, Goddess of the oldest continuously-occupied \ntemple in the world. 2 She was the ancestral mother of the Romans, for \nshe gave birth to their founding father, Aeneas. 3 Under the name of \nVenus, she was the mother of the Venetii, whose capital city became \nVenice, called "Queen of the Sea" after the Goddess herself. \n\nOne of Aphrodite\'s major centers of worship was the city of \nPaphos on Cyprus, the island named for its copper mines. Thus, she \nwas called "the Cyprian" or "the Paphian," and her sacred metal was \ncopper. She was also called Mari, the Sea. Egyptians referred to her \nisland as Ay-Mari. 4 \n\nDuring the Christian era, Aphrodite\'s temple on Cyprus was \nconverted into a sanctuary of the virgin Mary, another name of the \nsame Goddess, but in this sanctuary the virgin Mary is hailed to this day \nas Panaghia Aphroditessa, "All-holy Aphrodite." 5 \n\n\n\n44 \n\n\n\nContinued worship of the goddess on Cyprus probably contributed Apis \n\nto the Christian belief that the whole population of Cyprus descend- \ned from demons. 6 In reality, Cyprian Aphrodite was like all other ^^^^^^^^ \nmanifestations of the Great Goddess: ruling birth, life, love, death \ntime, and fate, reconciling man to all of them through sensual and \nsexual mysticism. The Cyprian sage Zenon taught Aphrodite\'s phi- \nlosophy: "mankind and the universe were bound together in the system \n\nof fate Diogenes Laertios tells us that Zenon was the first to \n\ndefine the end of human existence as \'life in accordance with nature.\' " 7 \n\nAphrodite had almost as many "emanations" as Thousand-Named \nKali. She was not only Mari and Moira and Marina and Pelagia and \nStella Maris, all titles related to her control of the sea; she was also \nIlithyia, Goddess of childbirth; Hymen, Goddess of marriage; Venus, \nGoddess of sexuality and the hunt; Urania, Queen of Heaven; Andro- \nphonos, the Destroyer of Men; and many others. She was often \nidentified with Isis. Anchises, her lover who begot Aeneas and then was \ncastrated, had a name meaning "he who mates with Isis." 8 Under \nseveral of her names, Aphrodite mated with Semitic gods. Her cult \noccupied the main temple in Jerusalem after 70 a.d. In the 4th \ncentury it was said that Constantine\'s mother found the true cross of \nChrist buried in Aphrodite\'s Jerusalem temple. (See Cross.) \n\nOne of Aphrodite\'s greatest shrines in Asia Minor was the city of \nAphrodisias, once dedicated to Ishtar. Up to the 12th century a.d., \nwhen the city was taken by Seljuk Turks, the Goddess was worshipped \nthere as the patron of arts and letters, crafts, and culture. 9 Recent \nexcavations have uncovered exquisite artifacts and statuary, bespeaking \na cultivated and sophisticated lifestyle under the Goddess\'s rule. 10 \n\nThe calendar still keeps the name of Aphrodite on the month \ndedicated to her, April (Aphrilis). The ancient Kalendar of Romulus \nsaid this was the month of Venus. 11 \n\n1. Bachofen, 57, 192. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Byblos." 3. Graves, G.M. 1, 69. \n4. Graves, W.G., 410. 5. Ashe, 192. 6.

Apis was begotten in bull form when moon- \nbeams fell on a cow in heat. He was identified by special markings, \nnotably symbols of the Goddess: a triangle on his forehead, a flying \nvulture on his side, a crescent moon on his flank. After death each Apis \nbull was elaborately embalmed and buried in the vast underground \nbull-tombs. 1 In mummy form, like all Egyptian gods, he became "an \nOsiris." \n\n\n\n1 . Larousse, 44. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n45 \n\n\n\nApollo Apollo \n\nGreek sun god who took over the powers of his twin sister Artemis, \n^^^^^^^^^^^ the Moon. Originally, he was her child, as the sun was born of \n\nthe Moon-goddess in Egypt and elsewhere. He was also her totemic \nbeast in several forms: a wolf (Apollo Lycaeus), a mouse (Apollo \nSmintheus), or a golden-maned lion (Apollo Chrysocomes). \n\nThe fully anthropomorphized Apollo laid claim to the Goddess\'s \npowers of prophecy, poetry, music, magic, and healing. His priest- \nhood adopted the Muses, the Graces, even the Great Serpent who gave \noracles from the earth-womb, Apollo Python, known as Sol Niger \n(Black Sun) during his nightly sojourn in the underworld. Egyptians \ncalled him Apep or Apophis, the serpent of darkness. In the Bible he \nis Apollyon, "Spirit of the Pit" (Revelation 9:1 1). \n\nApollo\'s serpent-form inspired the Pythoness, priestess of the \nDelphic oracle, Greece\'s foremost temple of prophecy. This temple \nbelonged to the Goddess in the beginning; delphi means womb. Even \nApollo\'s priests admitted that she had owned the oracle in her \ntrinitarian guise as mother of earth, heaven, and the abyss: the first of all \ndeities to prophesy, the Earth-mother; and Themis, mother of the sea \nand of all Themistes, "oracles"; and the Moon-goddess, Artemis, under \nthe name of Phoebe another title stolen by Apollo, who became \nknown as Phoebus. 1 \n\nApollonian priests naturally directed their energies toward con- \nquest of the oracles. "The reason why a deity associated with political \nconquest and order should take possession of oracular shrines is obvious; \noracles were the chief means of controlling public opinion and public \naction, and to control the oracles was as necessary to a political god as it \nis to later politicians to control the press or education." 2 \n\nLaurel became Apollo\'s sacred plant because it was the plant of \ninspired poetic frenzy, which is why Britain\'s national poet is still \ncalled Laureate, the laurel-crowned one. The Delphic Pythoness \nchewed leaves of cherry laurel to induce her poetic-prophetic trances. \nCherry laurel contains traces of cyanide, enough to cause delirium, \nfoaming at the mouth, and other symptoms of divine possession. \n\nApollo\'s priests used the oracles to create new patriarchal laws, \noverturning the laws of the matriarchate. Apollo\'s most notable \njudicial act was to absolve Orestes from the crime of killing his mother. \nApollo said it was no crime, because a mother is not a real parent; \nonly a father truly gives life to a child, the same "Apollonian" opinion \nlater adopted by Christian theologians. 3 Yet this patriarchal opinion \nwas negated by Apollo\'s own surname of Letoides, "son of Leto." 4 He \ncarried the name of his mother only, after the custom of the matri- \narchal Lycians who recognized strictly matrilineal ancestry, and in \nwhose country Apollo\'s cult first evolved. \n\nIn his earliest manifestations, Apollo was subordinate to the God- \ndess as her dog-faced or wolf-faced door-guardian: a "Spirit of the \nPit" like Apollyon, another name for Anubis or Cerberus. Four Hittite \n\n\n\n46 \n\n\n\naltars found in Anatolia were dedicated to a god named Apulunas, \nGuardian of Gates, forerunner of Apollo Lycaeus or "Wolfish Apol- \nlo." 5 Once he walked at the Goddess\'s heel, like Anubis; but this \nwas suppressed and forgotten. \n\nTo some early Christians, Apollo became a junior God. He was \neven said to have fathered on mortal virgins several pagan sages \nrespected by the church, such as Plato. 6 Healing miracles were widely \nattributed to Apollo. 7 Christians sought his intervention in certain \nillnesses. It was claimed that if a naked virgin touched the afflicted part, \nsaying, "Apollo denieth that the heat of the plague can increase \nwhere a naked virgin quencheth it," the patient would get well. 8 \n\nUnder his title of Benedictus, "Good-speaker," Apollo was even \ncanonized, and became St. Benedict. 9 \n\n1.

When he went through the streets, the people came forth \nto worship him, and every one brought him an alms, with children and \nsick folks, that he might cure them, and bless them, suffering him to do all \nthings at his pleasure, only he was accompanied with ten or twelve men \nlest he should fly. . . . The feast being come, and he grown fat, they killed \nhim, opened him, and ate him, making a solemn sacrifice of him. \' \n\nThis devoured Savior, closely watched by his ten or twelve \nguards, embodied the god Quetzalcoatl, who was born of a virgin, slain \nin atonement for a primal sin, and whose Second Coming was \nconfidently expected. 2 He was often represented as a trinity signified by \nthree crosses, a large one between the smaller ones. 5 Father Acosta \nnaively said, "It is strange that the devil after his manner hath brought a \nTrinity into idolatry." 4 His church found it all too familiar, and long \nkept his book as one of its secrets. \n\nThe Gospels contain hints that Jesus was as reluctant as the \nQuetzalcoatl-victim. Once he ran away from his "apostles" and fled \nalone into the mountains, fearing men would "come and take him by \nforce, to make him a king" (John 6:1 5). That is, he didn\'t want the \nfatal honor of being a sacred king of the Jews, the doomed Bridegroom \nof Zion. The apostles caught up with him in Capernaum, and his \nsubsequent speeches indicate resignation to his fate. \n\nHe said he was the bread of God, come down from heaven to give \nlife to the world: "The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will \ngive for the life of the world Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh \n\n\n\nJose de Acosta \n\n16th-century Spanish \nJesuit missionary who \naccompanied the \nconquistadores, and \nwrote a history of \nnative cultures in Peru, \nBolivia, and Mexico. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\nApotheosis my blood, hath eternal life" (John 6:50, 54). On the eve of the \n\nApple sacrifice he prayed despairingly, "O my Father, if it be possible, let \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ this cup pass from me; nevertheless . . . thy will be done" (Matthew \n26:39, 42). At least the Gospel narrator claims Jesus said this. \n\nNaturally, any sacred king\'s guards would become popularizers of \nhis cult, "dining out" on the divine sayings and actions for years. \nHowever, the Gospels were not written by the apostles whose names \nthey bear. They were forgeries, compiled long after Jesus\'s time, \nsome as late as the middle of the 2nd century. 5 Even this is scholarly \nguesswork, since no authentic manuscript can be dated before the 4th \ncentury. 6 \n\nCanonization of the apostles used an ancient Buddhist symbol, the \nushnisha or "flame of invisible light" appearing on top of their heads. \nTo Buddhists, this flame streaming from the "lotus center" of the skull \nmeant super-intelligence. It appeared over the heads of bodhisattvas. 7 \nThe same phenomenon appeared over the heads of the apostles (Acts \n2:4). The rest of their stories were as mythical as those of the \nbodhisattvas. Guignebert says "not one of them is true. . . . [Tjhere \nexists no information really worthy of credence about the life and \nwork of the immediate Apostles of Jesus." 8 \n\nl.Frazer,G.B.,680. 2.

It became a custom to apotheosize Roman emperors while \nthey were still living. Most other ancient kings were also gods on earth. \nTheir surrogates, the "sacred kings" who died in their place, were \npromised immediate godhood after death. \n\nApotheosis was similarly promised Christian martyrs who perished \nin the belief that they would be wholly assimilated to Christ and \nwould sit "on the right hand of God" like him. The church\'s ritual of \ncanonization was a direct copy of pagan ceremonies of apotheosis. \nThe Roman emperors\' souls winging to heaven as eagles contributed \nthe idea of releasing white doves at the climax of the church\'s \ncanonization ceremony. 1 See Drama. \n\nl.Gaster,769. \n\n\n\nApple \n\nEve\'s fruit of knowledge used to be the Goddess\'s sacred heart of \nimmortality, all over the Indo-European culture complex. The God- \ndess\'s many western paradises grew the apples of eternal life. The \n\n\n\n48 \n\n\n\nCelts called the western paradise Avalon, "Apple-land," a country ruled Apple \n\nby Morgan, the queen of the dead. Irish kings received the Goddess\'s \n\nmagic apples of immortality and went away to live with her under the ^^^^^_^_^^ \n\nsunset. King Arthur was taken to Avalon by the Triple Goddess in \n\nperson, as three fairy queens. \n\nScandinavians thought apples essential to resurrection, and placed \nvessels of them in graves. 1 The Norse Goddess Idun kept the magic \napple-land in the west, where the gods received the fruit that kept them \ndeathless. 2 Apples carried souls from one body to the next. Sigurd\'s \nor Siegfried\'s great-grandmother conceived by eating an apple. 3 The \nYule pig was roasted with an apple in its mouth, to serve as a heart in \nthe next life (see Boar). \n\nGreeks said Mother Hera kept the magic apple garden in the west, \nwhere the Tree of Life was guarded by her sacred serpent. Graves \npoints out that the whole story of Eve, Adam, and the serpent in the \ntree was deliberately misinterpreted from icons showing the Great \nGoddess offering life to her worshipper, in the form of an apple, with \nthe tree and its serpent in the background. Similarly, Hellenes \nmisinterpreted icons of the hero-victim receiving an apple from the \nTriple Goddess, before his journey to paradise, as the Judgment \nof Paris: a picture of a young man receiving the apple from three \nGoddesses, not vice versa. 4 \n\nRomans gave the apple-mother the name of Pomona, which was \nprobably inherited from the Etruscans. She symbolized all fruition. A \nRoman banquet always progressed ab ovo usque mala, from eggs to \napples beginning with the symbol of creation and ending with the \nsymbol of completion. It was recorded that King Herod finished every \nmeal in the Roman style, with an apple. 5 \n\nOne reason for the extreme reverence paid to this fruit is revealed \nby cutting it transversely, as the gypsies and witches did. Hidden in \nthe apple\'s core was the magic pentacle, or sign of Kore (Core). Just as \nKore the Virgin was hidden in the heart of Mother Earth (Demeter) \nand represented the World Soul, so her pentacle was hidden in the \napple. \n\nThe five-pointed star in a circle was the Egyptian hieroglyph for \nthe underworld womb, where resurrection was brought about by the \nmother-heart of "transformations." 6 In Christian iconography also, this \napple-sign represented the Virgin concealed within the Mother, like \nKore within Demeter. (See Anne, Saint.) \n\nAmong gypsies, "occult couples" carefully cut the apple to reveal \nits pentacle and ate it together as magical nourishment during Tannic \nintercourse. 7 A gypsy maiden was supposed to bring about her partner s \nmystic union with the soul of the earth through her own body; thus \nshe was a Shakti, and the apple was her sexual symbol. It was a custom \nfor a gypsy girl to choose her lover by tossing an apple at him, just as \nKali-Shakti chose Shiva to be her doomed bridegroom. 8 \n\nIn Celtic paganism the Goddess\'s apple similarly signified a sacred \n\n\n\n49 \n\n\n\nApple \n\n\n\nVolsungs Teutonic \nclan of demigods \nfavored by Odin, \nwho used a magic apple \nto impregnate the \nmother of the original \nVolsung. His \ndescendant Sigurd is \nbetter known as \nSiegfried, hero of the \nGermanic Ring of \nthe Nibelung. \n\n\n\nmarriage and a journey to the land of death. Queen Guinevere, who \nwas really the Triple Goddess, according to the Welsh Triads, gave a \nmagic apple to "the Irish knight Sir Patrice," actually St. Patrick, \nformerly the father-god or Pater. 9 (See Patrick, Saint.) The Irish \nknight died; Guinevere was denounced as a witch and condemned to \nthe stake, from which Lancelot rescued her. Her offense was choosing a \nsacred king in the ancient ceremonial style. Pre-Christian legends \nshow that each king who ruled Britain had to be chosen by the Triple \nGoddess, and later slain by her Crone form, Morgan, lady of the \nblood-red pentacle and keeper of the Apple-Isle in the west. 10 \n\nHalloween apple-games descended from Celtic feasts of Samhain, \nthe Feast of the Dead at the end of October. Catching at apples \nsuspended from strings, or bobbing in water, may have invoked hanged \nor drowned witches. The games hinted at cheating Death in the form \nof Cerridwen, another name for Morgan as a Sow-goddess. At the end \nof the game, all players ran away "to escape from the black short- \ntailed sow." 11 \n\nHalloween apples were also used for divination, as if they were \noracular ghosts called up from the underworld. Such magic was \nespecially associated with women, harking back to the pagan tradition of \nfemale control of the spirits in that world. The Volsung cycle showed \nthat a man must be provided with "apples of Hel" by his wife, whose \ngift had the power to preserve him when he died and descended \nunder the earth. 12 Thus, Halloween apples were often linked with \nmarriage. One who peeled an apple before a candlelit mirror on \nHalloween would see the image of a future spouse. 13 \n\nApple blossoms were wedding flowers because they represented \nthe Virgin form of the Goddess whose maturity produced the fruit. \nAs the pagan symbols were Christianized, Apple-Eve-Mother-Goddess \nwas said to be reborn as her own younger aspect, Rose-Mary- Virgin- \nGoddess: the five-petaled rose and apple blossom often mystically \ncombined. The red and white Alchemical Rose was an allegory of the \nVirgin Mother. 14 Some mystics said Mary, called the Holy Rose, \nhad invented alchemy. 15 \n\nHowever, the dangerous aspect of apples associated with the \nGoddess as Mother Death were never forgotten. Since she was not \nonly the Virgin and the Mother but also Hel, or Hecate, her apples \nwere often depicted in Christian folklore as poisoned. Churchmen \ndeclared that a witch could cause demonic possession through her gift of \nan apple to her intended victim. 16 Old women were slain for giving \nan apple to a child or other person who later became afflicted with fits. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 187. 2.

The Annals of Ashurbani- \npal said Arabia was governed by queens for as long as anyone could \nremember. 1 The land\'s original Allah was Al-Lat, part of the female \ntrinity along with Kore or Q\'re, the Virgin, and Al-Uzza, the \nPowerful One, the triad known as Manat, the Threefold Moon. 2 \n\nAt Mecca the Goddess was Shaybah or Sheba, the Old Woman, \nworshipped as a black aniconic stone like the Goddess of the Scyth- \nian Amazons. 3 The same Black Stone now enshrined in the Kaaba at \nMecca was her feminine symbol, marked by the sign of the yoni, and \ncovered like the ancient Mother by a veil. 4 No one seems to know \nexactly what it is supposed to represent today. \n\nThe Black Stone rests in the Haram, "Sanctuary," cognate of \n"harem," which used to mean a Temple of Women: in Babylon, a \nshrine of the Goddess Har, mother of harlots. 5 Hereditary guardians \nof the Haram were the Koreshites, "Children of Kore," Mohammed\'s \nown tribe. 6 The holy office was originally held by women, before it was \ntaken over by male priests calling themselves Beni Shaybah, "Sons of \nthe Old Woman." 7 \n\nMohammed\'s legends clearly gave him a matriarchal family \nbackground. His parents\' marriage was matrilocal. His mother remained \nwith her own family and received her husband as an occasional \nvisitor. Mohammed lived with his mother until her death, because she \nwas his true parent according to the ancient system; "children \nbelonged to the woman\'s family . . . paternity in the biological sense was \nrelatively unimportant." 8 She may well have been one of the "aged \npriestesses" who served the temple in Mecca. 9 The traditions of such \npriestesses may well date back to Assyro- Babylonian um-mati or \n"mothers," the only people permitted to enter the Holy of Holies. \nArchaic Arabian shrines were usually served by seven high priest- \nesses, recalling the lawgiving Seven Sages, who were women. 10 The \nfirst collection of the books of law called Koran the Word of Kore, \nor Q\'re was attributed to them. \n\nPre-Islamic Arabia was dominated by the female-centered clans. \nMarriages were matrilocal, inheritance matrilineal. Polyandry \nseveral husbands to one wife was common. Men lived in their wives\' \nhomes. Divorce was initiated by the wife. If she turned her tent to \nface east for three nights in a row, the husband was dismissed and for- \nbidden to enter the tent again. 11 \n\nDoctrines attributed to Mohammed simply reversed the ancient \nsystem in favor of men. A Moslem husband could dismiss his wife by \nsaying "I divorce thee" three times. As in Europe, the change from \nmatriarchate to patriarchate came about only gradually and with \nmuch strife. \n\n\n\nArabia \n\n\n\nAnnals of \n\nAshurbanipal Assyrian \nroyal chronicles on \ncuneiform tablets, \ndating from the 7th \ncentury B.C., found in \nthe king\'s famous \nlibrary at Nineveh by \n19th-century \narcheologists. \n\n\n\nSeven Sages Legendary \nfigures in both Greek \nand Arabian lore, \nidentified with a variety \nof seers and \nphilosophers, the \nearliest ones usually \nfemale, confused with \nthe Seven Sisters, or \nPleiades. \n\n\n\nSI \n\n\n\nArabia \n\n\n\nShi\'ites Minority sect \nof Islam, tracing \ndescent of a sacred \ncaliphate from \nMohammed\'s daughter \nFatima and her \nhusband \'Ali. One line \nof Shi\'ites established \nthe powerful Fatimid \ncaliphate, now \nrepresented by the \nKhojas, Bohras, and \nthe Druze of Syria. \n\n\n\nMany Koreshites remained faithful to the Goddess and to their \nqueen, Hind al-Hunud: the Hind of Hinds, similar to the title of \nArtemis. She was also called Lady of Victory. But her victories came to \nan end with one of the last queens, whose husband betrayed her and \nsurrendered her city of Makkah to the enemy. \n\nLegend claims the step-daughter of the divine Hind married \nMohammed himself. 12 However, the history of early-medieval Arabia \nis nearly all legend. Like Buddha, Confucius, Jesus, and other founders \nof patriarchal religions, Mohammed lacks real verification. There is \nno reliable information about his life or teachings. Most stories about \nhim are as apocryphal as the story that his coffin hangs forever in \nmid-air "between heaven and earth," like the bodies of ancient sacred \nkings. 13 \n\nWith or without Mohammed, Islam succeeded in becoming com- \npletely male-dominated, making no place for women except in \nslavery or in the seclusion of the harem. Islamic mosques still bear signs \nreading: "Women and dogs and other impure animals are not \npermitted to enter." H \n\nNevertheless, traces of the Goddess proved ineradicable. Like the \nvirgin Mary, Arabia\'s Queen of Heaven received a mortal form and a \nsubordinate position as Fatima, Mohammed\'s "daughter." But she was \nno real daughter. She was known as Mother of her Father, and \nSource of the Sun: "the illumination that separates Light and Darkness; \nthe Tree of Paradise; the Red Cow who suckles all the children of the \nearth; Fate; the Night, the World; the Moon; the Pure Essence of \nBeing." 15 Like her western counterpart Mary, she was compared to \nthe Burning Bush, and the Night of Power; "she personified the center \nof the genealogical mystery." 16 \n\nFatima\'s name means The Creatress. A Shi\'a text, Omm-al-Kitab, \nsaid she appeared "at the creation of the material world," crowned, \nseated on a throne, holding a sword, and "ornamented with a million \nvaricolored shimmering lights" which illuminated the entire garden of \nParadise. She was the first to occupy the Seat of Dominion, "the \nresting place of Allah, the Most High." 17 Her symbol as Holy Virgin, \nthe crescent moon, still appears on Islamic flags. 18 She is called Al- \nZahra, "Bright-Blooming," a former title of the Great Mother. It is \nsaid the symbol of her hand, surmounting the solar disc, "represents the \nwhole religion of Islam." 19 \n\nWithin Islam, deviant sects like Shi\'ites or Sufis carried on Tantric \nworship of the female principle, maintaining that the feminine \npowers of sexuality and maternity were the powers that held the \nuniverse together. 20 The greatest medieval poet of Sufism, Ibn al- \nFarid, was known as "the sultan of lovers." 21 He said true divinity was \nfemale, and Mecca was the womb of the earth. As woman-worship- \nping minstrels of medieval Europe were attacked for their devotion to the \nGoddess of Love, so the Sufis were attacked for their "voluptuous \n\n\n\n52 \n\n\n\nlibertinism." Ibn El-Arabi, the "greatest master" of Sufi mystics, was Arabia \n\naccused of blasphemy because he said the godhead is female. 22 \n\nShi\'ites split off from orthodox Islam and claimed to follow a purer ___^_^_^_ \nline of imams directly descended from the Fatimids. In the 1 1th \ncentury they united under Hasan ibn al-Sabbah, i.e., Hasan ben- \nShaybah, another "son of the Matriarch." Hasan seized the fortress \nof Alamut and made it the headquarters of a brotherhood of warriors, \nthe hashishim or "Assassins" (see Aladdin). The fortress fell to the \nconcerted attacks of Mongols and Mamelukes in 1256, after having \nwaged war on Turks and Christian crusaders alike for more than a \ncentury. 23 \n\nStill the Shi\'ite sect survived to the present, awaiting the coming of \nthe Virgin named Paradise (Pairidaeza), who will give birth to the \nMahdi, the "moon-guided" Redeemer, whose title in Europe was the \nDesired Knight. 24 \n\nOne of the hidden secrets of medieval bardic romance is the \nArabian origin of the Waste Land motif, most prominent in the Holy \nGrail cycle of tales. Despite monkish efforts to convert it into a \nChristian chalice, the Grail was generally recognized as a female \nsymbol, whose loss implied fear for the fertility of the earth. Crusad- \ners had seen for themselves the desolation of Arabia Deserta, one of the \nmost lifeless regions on earth. They heard the Shi\'ite heretics\' \nexplanation for it: Islam had offended the Great Goddess, and she \nhad cursed the land and departed. Now nothing would grow there. \n\nWestern mystics thought the same calamity would strike Europe \nif the spirit of the Mother were not brought back from the limbo to \nwhich the Christian church consigned her. This may have been a \nreason for the frenzy of cathedral-building in honor of "Our Lady," the \nQueen of Heaven, during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Waste \nLand theme haunted the collective psyche of the early Renaissance with \na threat of conditions actually realized in the land of the infidel. \n\nTraces of the matriarchate survived to the present among some of \nthe Arabs of North Africa, ancient home of "Libyan Amazons." 25 \nTargi and Tuareg Berber women remained free of many sexual \nrestrictions. Virginity was not prized. On remarriage, a woman could \ncommand twice the bride-price of a young virgin. Men of the \nWalad \'Abdi tribe insisted the success of their crops depended on the \nsexual freedom of their women, whom the French labeled common \nprostitutes. Hassanyeh Arabs of the White Nile allowed wives to be \nunfaithful on certain days of the week, according to the marriage \ncontract drawn up by the bride\'s mother who took pride in preserving \nher daughter\'s sexual liberties. 27 Most of Islam, however, restricted \nwomen as much as possible. Many Islamic theologians said women \ncouldn\'t enter paradise, and must not receive religious instruction \nbecause it might bring them "too near their masters." 28 \n\nl.Assyr. & Bab.

Graves, CM. 1, 347; 2, 381. \n\n\n\nAriana \n\nArchaic name of Iran and its Great Goddess, sometimes rendered \nMariana. \n\n\n\nArianism \n\nEarly Christian heresy founded by Arius in the 4th century a.d. The \nbasic tenet of Arianism was that God was not a trinity but a unit or \nmonad. \n\nOrphics and other mystery-cultists of the early Christian era \nmaintained the classic trinitarian pattern laid down thousands of years \nbefore by the Triple Goddess. They said: "All things are made by one \ngodhead in three names, and this god is all things." From the \nmystery-cults, some Christians picked up the idea that their deity too \nshould be a trinity. Other Christians objected, saying their deity must \nbe a monad like the Jewish Jehovah. St. Augustine found the notion of a \ntrinity incomprehensible. He scoffed at his pagan neighbors for \ncalling their Great Goddess three persons and one person at the same \ntime. 1 \n\nNeither the Old nor the New Testament mentioned a triune God, \nso early Pauline Christians worshipped God as one individual. How- \never, this monotheistic idea was abandoned at the 4th-century Council \nof Nicaea. Arian Christians, clinging to the Hebraic belief in an \nundivided God, suddenly found themselves labeled heretics. In increas- \ningly acrimonious battles, partisans of one viewpoint or the other \nengaged in street fighting with stones and clubs, bloodying their oppo- \nnents to prove the nature of their deity. 2 \n\nArius\'s objections to the Holy Trinity were basically logical. He \ninsisted that a divine son couldn\'t have co-existed eternally with his \nown divine father. There must have been a time when the father existed \nalone, before bringing the son into being. But Arius\'s opponents \nwanted to be assured that, in assimilating the body and blood of Christ \nin communion, they partook of an infinite divinity who had existed \n\n\n\n55 \n\n\n\nArianrhod from the beginning of time. Otherwise they might be robbed of immor- \n\ntality, through unwise identification with a lesser, finite power. \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Therefore they insisted that Christ and God were one and the same. \n\nBesides, pagan traditions universally supported the notion that \ndivine fathers and sons were identical with each other, cyclically \nalternating and united through the Mother. Proponents of the trinitar- \nian theory borrowed myths and symbols from the pagans, and said \nwhen the Magi saw the star in the east announcing Christ\'s birth, three \nsuns appeared in the sky and fused into one. 3 \n\nThe emperor Constantine I at first defended Arius, because he \nliked the idea of a single supreme deity whom he might identify with \nhimself. He also disliked the Christians\' incessant sectarian strife. He \nwrote to Bishop Alexander: "I am sending to you, not simply suggest- \ning, but imploring that you will take these men (the Arians) back . . . \nthat there is peace and concord among you all." 4 This was ignored. \n\nThe Council decided that God, Christ, and the Holy Ghost were \none and the same, forever co-existent, equally potent. Arius was \nanathematized and driven into exile. At last he succumbed to a dose of \npoison, apparently administered by one of his trinitarian opponents. 5 \nBut the battle was not over. The Arian controversy dragged on for \nmany centuries, and spilled much blood, as theological arguments \nwere wont to do in those days. \n\nAfter 360 a.d., Arianism was carried by missionaries to the Ger- \nmanic tribes, whose Christianity remained a vaguely Arian semi- \npaganism up to the time of Charlemagne and beyond. 6 Arianism came \nto the surface again in Hungary and Transylvania during the 16th \ncentury. Christian writers then denied the trinity altogether, starting a \nmovement that led ultimately to the foundation of Unitarian churches. 7 \n\nl.Briffault3,90. 2. de Camp, A.E., 282. 3.de Voragine,49. \n\n4.

In \nMesopotamia and Egypt, the sun god was generally considered a child \n)f the moon-, earth-, sea-, or heaven-goddess. \n\n\n\nArinna \nArk \n\n\n\nVrk of the Covenant \n\n)n its earliest appearances in the Bible, the ark of the covenant was so \nacer (taboo, dangerous) that it would kill at a touch. While it was \neing transported on an oxcart, it teetered "because the oxen shook \n:" and would have fallen, had not Uzzah "put forth his hand to the ark \nif God, and took hold of it" (2 Samuel 6:3). In spite of Uzzah\'s good \nitentions, God instantly struck him dead for daring to touch the \nloly object. \n\nAgain, when the ark returned from Philistia, God perpetrated an \nxtraordinary slaughter of 50,070 well-intentioned people for daring \n3 look inside the ark in their joy: "And he smote the men of \nlethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even \ne smote of tlfe people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and \nle people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the \neople with a great slaughter" (1 Samuel 6:19). \n\nEven priests feared the power of the ark, and resorted to ritual \n/ashing before approaching it, "that they die not" (Exodus 30:20). \nVater was a common prophylactic charm against the destructive power \nf holy things. Philon of Byzantium said all the "ancients" used water \n)r ritual purification before entering temples; they also spun prayer- \n\'heels made of Aphrodite\'s sacred metal, copper. 1 \n\nFor some reason God lost interest in his ark by Jeremiah\'s time: \nSaith the Lord, they shall say no more, the ark of the covenant of \nle Lord: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; \neither shall it be magnified any more" (Jeremiah 3:16). \n\nThe probable cause of God\'s change of heart was a reform \nlovement to purge the temple of sexual symbols. The arks or cistae of \nle Greeks and Syrians held emblems of the lingam-yoni, such as eggs \nnd serpents, clay or dough models of genitalia. Rabbinical tradition \nlid the ark contained a hexagram representing the sexual union of God \nnd Goddess, the same meaning given to the hexagram in India. 2 \n\'hus the ark was a female container for a male god. Mary, God\'s \nDnsort in her later form, often received the title of "Ark." \n\nSemitic Arek, "ark," descended from Hindu Argha, "great ship," \nletaphorically the Great Yoni: a female-sexual vessel bearing seeds \nf life through the sea of chaos between destruction of one cosmos and \nreation of the next. 3 From the same root came "arcane," literally a \nark or crescent phase of the moon. The crescent moon boat symbol- \ned the Goddess\'s spirit dancing on her primordial uterine Ocean of \n\n\n\nvar.

H.Smith, 227. \n\n\n\nArtemis \n\nAmazonian Moon-goddess, worshipped at Ephesus under the Latin \nname of Diana or "Goddess-Anna." Like the Hindu Goddess Saranyu \nwho gave birth to all animals, she was called Mother of Creatures. \nHer image at Ephesus had a whole torso covered with breasts, to show \nthat she nurtured all living things. Yet she was also the Huntress, \nkiller of the very creatures she brought forth. 1 In Sparta her name was \ngiven as Artamis, "Cutter," or "Butcher." 2 \n\nArtemis\'s myths extend back to Neolithic sacrificial customs. At \nTaurus her holy women, under their high priestess Iphigeneia, \nsacrificed all men who landed on their shores, nailing the head of each \nvictim to a cross. 3 At Hierapolis, the Goddess\'s victims were hung on \nartificial trees in her temple. In Attica, Artemis was ritually propitiated \nwith drops of blood drawn from a man\'s neck by a sword, a symbolic \nremnant of former beheadings. Human victims were later replaced by \nbulls, hence the Goddess\'s title Tauropolos, "bull-slayer." 4 \n\nHer Huntress aspect was another form of the destroying Crone or \nwaning moon. Like Hecate, she led the nocturnal hunt; her pries- \ntesses wore the masks of hunting dogs. Alani, "hunting dogs," was the \nGreek name for Scythians who revered Artemis. The mythological \nhunting dogs who tore the Horned God Actaeon to pieces were really \nArtemis\'s sacred bitches. \n\nClassic mythographers pretended that Actaeon committed the sin \nof seeing the chaste virgin Goddess in her bath, and she condemned \n\n\n\nCft \n\n\n\nhim out of offended modesty. Actually, the bath, the nakedness, and the \ntearing to pieces of the sacred king were all part of the drama. In \nbarbarian Germany, the Goddess\'s ritual bath could be witnessed only \nby "men doomed to die." 5 Actaeon\'s deerskin and antlers marked \nhim as the pre-Hellenic stag king, reigning over the sacred hunt for half \na Great Year before he was torn to pieces and replaced by his tanist \n(co-king). In the first century a.d., Artemis\'s priestesses still pursued and \nkilled a man dressed as a stag on the Goddess\'s mountain. 6 Her \ngroves became the "deer-gardens" (German Tiergarten, Swedish Djur- \ngarden), once the scene of venison feasts. \n\nOne of Artemis\'s most popular animal incarnations was the Great \nShe-Bear, Ursa Major, ruler of the stars and protectress of the axis \nmundi, Pole of the World, marked in heaven by the Pole Star at the \ncenter of the small circle described by the constellation Ursa Major. \nHelvetian tribes in the neighborhood of Berne worshipped her as the \nShe-Bear, which is still the heraldic symbol of Berne. The city\'s very \nname means "She-Bear." 7 Sometimes the Helvetians called her Artio, \nshortened to Art by Celtic peoples who coupled her with the bear- \nking Arthur. As Artio\'s Lord of the Hunt, the medieval god of witches \ncame to be known as "Robin son of Art." According to the Irish, Art \nmeant "God," but its earlier connotation was "Goddess" specifically \nthe Bear-Goddess. 8 She was also canonized as a Christian saint, \nUrsula, derived from her Saxon name of Ursel, the She-Bear. \n\nThere was a rather sophisticated astronomical reason for worship- \nping the heavenly She-Bear who followed her track around the Pole \nStar, year by year. It was probably discovered first in the far east. "The \nmonths and seasons are determined by the revolution of Ursa Major. \nThe tail of the constellation pointing to the east at nightfall announces \nthe arrival of spring, pointing to the south the arrival of summer, \npointing to the west the arrival of autumn, and pointing to the north the \narrival of winter. . . . The Great Bear occupies a prominent position \nin the Taoist heavens as the aerial throne of the supreme deity." This \ndeity in Taoist tradition is the Queen of Heaven, Holy Mother Ma \nTsu P\'o, with characteristics similar to those of Artemis. She protects \nseafarers and governs the weather; she is called a virgin, and Matron \nof the Measure; she is a Mother of Mercy who has been compared to \nthe virgin Mary and to the Buddhist Goddess Maritchi. 9 \n\nThe axis mundi was often associated with male gods, as either a \nGreat Serpent or a World Tree more or less recognized as a phallic \nsymbol. Similarly the Little Bear within the circle of the Great Bear was \npictured by the Greeks as Areas, her son (see Callisto). Yet among \nthe oldest traditions may be found hints that this world-supporting tree \nor pole was female. Even as Yggdrasil, the World Tree of the \nVikings, it showed many parallels with birth-giving, fruit- or milk- \nproducing mother trees of the Near East, under its older name of \nMjotvidr or Mutvidr, "Mother-Tree." Sometimes it was Mead-Tree, \nlike "the milk-giving tree of the Finno-Ugric peoples, a symbol which \nmust go back ultimately to Mesopotamia, and be of great antiquity." It \n\n\n\nArtemis \n\n\n\nUrsa Major "Great \nBear," colloquially \ncalled the Big \nDipper, a circumpolar \nconstellation with \nseven bright stars \nincluding the "north \npole pointers." For a \nbrief time the \nconstellation was \nrenamed Charles\'s \nWain, after the chariot \nof Charlemagne. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n\n\nArtha \nArthur \n\n\n\nTatian 2nd-century \nChristian apologist of \nGreek education and \nGnostic leanings.

Its fruit could be given to women \nin childbirth "that what is within may pass out." The spring at the tree\'s \nroot was a fountain of wisdom or of the life-giving fluid aurr, which \nmay be likened to the "wise blood" of the Mother that much- \nmythologized feminine life-source likened to the Kula nectar in the \nuterine spring of Kundalini, as if the maternal tree upholding the \nuniverse were the Mother\'s spine with its many chakras. 10 See \nMenstrual Blood. \n\n"Many-breasted" Artemis was always a patroness of nurture, \nfertility, and birth. Male gods turned against these attributes in \nopposing the cult of the Goddess. Her own twin brother and sometime \nconsort Apollo made birth illegal on his sacred isle of Delos; \npregnant women had to be removed from the island lest they offend the \ngod by giving birth there. 11 Christians continued to vilify Artemis. \nTatian said, "Artemis is a poisoner; Apollo performs cures." 12 The \nGospels demanded destruction of Artemis\'s Ephesian temple (Acts \n19:27). St. John Chrysostom preached against this temple in 406 a.d. \nSoon afterward, it was looted and burned.

See Earth. \n\n\n\nArthur \n\nKing Arthur was the Welsh Arth Vawr, Heavenly Bear. His prede- \ncessor or "father" was Uther Pendragon, "Wonderful Head of the \nDragon." 1 Where did the dragon\'s head precede the bear? At the \nhub of the heavens, which the ancients always anxiously watched. \n\nIn the 3rd millenium b.c, the north pole star was not the present \nPolaris in Ursa Minor, the Little Bear. It was Alpha Draconis, the \nHead of the Dragon. 2 Due to precession of the equinoxes, a slow subtle \nshift of the celestial pole took place over the course of 5000 years. \nHowever difficult it may have been to observe, the ancients seem to \n\n\n\n60 \n\n\n\nhave known about it. India as well as Britain placed the former north \npole in the constellation of the Dragon. The Mahabharata said the pole \nstar, to which "the yoke of the world" was fixed, was the head of the \nGreat Serpent. 3 \n\nGreeks said the little bear-god who replaced the serpent was Areas, \nancestor of the Arcadians. His mother was Artemis Calliste, the \nGreat She-Bear who used to rule all the stars. 4 As Ursa Major, she still \ncircles the pole. Western Europeans called her Artio, Art, Ursel, or \nErcel. 5 Arthur was a Celtic version of her son, spouse, sacred king. \n\nArthur was another humanization of an old pagan god apparent- \nly very old, for he had no credible human parentage but rather many \ncontradictory miraculous-birth myths. Some said he had no father. Like \nthe Norse god Heimdall and the Saxon hero Scyld, he was born of \nthe Ninefold Sea-goddess and cast ashore on the ninth wave, to land at \nMerlin\'s feet. 6 Bulfinch\'s Mythology said Arthur\'s father was Ambro- \nsius, an earlier name for Merlin. \n\nThe story of Uther Pendragon\'s fatherhood of Arthur bears marks \nof strained revision. Arthur\'s royal mother was married to Uther\'s \nrival at the time. Uther was far away, but with Merlin\'s help he sent his \nspirit to her in the guise of her husband, while the latter was being \nkilled. Arthur was begotten at the instant his official father died. He was \ntaken away by Merlin to be raised in a secret place until he came of \nage the cliche secret upbringing of every sacred king\'s career. \n\nArthur\'s mother was really the Triple Goddess, incarnate in the \nqueen as usual. Her three daughters represented herself in triad: \nElaine, the virgin Lily Maid; Margawse, mother of the four Aeons; \nMorgan, Queen of the Shades. Arthur later coupled with his sister \nMargawse and incestuously begot his own son-nephew-supplanter, \nMordred, who was likewise taken away at birth to be raised in hiding. \n\nAs Galahad was the reincarnated Lancelot, so Mordred was the \nreincarnated Arthur, destined to succeed him by both matrilineal and \npatrilineal right, as both sister\'s-son and son. Like all kings threatened by \nthe Oedipal rival, Arthur tried to kill Mordred by a Slaughter of the \nInnocents. He collected all the children born on May Day, the birthday \nof his prophesied supplanter, put them on a ship, and sent them out \nto sea to be wrecked. Of course Mordred survived the wreck and grew \nup to return incognito to Arthur\'s court. 8 \n\nArthur lost his sacred mana when he lost his queen, the Triple \nGoddess incarnate in Guinevere, who was really three Guineveres \naccording to the Welsh Triads. 9 Mordred seized her, thus symbolically \nseizing the kingdom, and brought Arthur to his death. \n\nWhen Arthur died, the same Triple Goddess took him back into \nthe sea that gave him birth. "Three fairy queens" carried him away to \nthe western isles of paradise, singing his death-song, the kind of song \nWelsh bards called marwysgafen giving-back-to-the-sea-mother. 10 \nThe three fairy queens were really the final triad of the Ninefold \nGoddess, Morgan le Fay and two of her alter egos: the Queen of \n\n\n\nArthur \n\n\n\nMahabharata \n\nIndian epic poem, \nconsisting of historical \nand legendary \nmaterial gathered \nbetween the 4th and \n10th centuries a.d., \nincluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\nWelsh Triads \n\nPoetic literature of pre- \nChristian Wales, drawn \nfrom the bards\' oral \ntradition. \n\nNinefold Goddess \n\nThe triple trinity, as \nexemplified by the \nNine Muses of Greece, \nthe Nine Sisters of \nScandinavia, the Nine \nMorgans of the \nFortunate Isles, etc. \n\n\n\n61 \n\n\n\nAryan \nAsceticism \n\n\n\nBrythonicOfthe \n\nBritish branch of Celts, \nincluding speakers of \nthe Welsh, Cornish, \nand Breton \nlanguages. \n\n\n\nNorthgallis (i.e., North Gaul, or Brittany), and the Queen of the \nWesterlands, which meant the isles of the dead. 11 These isles were \nsaid to be ruled by nine fairy sisters, the leader of whom was Morgan. \n\nArthur\'s legends generally suggest no human king, but a Brythonic \ngod, whom Johnson called a Celtic Zeus. 12 He may have been \nincarnate in one or several warrior kings for brief periods, but his basic \nstory was mythic rather than historical. \n\n1.

In Persia he \nbecame known as Ahriman, the dark earth god, opponent or \nsubterranean alter ego of the solar deity Ormazd (Ahura Mazda). In \nCeltic Ireland he was Eremon, one of the sacred kings who married \nthe Earth (Tara). \n\nThough there was nothing "pure" about either the name or the \nfar-flung mixture of tribes it was supposed to describe, the term \n"pure Aryan" was revived in Nazi Germany to support a mythological \nconcept of Teutonic stock, the so-called Master Race. Non-Aryans \nwere all the "inferior" strains: Semites, Negroes, gypsies, Slavs, and \nLatinate or "swarthy" people whose blood was said to be polluting \nthe Nordic superiority of their betters. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 33. \n\n\n\nAsceticism \n\nThe religion of self-denial, such as practiced by early Christian \neremites, characterized by self-inflicted pain, hunger, and other auster- \nities, and renunciation of sensual pleasures. \n\nPerhaps the earliest sectaries to regard asceticism as the key \nto heaven were Jain Buddhists (see Jains), whose theology influenced \nPersian patriarchs, who in turn influenced Jewish eremites like the \nEssenes. Jain Buddhist monks had already penetrated the courts of \nSyria, Egypt, Macedonia, and Epirus by the 4th century B.C., and \nwere glorified in legend for the alleged magic powers they developed \nthrough prodigies of self-denial. 1 \n\nOriginally, men\'s ascetic practices seem to have evolved from a \nnotion that extreme forms of self-denial would bring them the \nmagical female capacity to give birth. Oriental myths said the first \n\n\n\n62 \n\n\n\ncreator-gods acquired the ability to produce living things by "practic- \ning fierce asceticism for ten thousand years." 2 \n\nThough men never achieved the ability to give birth, they claimed \nother miraculous powers developed by asceticism. Perfected eremites \nwere said to fly, to walk on water, to understand all languages, to turn \nbase metals into gold, to heal lameness and blindness, and other \nmiracles that became the common property of all scriptures including \nthe Christian ones. 5 \n\nJain Buddhists looked upon women as hopelessly inferior in the \npursuit of asceticism. Their handbook said no woman could achieve \nNirvana, because "in the womb, between the breasts, in their navel and \nloins, a subtle emanation of life is continually taking place. How then \ncan they be fit for self-control? A woman may be pure in faith and even \noccupied with a study of the sutras or the practice of a terrific \nasceticism; in her case there will be no falling away of karmic matter." 4 \n\nSome of the ascetics openly despised sexuality and motherhood. \nThe Mahabharata anticipated St. Augustine\'s remarks about the \nnastiness of birth: "-Man emerges mixed with excrement and water, \nfouled with the impurities of woman. A wise man will avoid the \ncontaminating society of women as he would the touch of bodies \ninfested with vermin." 5 Some advertised their renunciation of sex by \ncastrating themselves or affixing large metal rings in the flesh of the \npenis. 6 \n\nEssenic Judaism and early Christianity were offshoots of the Jain \ntradition, urging abandonment of the family and of all secular \nconcerns. 7 Like the art of the Jains, Christian art in the early medieval \nperiod showed stiff, crude, doll-like figures, apparently bodiless under \ntheir wooden draperies, even hands and faces badly drawn. Not even \nartists were permitted to study the human form. 8 To look at some- \nthing attractive especially if it was made of flesh was highly suspect \nbecause the observer might enjoy the act of looking. According to St. \nJerome, a Christian must consider poisonous every act or experience \nhaving the smallest hint of sensual pleasure. 9 \n\nPain, however, was permitted and encouraged throughout the \nChristian era. St. Catherine of Siena was highly praised for whipping \nherself three times a day, once for her own sins, once for the sins of the \nliving, and once for the sins of the dead. St. Simeon Stylites was \nglorified for remaining motionless on top of his pillar, like Buddhist \nstanding-yogis, until his living flesh rotted. 10 \n\nFathers of the church constantly urged asceticism upon the faith- \nful. Gregory of Nyssa touted it in terms of both wetness and dryness: \n"As the tympanum, from which all moisture has been removed so that it \nis exceedingly dry, gives out a loud noise, so also is virginity, which \nreceives no life-giving moisture, illustrious and renowned." " Again he \nsaid: "We often see water, contained in a pipe, bursting upward \nthrough this constraining force, which will not let it leak, and this in \nspite of its natural gravitation; in the same way the mind of man, \n\n\n\nAsceticism \n\n\n\nMahabharata \n\nIndian epic poem, \nconsisting of \nhistorical and legendary \nmaterial gathered \nbetween the 4th and \n10th centuries a.d., \nincluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n\n\nAsceticism enclosed in the compact channel of an habitual continence, and not \n\nhaving any side issues, will be raised by virtue of its natural powers of \n^ B| ^ B ^^^^ B i^^ motion to an exalted love." n \n\nMoral tales told by the Christian fathers concentrated on renuncia- \ntion of sexual love, and acceptance of painful martyrdom. The tale of \nSts. Cyprian and Justina is typical. Cyprian, a pagan sorcerer, fell in love \nwith the Christian maiden Justina and cast a love spell on her. \nThough sworn to virginity like all good Christian maidens, Justina was \ntortured by desire. Nevertheless she conquered her desire and proved \nher piety with such prodigies of asceticism that she impressed even \nCyprian: she fasted almost to death, she slept naked on the stony \nground, she mutilated herself to spoil her beauty. 13 Cyprian was so \nintrigued by all this he turned Christian too, and was martyred along \nwith his incorrigible virgin. 14 \n\nHuman love was anathema to the early Christians who insisted \nthat families must be abandoned. Sexual impulses were perverted \ninto unnatural obsessions. 15 The fall of Rome was not entirely unrelated \nto Christians\' abhorrence of the basic social unit of the state: the \ninterlocked loyalties and dependencies of the family. Jesus himself \nundermined the family in his teaching: "If any man come to me, and \nhate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and breth- \nren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple" \n(Luke 14:26). Becker says Christianity stood for "renunciation of this \nworld and the satisfactions of this life, which is why the pagans thought \nChristianity was crazy. It was a sort of anti-heroism by an animal who \ndenied life in order to deny evil." 16 \n\nPrinciples of asceticism so embedded themselves in Christian \nsociety that nearly every kind of sensual pleasure came to be regarded \nas wicked only because it was pleasant. The delights of sacramental \ndancing were forbidden. A story from Ramersdorf in the Rhine- \nland tells of a Christian missionary priest who found youths and maidens \ndancing together on the Sabbath. He called God\'s curse on them, \nwhich forced them to go on dancing day and night until they lost their \nminds. 17 Some European peasants still abstain from sexual inter- \ncourse during the sowing season, in the church-fostered belief that \nsexual activity might call down a curse on the crop. 18 \n\nIn the 18th century, theologians were still preaching the wicked- \nness of even the most subtle feelings of pleasure. Beaumont \ncounseled women especially to attribute any enjoyable bodily sensation \nto the devil\'s influence: "If ye perceive a sudden sweet taste in your \nmouths or feel any warmth in your breasts, like fire, or any form of \npleasure in any part of your body, or ... if ye become aware by \noccasion of pleasure or satisfaction derived from such perception, that \nyour hearts are drawn away from the contemplation of Jesus Christ \nand from spiritual exercises . . . then this sensation is very much to be \nsuspected of coming from the Enemy; and therefore were it ever so \nwonderful and striking, still renounce it." 19 Yet the obsessive contem- \n\n\n\n64 \n\n\n\nplation of pain, starting with Jesus\'s pain on the cross, was always to Asceticism \n\nbe encouraged. \n\nThe most significant difference between Christianity and its pagan ^^^^^^^^^_ \nforerunners was this reversal of the pleasure-pain continuum. Earlier \nsocieties regarded sensual pleasure as a touch of divinity, and "bliss" \nsexual or otherwise as a foretaste of heaven. Woman was a carrier \nof the divine spark because of her capacity to give and receive physical \npleasure. The Christian theory turned this opinion completely \naround. Fathers of the church taught that the human race must die out \nthrough universal celibacy, before Jesus could return and establish his \nheaven on earth. Reasoning that man fell from grace through woman, \nman could return to grace only by renouncing woman. 20 Therefore, \nmedieval churchmen came to identify sexuality with the worst of \nheresies and sins, especially since St. Augustine had labeled it the \npipeline of original sin. Even Protestant theologians adopted this view. \nCalvin said that, because of its origin in sexuality and in a woman\'s \nbody, every child was "defiled and polluted" in God\'s sight even before \nit saw the light of the day; a newborn infant is a "seed-bed of sin and \ntherefore cannot but be odious and abominable to God." Martin Luther \nmarried an ex-nun, but still didn\'t think much of sex. He said, "Had \nGod consulted me in the matter, I would have advised him to continue \nthe generation of the species by fashioning them out of clay." 21 \n\nThis note of arrogance, even hubris, in the idea of man issuing \ninstructions to God, was always a hidden component of asceticism, \ndespite its outward show of extreme or unnatural humility. "Nothing is \nprouder than the humility of the ascetic of other-worldly spirit that \nproclaims itself superior to the whole natural world, or than the \nmysticism that renounces the self only to commune with God \nhimself." 22 Here lies the real reason for men\'s secret delight in ascetic \nprinciples and practices. It must be remembered that the original \npurpose of such self-denial was to become identified with a god and to \nacquire God\'s sacred powers for one\'s self. \n\nBecoming a god meant acquiring the ability to perform miracles, as \nmany Christian ascetics were supposed to have done. By definition, \nmiracles flouted the laws of nature. Thus the ascetic became deliberate- \nly un-natural, confusing the denial of his own instinctual desires with \ndenial of Mother Nature\'s observed habits. Ascetic ideals therefore \nplaced body and spirit in conflict with each other. "Asceticism is the \nethical code which arises inevitably from a dualistic opposition between \nthe spiritual and the natural. These are represented as absolutely irre- \nconcilable and mutually antagonistic; if a man is to escape the natural he \nmust renounce the rights of his physical nature in the interests of his \nspiritual." 25 The psychic problem of such dualistic opinion is still much \nin evidence. \n\n1.

Angus, 219. \n\n\n\nAsherah \n\nSemitic name of the Great Goddess, possibly from Old Iranian asha, \n"Universal Law," a law of the matriarch, like Roman ius naturale. 1 \nAsherah was "in wisdom the Mistress of the Gods." 2 Sumerians \ncalled her Ashnan, "strength of all things," and "a kindly and bountiful \nmaiden." 3 Her sacred city Mar-ash appears in the Bible as Mareshah \n(Joshua 15:44). \n\nThe Old Testament "Asherah" is translated "grove," without any \nexplanation that the sacred grove represented the Goddess\'s genital \ncenter, birthplace of all things. In the matriarchal period, Hebrews \nworshipped the Goddess in groves (1 Kings 14:23), later cut down by \npatriarchal reformers who burned the bones of Asherah\'s priests on their \nown altars (2 Chronicles 24:4-5). \n\nThe Goddess\'s grove-yoni was Athra qaddisa, "the holy place" \n(literally, "divine harlot"). Sometimes she was called simply "Holi- \nness," a word later applied to Yahweh. Canaanites called her Qaniyatu \nelima, She Who Gives Birth to the Gods, or Rabbatu athiratu \nyammi, Lady Who Traverses the Sea (i.e., the Moon). 4 Rabbatu was an \nearly female form of rabbi. Athirat, Athra, Aethra, Athyr, and Egypt\'s \nHathor were all variations of the same name for the Goddess. 5 In Egypt \nshe was also a Law-giving Mother, Ashesh, an archaic form of Isis; \nthe name meant both "pouring out" and "supporting," the functions of \nher breasts. Her yonic shrine in Thebes was Asher, Ashrel, or Ashrelt. \nSome called her "Great Lady of Ashert, the lady of heaven, the queen \nof the gods." 6 \n\nFor a while, Asherah accepted the Semitic god El as her consort. \nShe was the Heavenly Cow, he the Bull. 7 After their sacred marriage, \nshe bore the Heavenly Twins, Shaher and Shalem, the stars of morning \nand evening (see Lucifer). The marriage rite seems to have involved \nthe cooking of a kid in its mother\'s milk, a procedure later forbidden by \nJewish priests (Exodus 23:19). 8 \n\n1. Larousse, 312; Bachofen, 192. 2.

Ashes were called the seed of \nthe fire god Agni, with power to absolve all sins. Even if a man does \n"a thousand things that one ought not to do, by bathing in ashes he will \ncause all of that to be burnt to ashes as fire burns a forest with its ener- \ngy." Another source said ashes stood for the purifying blood of Shiva, in \n\n\n\n66 \n\n\n\nwhich one could bathe away sins, as Christians bathed in the blood of \nthe Lamb. 1 \n\nAt Rome\'s New Year Feast of Atonement in March, people wore \nsackcloth and bathed in ashes to atone for their sins. 2 Then as now, \nNew Year\'s Eve was a carnival of eating, drinking, and sinning, on the \ntheory that all sins would be wiped out the following day. As the \ndying god of March, Mars took his worshippers\' sins with him into \ndeath. Therefore the carnival fell on dies martis, the Day of Mars. In \nEnglish this was Tuesday, because Mars was identified with the Saxon \ngod Tiw. In French the carnival day was Mardi Gras, "Fat Tues- \nday," the day of merrymaking before Ash Wednesday. \n\nA Catholic directory of 1 5 1 1 ordered priests to say to the congre- \ngation on Ash Wednesday, "Remember, man, you are ashes and to \nashes will return." Fuller\'s Church History said the purpose of Ash \nWednesday was to remind every man that he is "but ashes and earth, \nand thereto shall return." 5 These maxims oddly contradicted the \nchurch\'s official doctrine of the resurrection of the flesh. Their purpose \nwas to justify with* some Christian gloss the ancient notion that \nredemption might be brought about by contact with ashes. \n\n1. O\'Flaherty, 148-49, 174. 2. Encyc.

Tobit\'s Asmodeus was really "the god \nAsmo," or Aeshma, a Persian deity associated with Ahriman. Zoroastri- \nan priests may have brought about his original diabolization because \nof an archaic connection with the Goddess Ma. 1 \n\n1 . Larousse, 3 1 8. \n\n\n\nBook of Tobit One \n\nof the Apocrypha, once \naccepted as part of \nthe Judeo-Christian \ncanon of sacred \nscriptures but later elim- \ninated from the \nofficial canon. \n\n\n\nAss \n\nThe ass-god Pales had an extensive cult throughout the ancient \nworld. Palestine, Philistia, and the Palatine Hill in Rome were named \nfor Pales, who was both male and female. 1 \n\nThe Old Norse word Ass meant both "Asian" and "deity," \npossibly indicating that the divine ass originated in Asia. 2 The pre- \nVedic sacred king Ravana sported ten crowned human heads \nsurmounted by one ass head, symbolizing the spirit of the ass god \nincarnate in ten kings. 3 The long ears of the ass seem to have had the \nsame significance of virility in ancient India as the horns of the sacred \nbull or stag. 4 \n\nTacitus said the Jews worshipped the ass because wild asses were \nresponsible for their survival in the desert. 5 According to Genesis 36:24, \n\n\n\nCornelius Tacitus \n\nRoman historian \nand rhetorician, ca. \n56-120 a.d. \n\n\n\n67 \n\n\n\nAss \n\n\n\nPyramid Texts Col- \nlections of prayers, \nhymns, and magic \nspells inscribed on the \ninner walls of the \npyramids at Saqqarah \n(Sakkara), dating \nfrom the 5 th through \n7th dynasties. \n\n\n\nit was the tribal matriarch Anah, or Hannah, who first found asses in the \nwilderness. Balaam\'s oracular she-ass may have been a manifestation of \nthe spirit of Anah, as Balaam himself was another name for Baal. \nSamson slew the Philistines with an ass\'s jawbone, the same bone still \nregarded as a seat of the soul by some African tribes. 6 Jesus entered \nJerusalem on an ass\'s colt, symbol of the New Year. The lilim or \nChildren of Lilith were ass-haunched, for they were spirits left over \nfrom the real source of the Jewish ass-cult: Egypt, home of the ass- \nheaded god Set, or Seth. \n\nSet once ruled the dynastic gods, and in token of his sovereignty \ndisplayed a pair of ass\'s ears at the tip of a reed scepter. The Hyksos \nkings of Egypt revived Set\'s cult in the 2nd millenium B.C., perhaps \nbecause their own ass-eared Midas was a similar god-king. The annual \nalternation of Set and his brother Osiris (or Horus), who murdered each \nother in perpetual rivalry for the favors of Isis, reflected constant \nreplacement of sacred kings in pre-dynastic times. 7 \n\nAss-eared king Midas, a son of Cybele, died of drinking bull\'s \nblood. In other words, he was connected with the Taurobolium or bull- \nsacrifice made in honor of both Cybele and Isis. Midas has been \nidentified with Mita ("Seed"), a king of the Moschians or "calf-men," \nwho invaded the country of the Hittites from Thrace during the second \nmillenium B.C. Midas\'s Golden Touch and ass\'s ears link him with the \ncult of Set and the Golden Calf (Horus), whose image was worshipped \nby the Israelites (Exodus 32:2-4). \n\nUnder Egypt\'s Hyksos kings, Set was a god of the hot desert wind, \nknown as the Breath of the Ass. He was "Lord of the Chambers of the \nSouth," whence storm winds came. 8 His wind from the desert was \nsupposed to bring pestilence, i.e., typhus, derived from Set\'s Greek \nname, Typhon. This name was interlingual and world-wide. It meant \nboth the ass god and the wind called tufan in Arabic and Hindustani; t\'ai \nfung in Chinese; and tuffbon or Typhoon in the South Pacific. 9 \n\nAss-headed Set was a sacrificial deity in the cult of Horus and \nOsiris. He was crucified on a furka and wounded in the side. 10 He and \nHorus were represented as alternating year-gods who fought and \ncastrated one another, each being baptized in the blood of the other\'s \n"phallic eye," as the Pyramid Text said: "Horus is purified with the \nEye of his brother Set; Set is purified with the Eye of his brother \nHorus." n The Eye or phallus passed from one to the other. A statue \nof Horus at Coptos carried Set\'s severed phallus in his hand. 12 After \ncastrating Set, Horus spread his blood on the fields to render them \nfertile the usual fructification-by-male-blood found in the oldest sacri- \nficial Mysteries. 13 \n\nThus, Set and Horus were remnants of a primitive sacred-king \ncult, which the Jews adopted. The story of the rival gods appeared in \nthe Bible as Seth\'s supplanting of the sacrificed shepherd Abel, evidently \n\n\n\n68 \n\n\n\nthe same "Good Shepherd" as Osiris-Horus (Genesis 4:25). Their \nrivalry was resolved in Egypt by having the pharaoh unite both gods in \nhimself. Tomb paintings of Rameses IV showed him as both Set and \nHorus, two heads set upon one neck. 14 \n\nSimilarly, the Jewish God uniting both Father and Son was \nsometimes an ass-headed man crucified on a tree. This was one of the \nearliest representations of the Messiah\'s crucifixion. Some said Christ \nwas the same as the Jewish ass-god Iao, identified with Set. 15 Jews in \nRome were said to worship an ass\'s head as their deity. 16 \n\nThe Roman cult of the ass apparently originated in Libya, home of \nthe bisexual Pales, whose temple stood on the Palatine Hill and gave \nrise to the word "palace." 17 Servius said Pales was a Goddess, the Diva \nPalatua, a disguise of Vesta. Others said Pales was either a female \nprotectress of herd animals, or Vesta\'s male consort. In the first two \ncenturies a.d., Pales was worshipped as a priapic god at the festival of \nthe Palilia, traditional date of the founding of Rome, when the Palladi- \num was brought to Vesta\'s temple. 18 Priests of Pales wore ass-head \nmasks as they danced in honor of the long-eared deity. The Palilia was \ntaken into the Christian calendar as the Feast of St. George. One of \nits old customs may have given rise to the Halloween game of "Pin the \nTail on the Donkey," which recalls Rome\'s sacrifices of equine tails \ntriumphantly carried to the temple of Vesta. 19 \n\nI.

See Aladdin. \n\n\n\nAstarte \n\nLady of Byblos, one of the oldest forms of the Great Goddess in the \nMiddle East, identified with Egypt\'s Hathor, Mycenae\'s Demeter, \nCyprus\'s Aphrodite. \n\nHer shrine at Byblos dated back to the Neolithic and flourished \nthroughout the Bronze Age. 1 She was the same creating-preserving- \nand-destroying Goddess worshipped by all Indo-European cultures, and \nstill typified by Kali as the symbol of Nature. Astarte was the "true \nsovereign of the world," tirelessly creating and destroying, eliminating \n\n\n\nThe Bible calls her \nAsherah or Ashtoreth, \nthe Goddess wor- \nshipped by Solomon \n(1 Kings 11:5). \n\n\n\n69 \n\n\n\nAster \nAstraea \n\n\n\nTo the Arabs the \nGoddess was Athtar, \n"Venus in the \nMorning." In Aramaic \nshe was Attar-Sa- \nmayin, "Morning Star \nof Heaven," uniting \ntwo sexes in herself, like \nLucifer the Morning \nStar and Diana Luci- \nfera. Her Hurrian \nname was Attart, or \nsometimes Ishara, \nanother form of Ishtar, \n"the Star." 4 To Ca- \nnaanites, she was \nCelestial Ruler, Mis- \ntress of Kingship, \nmother of all baaJim \n(gods). 5 \n\n\n\nthe old and generating the new. 2 Sidonian kings could not rule \nwithout her permission. Each king styled himself first and foremost \n"Priest of Astarte." \n\nSumerian cylinder seals from Lagash, ca. 2300 B.C., showed the \nGoddess in a pose identical with Kali\'s love-and-death sacramental \nposture, squatting on top of her consort\'s body. 5 \n\nAstarte ruled all the spirits of the dead who lived in heaven wearing \nbodies of light, visible from earth as stars. Hence, she was known as \nAstroarche, "Queen of the Stars." 6 She was the mother of all souls in \nheaven, the Moon surrounded by her star-children, to whom she \ngave their "astral" (starry) bodies. Occultists still speak of the astral body \nas an invisible double, having forgotten the word\'s original connota- \ntion of starlight. 7 \n\nAstarte-Ashtoreth was transformed into a devil by Christian writ- \ners, who automatically assumed that any deity mentioned in the Bible \nother than Yahweh was one of the denizens of hell. She was also \nmasculinized. One finds in books of the 1 5th and 16th centuries a \ndemon Ashtoreth or Astaroth, a "duke" or "prince" of hell. 8 Milton \nknew better; he spoke of "Astarte, queen of heaven, with crescent \nhorns." 9 \n\nScholars who really understood the mystery of Astarte recognized \nin her one of the ancient prototypes of the virgin Mary. In Syria and \nEgypt her sacred dramas celebrated the rebirth of the solar god from the \ncelestial Virgin each 25th of December. A newborn child was \nexhibited, while the cry went up that the Virgin had brought forth. \nFrazer says, "No doubt the Virgin who thus conceived and bore a \nson on the twenty-fifth of December was the great Oriental goddess \nwhom the Semites called the Heavenly Virgin or simply the Heavenly \nGoddess; in Semitic lands she was a form of Astarte." 10 \n\n1.

Like Minerva, Athene, Maat, and other \nmanifestations of the same Goddess, she was characterized as a celestial \nVirgin dispensing the fates of men. See Virgo. \n\n\n\nAstrology \n\n\n\nAstrology \n\nStudy of the stars has been called "the basis of all intellectual \nculture." \' It was highly refined by the Chaldeans, who were simulta- \nneously astronomers and astrologers. Unlike modern "Chaldeans," \nthey were moon worshippers, basing their system almost entirely on the \nmovements of the Moon-goddess. Their zodiac was known as \nHouses of the Moon. 2 \n\nApparently a majority of moon-watchers were women, the pries- \ntesses charged with determining correct seasons for planting and \nharvest, drawing up calendars, etc. Pliny said the study of the heavens, \nto foretell events such as eclipses, was traditionally the business of \nwomen. He suspected the priestesses\' magic didn\'t cause eclipses, but \nrather foresaw them by scientific measurements; yet "the most part \nof the common people have been and are of this opinion . . . that all the \nsame is done by enchantments, and that by the means of some \nsorceries and herbs together, both sun and moon may be charmed, and \nenforced both to loose and recover their light: to do which feat, \nwomen are thought to be more skilful and meet than men." He credited \nthe Goddesses Medea and Circe with special powers over the lights \nof heaven. 3 \n\nDivination by the lights of heaven was another particular province \nof the Moon-goddess and her sybils, the word cognate with the \nGoddess Cybele and possibly derived from Chaldean subultu, the \nCelestial Virgin (the constellation of Virgo). 4 An archaic term for \nastrological divination was mathesis, "the Learning," literally Mother- \nwisdom. Chaldean astrologers were Mathematici, "learned \nmothers." 5 \n\nAs a result of its ancient feminine associations, astrology was \nviewed as a devilish art by many fathers of the Christian church. \nSome thought it indistinguishable from witchcraft. Others respected it. \nOrigen said the stars are intelligent spirits, able to foresee the future \nand communicate their knowledge by their observed motions. St. \nThomas Aquinas agreed with this. He said man\'s fate is the power \nexerted by the stars in their movements. 6 \n\nSavonarola thought it a disgrace, however, that in his day the \nchurch was "wholly governed by astrology," as he said. Every \nimportant prelate had his "Chaldean" at his side, determining every \nmove by the stars. 7 St. Jerome said astrology was idolatry. Sts. Gregory, \nAmbrose, Chrysostom, Eusebius, and Lactantius all condemned it. \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, ex- \nerting a powerful \ninfluence on the early \nGreek church. At \nfirst he was accounted a \nsaint, but three cen- \nturies after his death he \nwas declared a here- \ntic because of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\n\n\n71 \n\n\n\nAtalanta \n\n\n\nCouncil of Toledo \n\nThe greatest theological \nsignificance was at- \ntributed to the church \ncouncil held in Tole- \ndo in 675 a.d., though \nthere were seventeen \nother church councils in \nthe same city be- \ntween the 5 th and 8th \ncenturies. \n\nZodiacus Christianas \nA curious astrological \nwork claiming Jesuit \norigin. Full title: \nZodiacus Christianus \nlocupletatus seu \nSigna XII Divinae \nPraedestinationis. \nTotidem Symbolis ex- \nplicata ab Hierem \nDrexilio e Societatis \nJesu. \n\nPeter of Abano \n\n(1250-1318) Renais- \nsance scholar, \nphysician, geomancer, \nastrologer, and here- \ntic; an acquaintance of \nMarco Polo. \n\n\n\nSt. Augustine said astrology must be expelled from all Christian nations. \nIt was prohibited by the Council of Toledo. 8 \n\nDespite all this, the church took astrology to its bosom in the 12th \nand 1 3th centuries. Pope Julius II settled the date of his coronation on \nthe advice of astrologers. Pope Paul III planned the consistory by \nhoroscopes. Pope Leo X founded a chair of astrology in a major \nuniversity. 9 Signs of the zodiac were associated with the apostles. \nCathedrals were decorated with astrological symbols. The Zodiacus \nChristianus compared the zodiac to the stages of Christian life and the \ntwelve virtues. 10 \n\nPeter of Abano was one of the few unbelievers. He openly scoffed \nat God, and managed to avoid the Inquisition only by dying at an \nopportune moment. Toward the end, he remarked that he had devoted \nhis life to three noble arts: philosophy, which made him subtle; \nmedicine, which made him rich; and astrology, which made him a liar. 11 \n\nProtestants were not as enthusiastic about astrology as Catholics. \nQueen Elizabeth I of England disapproved of the Chaldean art, fearing \nimplications of treason against the royal person in prognosticating the \nlength of her life. Toward the latter part of her reign, she imposed \nsevere legal penalties for casting royal horoscopes. 12 Protestant leaflets \nlisted among the "sins of the papists" such as "Observation and choice \nof days, of planetary hours, of motions and courses of stars \n. . . horoscoping, or marking the hours of nativities, witchcrafts, en- \nchantments, and all such superstitious trumpery." 13 \n\nYet the common people retained many superstitious beliefs based \non astrology. The idea that the stars are souls in heaven never really \ndied out. English peasants were sure that a falling star denoted either a \nconception or a birth some said one, some said the other, for none \nwere clear about which moment the soul descended from heaven to \noccupy its new body. 14 Because it represented an essence of new life, \nthe falling star was and still is "wished on," like any spirit thought to be \npassing from one world to another. \n\n1.

Christian \ntheologians tended to regard atheism as devilish, though atheism im- \nplied disbelief in devils as well as all other supernatural entities. \n\nOriental thinkers were less simplistic about atheism. The more \nadvanced sages taught that non-belief can be more "religious" than \nbelief indeed, atheism may make better human beings than faith can \nmake. In the east "it is not thought impossible that atheism may be as \nprofoundly religious as theism, nor is atheism regarded by religious men \nas in itself unspiritual. This is extremely hard for a westerner to \nunderstand he does not see that the essence of religion lies in the \nreligious experience, and not in any belief at all, and that all so-called \nreligious beliefs or doctrines are merely theories about the religious \nexperience." \' \n\nEvans- Wentz called attention to the same Oriental thought: \n" The Fatherhood of God\' as a personal and anthropomorphic deity is \nthe cornerstone of Christian theology, but in Buddhism although \nthe Buddha neither denied nor affirmed the existence of a Supreme \nDeity it has no place, because, as the Buddha maintained, neither \nbelieving nor not believing in a Supreme God, but self-exertion in right- \ndoing, is essential to comprehending the true nature of life." 2 \n\nBy these standards, no criminal could be considered religious, no \nmatter how much faith he professed.

Oriental sages viewed theological \n\nmmmm ^ m j, mam ^^ reasoning with a certain contempt, as irrelevant to the behavior that \nconstitutes true religion: "Mere talk about religion is only an intellec- \ntual exercise. . . .

Though classic \nwriters insisted on her chastity, older traditions gave her several \nconsorts, such as Hephaestus and Pan. 1 She was united with the phallic \nPallas, whose "Palladium" was a lingam, later Rome\'s greatest fetish. 2 \n\nAthene came from North Africa. She was the Libyan Triple \nGoddess Neith, Metis, Medusa, Anath, or Ath-enna. An inscription \nat Larnax-Lapithou named her Athene in Greek, Anat in Phoenician. 3 \nPre-Hellenic myths said she came from the uterus of Lake Tritonis \n(Three Queens) in Libya. 4 Egyptians sometimes called Isis Athene, \nwhich meant "I have come from myself." 5 \n\nGreeks claimed Athene was born from Zeus\'s head, after he \nSign of Athene swallowed her mother Metis i.e., Medusa, "Female Wisdom," \n\nformerly symbolized by the Gorgoneum, Athene\'s snake-haired mask, \ninvested with power to turn men to stone. 6 Gorgo, or Gorgon, was \nAthene\'s Destroyer aspect. 7 Funerary statues or phallic pillars were her \n"men turned to stone," perhaps even identified with the pillars of the \nParthenon which was seized by Christians at an unknown date in \nthe 5th or 6th century a.d. and rededicated as a temple of the virgin \nMary. 8 \n\n1.

This was a re-interpreta- \ntion of his primary earth-supporting function. As Prometheus was \nassociated with the Caucasus and Heracles with the "Pillars of \nHeracles" in the west, so Atlas was associated with the Atlas Mountains \nof Africa indicating that the Titans were originally divine pillars of \nthe heavens, upholding the world. Atlas might be compared to the \n\n\n\n74 \n\n\n\nVedic god Vishnu who took the form of a tortoise (Greek Tartarus) Atonement \n\nand supported the world on his back. \n\n\n\nAtonement \n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia the Day of Atonement corresponded to the \nbeginning of the New Year, when all sins were collectively purged for a \nnew time-cycle. The Jews\' Yom Kippur, Day of Atonement, was \nbased on the Sumero-Babylonian kupparu, an atonement ceremony in \nwhich a sheep was ceremonially loaded with all the community\'s sins, \nand killed. The sheep was an animal substitute for the man who in \nearlier times died as Sin Bearer, Savior, or Good Shepherd that is, \nDumuzi or Tammuz. \n\nA ram played the part of Sin Bearer at atonement festivals of \nEgypt, which is why Aries the Ram is still the zodiacal sign of the \nNew Year that began in March, by ancient reckoning. Egyptians called \nhim Amon the ram god; the Jews assimilated him to the paschal lamb \nand sacrificed him at Passover. \n\nAll over the world, the sheep stood for the shepherd as an \natonement-victim. In China the name Ch\'iang, "Shepherd," was \ngiven to war prisoners who provided sacrificial victims. The pictograph \nfor "shepherd" was a man with a knife severing his neck. 1 The dead \nshepherd was also called the Son of God. In Samarkand during the 2nd \ncentury B.C., "the Son of God died with the seventh moon ... all the \ninhabitants, without distinction, appear dressed in robes of black wool. \nThey go barefooted, striking their breasts, uttering loud wails and \nweeping copious tears. Three hundred persons, both men and women, \ngo about the fields scattering grass, and looking for the remains of the \nSon of God." 2 Such was a Chinese traveler\'s impression of the rite \nknown in Greece as the anagnorisis, search and discovery (see \nDrama). \n\nIsrael\'s law called for a goat to bear away the sins of the community \nto the god Azazel, whom the Syrians called Aziz, "the Lord\'s \nMessenger." 3 Having selected the scape-goat, the priest would "confess \nover him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their \ntransgressions in all their sins, putting them on the head of the goat" \n(Leviticus 16:21). A first goat was driven away, a second one was \nkilled, for no god would absolve sins without an offering of blood: \n"Almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without \nshedding of blood there is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22). \n\nAs development of the wool industry made it more profitable \nto keep sheep alive for their fleeces than to kill them for their meat, the \ngoat became a more popular sacrificial victim. The animals were \nsometimes skinned to produce copious shedding of blood for remission \n\n\n\n75 \n\n\n\nAtonement of sins. An incantation from the Shurpu series gives a magic rationale \n\nfor flaying a scape-goat: \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ m As this goat skin is pulled off and thrown into the fire, and the burning \n\nFlame consumes it, and it does not return to its goat, and it is no longer \ndyed (with blood), so the oath, the ban, the pain, the misery, the disease, \nthe sickness, the trespass, the misdeed, the crime, the sin, the disease \nwhich dwells in my body, my flesh, and my joints, may they be pulled off \nlike this goat skin, and may the ban depart and may I see the light. 4 \n\nEarly Greek myths evoke primitive totemism with goat gods \nflayed in atonement for the sins of others. Athene flayed the goat god \nPallas, or Pan, and made her aegis from his skin. 5 Phrygians called \nthe same god the satyr Marsyas, nailed to a pine tree and flayed in \natonement for a crime against Apollo. In Rome, goats were flayed at \nthe purification festival of the Lupercalia, where the dying satyr-god \nFaunus was offered to the Sabine mother-goddess Ops. 6 \n\nThe old Roman New Year was celebrated at the Ides of March \nand called the Mamuralia, carrying another trace of scapegoat- \nsacrifice. A man dressed in goatskins was led through the city in \nprocession, beaten with rods, and driven away into exile with the \nformula, "Out with hunger, in with health and wealth." 7 Ovid said the \nMarch scapegoat was a legendary smith named Mamurius, who \nforged coins representing each month of the year zodiacal sun- \nsymbols. \n\nSuch practices make it clear that scapegoat-sacrifices were formerly \nhuman, and the animals replaced human victims. Liturgical formulae \nnearly always sent human sins into oblivion along with the sacrificed \nanimal. Egyptians, killing the bull that represented Osiris, said the \nwhole nation\'s sins were placed on his head. 8 Animal sacrifice took a \nmore humane form in Tibet: at the New Year ceremony, three \nhorses and three dogs were smeared with red paint instead of flayed, \nthen dedicated to the temple. 9 \n\nChristian symbolism made Jesus the sacrificial Lamb of God slain \n\nto atone for sin like the paschal lamb. Some early Christian writers \n\ninsisted that animal sacrifice came first, and human sacrifice was a later, \n\n"higher" development: "God is a man-eater. For this reason men are \n\nsacrificed to him." 10 Among medieval theologians there was a general \n\nopinion that Jesus\'s sacrifice was not really effective; only "a few" \n\nwere saved by the Savior\'s death. St. Thomas Aquinas and others \n\nclaimed the vast majority of people were still doomed to eternal \n\nsuffering in hell. 11 Thus the theory of atonement for all time or for all \n\nhumanity was actually denied by the same church that propounded \n\nit as a basis for worldly power. \n\n1.

She was \nthe Destroyer whose function was to cut the thread of life that the first \nsister spun, and the second one wove. She was usually depicted as an \nold woman carrying a pair of shears. Like Kali the Destroyer, she was \nalso worshipped as a Goddess in her own right. In Parthia, the \n"Virgin-Land," she had her own holy city, Atropatene. Its modern \nname is Azerbaijan. 1 \n\n\n\nl.Thc \n\n\n\n173. \n\n\n\nAtropos \nAttis \n\n\n\nAttis \n\nThe cult of Attis strongly influenced early Christianity. \n\nAttis accompanied Cybele, the Great Mother of the Gods, \nbrought to Rome from Phrygia in 204 B.C. They were established in a \ntemple on the Vatican hill, where they remained for six centuries. 1 At \nfirst Attis was separated from, and subordinated to, the Goddess, \nwhom the emperor Augustus regarded as the Supreme Mother of \nRome. "The Romans tolerated Attis because, maintaining the tradi- \ntion of earlier days, they continued to regard Cybele as a national \nGoddess." 2 \n\nAttis was a son of the Goddess\'s earthly incarnation, the virgin \nNana, who miraculously conceived him by eating an almond or a \npomegranate, yonic symbols both. Thus he was a typical "god without a \nfather," the Virgin\'s son. He grew up to become a sacrificial victim \nand Savior, slain to bring salvation to mankind. His body was eaten by \nhis worshippers in the form of bread. 3 He was resurrected as "The \nMost High God, who holds the universe together." 4 His epiphany was \nannounced with the words, "Hail, Bridegroom, Hail, new Light." 5 \nLike his priests he was castrated, then crucified on a pine tree, whence \nhis holy blood poured down to redeem the earth. \n\nAttis\'s passion was celebrated on the 25th of March, exactly nine \nmonths before the solstitial festival of his birth, the 25th of Decem- \nber. The time of his death was also the time of his conception, or \nre-conception. To mark the event when Attis entered his mother to \nbeget his reincarnation, his tree-phallus was carried into her sacred \ncavern. Thus the virgin mother Nana was actually the Goddess \nherself: she who was called Inanna by the Sumerians, Mari-Anna by the \nCanaanites, Anna Perenna by the Sabines, and Nanna, mother of the \ndying god Balder, in northern Europe. 6 \n\nChristians claimed the same dates for the conception and birth of \ntheir savior. The usual quarrels ensued. The Christians resorted to \ntheir favorite argument, that the devil had established pagan Mysteries \nin imitation of Christianity before there was a Christianity. Tertullian \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens Ter- \ntullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Car- \nthage of pagan parents. \n\n\n\n77 \n\n\n\nAttis said, "The devil by the mysteries of his idols, imitates even the main \n\nparts of the divine mysteries." 7 \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Followers of Attis eventually lost their sacrificial day to the Chris- \n\ntians. Justinian ruled that March 25 would be known as the day of \nthe Annunciation, or Lady Day. Naturally, the day of the Annunciation \nwas the day of Jesus\'s conception, so that he, like Attis, could be born \nnine months later at the winter solstice, as were all gods assimilated \nto the sun and called Light of the World. 8 \n\nMarch 25 was also the day when Blessed Virgin Juno miraculous- \nly conceived her savior-son Mars by eating her own magic lily, which \nis why March was named after this god and why medieval France called \nLady Day Notre Dame de Mars. The date was officially Christian- \nized by the tenth Council of Toledo in 656 a.d. as the Festival of the \nMother of God. But its symbol remained a pagan sign of the yoni. 9 \nMars had a Phrygian counterpart, the satyr Marsyas, likewise hung on a \ntree, and likewise a son of Cybele. It was said that he and Attis were \nthe same god. 10 \n\nThe day of Attis\'s death was Black Friday, or the Day of Blood. \nHis image was carried to the temple and bound to the tree, escorted \nby "reed-bearers" (cannophori) with the reed scepters representing re- \ngenerated phalli and new fertility. 11 During the ceremonies, initiates \ncastrated themselves in imitation of the castrated god, and presented \ntheir severed genitals to the Goddess along with those of the gelded \nbull sacrificed at the Taurobolium. 12 All these male remnants were \ndeposited in the sacred cave of the Great Mother. 15 \n\nThe god died and was buried. He descended into the underworld. \nOn the third day he rose again from the dead. His worshippers were \ntold: "The god is saved; and for you also will come salvation from your \ntrials." 14 This day was the Carnival or Hilaria, also known as the Day \nof Joy. People danced in the streets and went about in disguise, \nindulging in horseplay and casual love affairs. 15 This was the Sun- \nday; the god arose in glory as the solar deity of a new season. Christians \never afterward kept Easter Sunday with carnival processions derived \nfrom the mysteries of Attis. Like Christ, Attis arose when "the sun \nmakes the day for the first time longer than the night." 16 \n\nNaassenes of the 3rd century a.d. worshipped Attis as a syncretic \nmixture of deities. One of their hymns said, "Of Attis I will sing, of \nRhea\'s son, not sounding his praises with rolling drums, nor on the reed, \nnor with the roar of Ida\'s Curetes, but as the Muse of Phoebus on the \nlyre I will blend the strains. Euhoi, Euhan, he is Pan, he is Bacchus, he \nis the shepherd of the white constellations." 17 \n\nInscriptions of the 4th century gave Attis the title of Menotyrannus, \nfrom Greek tyrannos, "lord," plus Men or Mennu, Osiris as the \nresurrected, ithyphallic moon-bull, "the Lord Who Impregnates His \nMother." 18 \n\n\n\n78 \n\n\n\nPagans sometimes celebrated the Hilaria at the end of their Holy \nWeek, bringing it to April 1 and the carnival of the April Fool, or \nCarnival King, or Prince of Love, all originally synonymous with Attis. \nHe was also identified with Green George of the old Roman Palilia, \nhonored on Easter Monday with sacrificial hanging of the god\'s effigy \non a sacred tree. People of the 18th century still said the 25th of \nMarch used to be New Year\'s Day, while April 1 stood at the "octaves" \nterminating the sacred week. 19 \n\nSome Christians claimed Jesus\'s crucifixion took place on April 1, \nso the Fool of the April Fool\'s Day processions became Christ \ncarrying his cross and enduring the mockery of the mob. But the spring \nHoly Week was not really Christian. Its origin was a universal Indo- \nEuropean tradition of extreme antiquity, probably traceable to the Holi \nfestivals of India which celebrated the rebirth of spring with joyous \norgies. 20 \n\n1.

Oracles were augustae \nin the semi-matriarchal "republican" period. The term was later applied \nto male priests, then to emperors. An "august" man was one filled \nwith the spirit of the Goddess. 1 Augur, the old name for a seer, meant \n"increaser," once referring to the mother-priestess. 2 The first emper- \nor Augustus took his title from the Great Mother of the Gods, \npresumed incarnate in his wife Livia Augusta. Their house stood \nopposite the temple of the Great Mother, whom Augustus honored as \nthe national Goddess. 3 \n\nAmong European pagans the month of August began with one of \nthe Goddess\'s major festivals, Lammas Eve, from Hlaf-mass, "the \nFeast of Bread." The secret worship of Ops, Ceres, Demeter, or Juno \nAugusta continued throughout the Middle Ages in the rites ad- \ndressed to the Lammas corn-mother who ruled the harvest-month. \n"For a seventeenth-century Scot to say \'he (or she) was born in \nAugust\', was to imply high praise and recognition of a well-skilled \nperson\'. August, the month of the Lammas towers, the month when \nthe Irish dancers moved around the female effigy, was the right time for \nbirth. Then the Lammas moon was at work, on behalf of new \nchildren, and the new harvest." 4 \n\nChurchmen repeatedly tried to obliterate the Goddess\'s connec- \ntions with her harvest month.

Every god was a Baal. The title was introduced into Ireland \nvia Phoenician colonies in Spain, and became the Irish Bel or Bial, Lord \nofBeltain. 1 \n\nOld Testament Jews worshipped many baalim as past or present \nconsorts of the Goddess Zion (Hosea 2:2-8). Yahweh shared these other \ngods\' temples for a long time, until his priesthood managed to isolate his \ncult and suppress the others. 2 Some of the baalim revered in Israel \nwere: Sin, the moon god of Sinai; Molech (Melek), the "king" and sun \ngod of Tyre; Horus, the Egyptian Golden Calf whose image was \nmade by Aaron; Baal-Peor, a phallic "Lord of the Cleft" (or yoni); \nNehushtan, the "fiery flying serpent" of lightning, made by Moses (2 \nKings 18:4); Chemosh, the Babylonian sun god Shamash, incarnate in \nSamson (or Shams-on, the sun); Melchizedek, the god of Salem; \nEtana, or Ethan, the Canaanite Eytan who "went up to heaven"; Baal- \nRimmon, the Lord of the Pomegranate impersonated by Solomon; \nBaal-Berith, the Canaanites\' "God of the Covenant"; El, or Elias, the \nsun god Helios to whom Jesus called from the cross; Joseph, Jacob, \nand Israel, who were not men but tribal gods. 2 \n\nSince nearly all gods were sacrificial victims in their earthly \nincarnations, Baal may have been derived from Sanskrit Bala or Bali, \na sacrificial offering. 5 The Semitic melek, "king," came from Phoeni- \ncian molk, a votive offering, because early kings were not only gods \nbut also victims. 4 (See Kingship.) \n\nBaal was often used as the title of a mortal king, especially one \nwhose reign might be terminated by a ritual sacrifice. In the time of \nEsarhaddon of Assyria, the king of Tyre was named Baal, or "God." In \nthe 10th century B.C., kings of Byblos bore names like Yehimilk \n(God-king), Abibaal (Father-god), and Baalshamen (Heavenly Father). 5 \n\nBaal became a favorite Christian name for a devil, because biblical \nwriters denounced all the baalim indiscriminately as devils (2 Chroni- \ncles 1 1:15; 1 Corinthians 10:20; Revelation 9:20). Still, the northern \nEuropean cognate Bal, Bel, Bael, or Balder retained the affection of \ncommoners. 6 Baal was still the patron of the Beltain feast in 18th- \ncentury Scotland. To make the crops thrive, Scandinavians burned \nhis effigy at midsummer in "Balder\'s Balefires" throughout Denmark, \nNorway, and Sweden. 7 \n\n1. Joyce, 279. 2. Reinach, 201; Frazer,G.B., 341. 3.

Commandments on \n\nthe tablets were based on the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, received \n\nby the Babylonian king from the god Shamash. 1 These, in turn, were \n\nbased on the tablets of law given the first god by his Great Mother, \n\nTiamat. 2 \n\nThough both tablets and title were claimed by the Judeo-Christian \nGod, the name of Baal-Berith was attached to a devil, often invoked \nby medieval authors on magic, who were apparently unaware that they \ncalled upon the God of the Covenant. Weyer placed Baal-Berith in a \nposition suiting his ancient function, however. In the royal hierarchy of \nhell he was Minister of Treaties. 3 Though churchmen had small use \nfor the heretic Weyer, yet they used this precedent to assign the de- \nmonic pact to Baal-Berith. In 1335a witch named Catherine Delort \nwas burned for signing a pact with "the demon Berit." 4 \n\n1. Hooke, M.E.M* 142, 147. 2. Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 287. \n3. Waite, B.C.M., 186-87. 4. J.B.

Beelzebub \n\n\n\nBaal-Zebub \n\n"Lord of Flies," a god of Ekron in Philistia, to whose oracle King \nAhaziah of Israel sent messengers in quest of healing magic (2 Kings \n1:2). Like Hermes Psychopomp, his title meant the same as Lord of \nDeath or Conductor of Souls, because flies were common forms taken \nby souls in search of rebirth. Mothers of many mythic heroes \nmiraculously conceived them by swallowing their souls in fly shape. 1 \nEtain, legendary Irish queen married to Ochy Airem, and Cu \nChulainn are examples from popular Celtic myth. \n\nThe Pharisees called Baal-Zebub a "prince of devils," apparently \nbecause it was thought he could cure people possessed by lesser devils \n(Matthew 12:24). One or two passing references to this "prince of \ndevils" in the New Testament sufficed to establish Beelzebub as an \nalternative name for Satan, and flies as diabolic manifestations in \nmedieval Christendom. \n\nSt. Bernard once exorcised a cloud of flies, which instantly \ndropped dead at the sound of his holy words and had to be shoveled \nout of his church in heaps. 2 \n\nFly-devils were still firmly believed in during the late 16th century. \nWhen a young Viennese girl suffered from cramps in 1 583, Jesuit \npriests diagnosed her case as demonic possession.

The ziggurat restored by \nNebuchadnezzar was a "temple of the seven spheres of the world." It \nhelped established universal belief in the seven heavens, corresponding \nto the seven planetary spheres. Christians and Moslems also adopted \nthis view of the cosmos. The Koran says Allah made seven heavens and \nseven underground spheres, the seven hells. 4 \n\nWhen ziggurats were abandoned and became ruinous, their mud- \nbrick construction crumbling, later nomadic peoples assumed the \ngods were angered by the pride of the elder races and broke down their \nheaven-aspiring constructions. The Babel myth is found all over the \nworld, including India and Mexico. It was familiar in the Greek story of \nthe giants who piled up mountains to reach heaven. Hindus said it \nwas not a tower but a great tree that grew up to heaven, angering \nBrahma, who cut off its branches and threw them down. From each \nbranch grew a separate wata tree that gave humanity another separate \nlanguage. 5 \n\nBerossus said the Babylonian heaven-mountain was destroyed by \nwinds, which blew a diversity of tongues among men. The first part \nof this premise was certainly not irrational, since drying and wind- \nerosion were major causes of the destruction of mud-brick structures. \nBerossus\'s story surfaced many centuries later in the Armenian myth of \nthe holy mountain built by giants. It was blown down by winds, while \n"unknown words were at the same time blown about among men." 6 \n\nThe same story was told in the western hemisphere. Choctaw \nIndians said their own ancestors piled up stones to build a mountain \nthat would reach heaven, but it was blown down by winds, whereupon \npeople found themselves speaking different languages. 7 In Central \nAmerica the heaven-reaching pyramid of Cholula was built by giants un- \nder the leadership of Xelhua. The angry gods broke it down with light- \nning and sent different, mutually incomprehensible languages to earth. 8 \n\n1. White 2, 170. 2.Hcx)ke,M.E.M., 138. 3. Eliade, M.E.R., 14. \n4.

Sometimes \nthey were ordinary \ncakes marked with a \nsymbol of the sacrifice, \nlike the Christian \nhost (from Latin hostia, \n"victim"). \n\n\n\nBalder \n\nNorwegian name for the god Bel, or Baal, sacrificed as a son of \nFather Odin. He descended into the womb of Mother Hel, the \nUnderworld. At doomsday, Ragnarok, he would return to earth in \nSecond Coming. He would establish a new earth and a new heaven \nafter the passing of the old destructive gods and their world. \n\nBalder\'s effigy is still burned at Beltain fires in Scotland and \nIreland. Scandinavians knew them as Balder\'s Balefires. His was the \nspirit inhabiting the Beltain cake, an effigy of god-flesh like the Christian \nhost, sometimes man-shaped like the symbolic dough "victims" of \nthe Far East. 1 Such pagan hosts probably gave rise to the living \nGingerbread Man of the fairy tale. 2 \n\nLike Heracles, Siegfried, and other solar heros, Balder stood for \nthe idea of regeneration through cremation. His funeral was the \nViking\'s dissolution in both fire and water; he was sent to sea on a \nburning ship. This was arranged by a Goddess called Hyrrokkin, \n"Fire-shrunk," one of the Elder Deities.

"When the banshee \nloves those she calls, the song is a low, soft chant giving notice, \nindeed, of the proximity of death but with a tenderness of tone that \nreassures the one destined to die and comforts the survivors; rather a \nwelcome than a warning." 4 To others, she came like a bad death, full of \nhorror. \n\n1.

Shah, 225.2. Knight, S.L., 202. \n\n\n\nBaptism \n\nIn 418 a.d., a Catholic church council decided that every human \nchild is born demonic as a result of its sexual conception, thus automati- \ncally damned unless baptized. 1 During a Catholic baptismal \nceremony the priest still addresses the baby, "I exorcise thee, thou \nunclean spirit. . . . Hear thy doom, O Devil accursed, Satan ac- \ncursed!" 2 The exorcism is euphemistically described as "a means to \nremove impediments to grace resulting from the effects of original sin \nand the power of Satan over fallen nature." 3 But it is obvious from the \nfolk belief still widespread, that the church\'s teaching was that every \nnewborn infant before baptism belonged to the devil. 4 St. Augustine\'s \ndoctrine of original sin laid the foundation for this idea, and Tertul- \nlian said every baby is born evil; its soul is "unclean" and "actively \nsinful" before baptism. 5 Medieval theologians held that any infant still \nin the womb is doomed to eternal damnation. 6 The Oedipal jealousies \nof men apparently developed these ideas, since few women would \nhave pictured babies screaming in an eternity of torture in hellfire, \nsimply because no priest had sprinkled them with water before they \nperished. \n\nIndeed, priests refused to baptize a child within forty days of its \nbirth, for both mother and infant were considered impure (hence too \ndangerous for priests to touch) during that period. "An unbaptized \nchild, as well as a woman between childbirth and churching, was \ndesignated as heathen." 7 The real reason for this "heathenism" appears \nin numerous folk beliefs: it was the birth magic of the ancient \nGoddess that claimed both women and their infants in the performance \nof her Mysteries. In the north it is still said that children dying \nunbaptized go to Frau Holda, or Hel, or Perchta, the underground \nMother. 8 In the Hebrides, the Goddess\'s protective ritual is still used \nto preserve children during the perilous pre-baptismal period: a torch is \ndaily carried around the cradle as in old pre-Christian custom. 9 Some \ntraditional ballads deny the Catholic doctrine that women dying in \nchildbed or infants dying unbaptized must go to hell; they claim, \nrather, that such individuals pass into a pagan heaven. Mexican peasants \nstill say they go to "a place of delight in the temple of the sun." 10 \n\nThus, paganism was kinder to infants and their mothers than \nChristianity, so that theologians often felt called upon to explain \nGod\'s apparent cruelty in allowing infants to die unbaptized, so con- \ndemning them before they had a chance for salvation. In the 16th \nand 17th centuries, churchmen insisted that God\'s cruelty was perfectly \njust. Said Martin Del Rio, S.J.: "If, as is not uncommon, God permits \n\n\n\n90 \n\n\n\nchildren to be killed before they have been baptized, it is to prevent their Barabbas \n\ncommitting in later life those sins which would make their damnation Barbara, Saint \n\nmore severe. In this, God is neither cruel nor unjust, since, by the mere ^^^^^^^^^^ \nfact of original sin, the children have already merited death." n \n\nIt was customary to refuse baptism altogether to those thought to \nhave been conceived out of wedlock, or sinfully. American church- \nmen often refused to baptize children born on Sunday, because it was \nthought children were always born on the same day of the week as \ntheir conception, and marital relations on Sunday were forbidden. 12 \n\nModern theologians have trouble explaining why baptism should \nbe necessary. Few educated parents seriously believe their infants are \ndoomed to eternal torture unless splashed with a little water in a church. \nThe biblical "fall" that provided the original rationale has long since \nbeen relegated to the realm of myth. 13 The primitive notion of the \npublic name-giving ritual seems to be all that is left to justify the \nformalities: no more than an excuse for people to dress up and get \ntogether, to celebrate a new life in the clan. Perhaps it should be \nremembered that this function was once the exclusive concern of \nmothers and Goddesses. \n\n1. H. Smith, 238. 2. de Givry, 157. 3. Encyc. Brit, "Exorcism." \n4.

Within the mountain dwelt the \nheathen dead, "bewitched men and women" who spent their time in \ndancing, lovemaking, and other pleasures until the day of doom. 1 In \nother words, St. Barbara was none other than the Fairy Queen. \n\nAs a spurious martyr, Barbara followed the usual pattern: she was a \nbeautiful virgin, tortured by her evil pagan father to make her \nrenounce Christianity. She remained steadfast, so her father killed her. \nThen God struck the father dead with a lightning bolt, unfortunately \na few minutes too late to save Barbara.

He was inserted into the Gospels as an apostle, but hagiogra- \nphers gave him a different origin. He was called a son of "Prince \nPtolomeus," crucified in Armenia, and flayed like the satyr Marsyas (see \nMars). Icons showed him holding a moon-sickle, the sacrificial knife \nof the Middle East. 1 \n\nAn alternative history made Bartholomew a missionary to India, \nwhere he overthrew the idols of the oddly non-Indian deities Astarte \nand Baal-Berith. With many miracles, Bartholomew converted the \nking of that country to Christianity, but the king\'s brother was \nunaccountably permitted to crucify, flay, and behead the saint \nafterward. 2 \n\nSpurious relics of the saint were installed in the Roman healing \nshrine of Asclepius, which was taken over by Christians and remained \nthe Hospital of San Bartolommeo up to the 20th century.* \n\n1.

As the serpent-haired \nGorgon head represented women\'s "wise blood" and guarded men- \nstrual mysteries that men were forbidden to behold, so there was a \npopular medieval belief that a hair taken from the head of a menstru- \nating woman and buried in the earth would turn into a serpent or \nbasilisk. 1 Superstitious folk supposed that all the serpents on the \nGorgon\'s head were basilisks, which derived their evil eyes from her \nown deadly glance. \n\nl.Rawson.A.T., 165-66. \n\n\n\nBassareus \n\nLydian fox god, a totemic form of Orpheus or Dionysus, whose \nMaenads were sometimes called Bassarids because they wore fox \n\n\n\n92 \n\n\n\nskins. 1 As a pagan deity, the fox became the popular trickster-hero of \nmedieval folklore, where he appeared as Reynard or Renaud.

Herodotus said that in Egypt, "All cats that die are \ncarried to certain sacred houses, where being first embalmed, they are \nburied in the city of Bubastis." \' The Greeks identified Bast with \nArtemis or Diana, also called the mother of cats, and claimed the great \nshrine of Bubastis was built in her honor. 2 The cat\'s legendary nine \nlives stemmed from Artemis as the mother of the nine Muses, corre- \nsponding to the Egyptian Ennead of nine primordial deities.

In Rome, each paterfamilias went \nthrough an annual ceremony of exorcising ancestral spirits by throwing \nbeans behind him at midnight, nine times enjoining the manes to \nleave the house. 2 \n\nAnother Roman ceremony on the twelfth day after the midwinter \nsolstice (Epiphany) recalled ancient customs of choosing a sacred \nking. It was called the Festival of Kings Created or Elected by Beans, \nthe beans evidently representing women, the choosing carried out by \ndrawing black or white beans. Later, dice were used, and a ceremonial \nking-for-the-night called Basilicus was chosen by the "Venus" throw. \nThe ceremony persisted in medieval England, where the Twelfth- \nNight plum cake contained one bean, and the man who received the \nbean was declared king of the festival. 3 \n\nSome overlapping esoteric meanings of beans may be found in the \nSanskrit word mudra, "kidney beans," also "woman," and a "magical \ngesture," the benevolent spell cast by a Shakti. 4 The influx of Tantric \nsymbols into medieval Europe probably gave rise to Jack\'s beanstalk, \nresembling the Ladder of Heaven in that it was a soul-bridge: "the myth \n\n\n\n93 \n\n\n\nBeata of the vine that once joined earth and sky," in the paradisal time \n\nBehemoth when men knew the way to heaven or thought they did. 5 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ 1.

Sometimes \nthey were persecuted for heresy and witchcraft. \n\n\n\nBeelzebub \n\nSee Baal-zebub. \n\nBehemoth \n\nBiblical name of the Indian elephant god Ganesha, the "Lord of \nHosts." \' His title was adopted by the Jewish Jehovah, during the period \nwhen he was married to the Virgin Goddess Anath, or Neith, in the \ntemple of Elephantine in Egypt. Jewish mercenaries stationed there wor- \nshipped the elephant-headed, virgin-born Lord of Hosts as their own \nYaho (or, Yahweh). 2 At the time, the Jewish God was a subordinate \nspouse of the Goddess who was hailed as "Queen of Heaven and \nmistress of all the gods." 3 \n\nThe same Virgin Goddess was the mother, as well as the bride, of \nthe elephant bull-god, according to the standard myth of divine incest \ncreated by identification of Father and Son. In India the mother of \nGanesha was Parvati, virgin form of Kali. She made him from her \nown "body-dew" (menstrual blood). A true archetypal son, he guarded \nher "gate" (yoni) against the entrance of All-father Shiva. For this \nOedipal offense he was slain, but resurrected. 4 Upon the same virgin \nmother under her other name of Maya (comparable to Mari, the \nother name of Anath), he begot the next incarnation of the Son of the \nLord of Hosts: Buddha, the Enlightened One. \n\nThe elephant-god was not forgotten by the Jews, but he was \ndissociated from the later concept of Yahweh, and diabolized. He \nbecame the demon Behemoth. In this guise he appeared in medieval \ndemonologies and grimoires, still wearing the elephant head of Shiva- \nGanesha. 5 \n\nYet traces of the earlier divine elephant could be found in Jewish \ntradition. Rabbinical sources said the Passover feast commemorated \nmore than one god. The lamb stood for the Firstborn. The fish \nrepresented Leviathan, the original wise serpent-deity of Levites. \n\n\n\n94 \n\n\n\nThe hard-boiled egg represented Ziz, or Aziz, or Azazel, the god of \natonement sacrifices.

Through \nwearing the bear\'s skin, a warrior acquired the bear\'s fighting spirit \nand the grace of the ursine Goddess who was often a teacher of the \nmartial arts. "Berserk" came to mean one possessed by battle-frenzy, \ncareless of his own safety, unable to feel fear. \n\nTotemic descent from the She-Bear characterized several old \nEuropean clans. The Orsini or Ursini family were "bear\'s children," \ncarrying a bear on their coat of arms. William of Auvergne, bishop of \nParis in the 16th century, solemnly explained the origin of the Orsinis \nby saying a bear\'s semen is very like a man\'s, therefore it was quite \npossible for a bear to beget human children, presumably on a human \n\n\n\n95 \n\n\n\nBible mother. 1 The story reflects contemporary theological opinion that only \n\na male can be a true parent. Nothing was said about a she-bear\'s \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m ovum being like a woman\'s, nor was there a human father who might \nhave begotten children on a bear mother. \n\n1. Summers, W, 243. \n\n\n\nBible \n\nThis word for a holy book came from Byblos, the City of the Great \nMother, the oldest continuously occupied temple in the world. The \nGoddess called Astarte, Baalat, Hathor, etc. patronized learning, \nand her priestesses collected a library of papyrus scrolls. Therefore, \nGreeks called any papyrus byblos, which came to mean any holy \nbook. Hence the "Bible." \' \n\nScholars have found in the Bible\'s numerous layers of additions \nand corrections a substrate of the former Semitic matriarchy, such as \nthe Book of Ruth with its matrilineal and matrilocal marriage customs, \nand the Book of Judges with its feminine government of Israel \n(Judges 4:4). In several books the word translated "God" is really a \nfeminine plural, "Goddesses," especially in reference to the matriar- \nchal functions of lawgiving, avenging crimes, and bestowing the \nimperium of leadership. 2 \n\nSome of the miracles attributed to biblical heroes were copied from \nolder myths of the Goddess. Joshua\'s arrest of the sun was formerly \ncredited to priestesses of Isis, Hecate, and the Thessalian Great Mother, \nwho were said to stop heavenly bodies in their courses, and lengthen \nnight or day at will. 3 Moses\'s flowering rod, river of blood, and tablets of \nthe law were all symbols of the ancient Goddess. His miracle of \ndrawing water from a rock was first performed by Mother Rhea after she \ngave birth to Zeus, and by Atalanta with the help of Artemis. 4 His \nmiracle of drying up waters to travel dry-shod was earlier performed by \nIsis, or Hathor, on her way to Byblos. 5 \n\nThe greatest mistake of religious authorities in the western \nworld was their view of the Bible as intrinsically different from other \nancient scriptures, in that it was dictated word for word by God, not \ncollected slowly, rewritten and mis-written, revised and worked over by \nhuman beings for a long time. The notion that the Bible did not \nevolve haphazardly, like most other holy writings of the same period, \npersisted almost up to the present day, even among people who \nshould have known better. \n\nAccording to the prevailing myth of biblical origins, the Old \nTestament was supposed to have been translated from Hebrew to \nGreek by seventy-two translators sent to Ptolemy by Eleazar, a Jewish \nhigh priest, in the 3rd century B.C., hence its name, Septuagint. \nPtolemy locked the scholars in individual cells on the island Pharos, \nwhere each one made his own Greek version in exactly seventy-two \n\n\n\n96 \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndays. Each translation agreed exactly, in every word, with the other \nseventy-one translations. \n\nOf course this never happened. The Bible\'s real history was far less \ntidy. A collection appeared in the first century b.c. and again in the \nfirst century a.d. to be accepted by the Jews of the Diaspora as sacred, \nand passed on to Christians. In both Jewish and Christian hands the \npapyri underwent many changes. In the 4th century a.d., St. Jerome \ncollected some Hebrew manuscripts and edited them to produce the \nLatin Vulgate, a Bible of considerable inaccuracy, differing markedly \nfrom Jerome\'s stem texts. \n\nThe King James Bible relied mostly on a Greek text collected and \nedited by Erasmus in the 16th century, which in turn relied on a \nByzantine collection assembled gradually at Constantinople between \nthe 4th and 8th centuries. A few older texts have been discovered: the \nCodex Sinaiticus, the Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Alexandrinus, and \nthe Chester Beatty papyri. All are fragmentary, all differ from one \nanother and from the King James version. There are no known portions \nof the Bible older than the 4th century a.d. 6 \n\nThe Revised Version of the New Testament published in 1881 \ntried to correct some of the more glaring errors. It erased the spurious \nfinal twelve verses of Mark, which were late interpolations including the \nwords that caused centuries of suffering: "He that believeth not shall \nbe damned." It eliminated the fraudulent translation "Joseph and his \nmother," intended to preserve the dogma of the virgin birth, and \nrestored the original "his father and his mother." It omitted the forged \ninterpolation intended to preserve the dogma of the trinity: "For \nthere are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and \nthe Holy Ghost: and these three are one." These words appeared \nnowhere before the 1 5th century a.d. However, the Catholic church \ninsisted on retaining the forgery. Churchmen\'s argument was: "How, \nif these verses were an interpolation, could the Holy Spirit, who guides \nand directs the Church, have allowed her to regard this lofty affirma- \ntion of the Trinity as authentic, and permitted its insertion in the official \nedition of the sacred books?" In 1897 the Congregation of the Index, \nwith the approval of Pope Leo XIII, forbade any further research into \nthe origins of this text. 7 \n\nTraditionally, the church forbade not only research but even \nreading of the Bible by laymen. Throughout the Middle Ages, \npossession of a Bible written in the vernacular was a crime punished by \nburning at the stake. 8 With the Reformation came Bible-reading in \nsearch of a new basis for faith; but in the process were found many new \ngrounds for skepticism. \n\nRichard Simon\'s 17th-century Critical History of the Old Testa- \nment exhibited the now well-known internal evidence that the books \nof Moses were not written by Moses but were compiled by many hands \nat a much later date. Bishop Bossuet pronounced this work of \nscholarship "a mass of impieties," drove its author out of the Oratory, \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\n97 \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\nMaurice Jones \n\nAuthor of The New \nTestament in the \nTwentieth Century, \n1934. \n\n\n\nand ordered the entire first edition burned. Dr. Alexander Geddes, a \nCatholic scholar, translated the Old Testament in 1792 with a critical \nvolume proving that the Pentateuch could not have been written by \nMoses, nor at any time prior to the reign of David. He was denounced \nas "a would-be corrector of the Holy Ghost." 9 \n\nAs the years passed, it became increasingly clear that the Holy \nGhost needed correcting. Seven clerical scholars published Essays \nand Reviews in 1860, defining the new science of Bible criticism. They \nwere denounced, and two were suspended from office; but they took \ntheir case to court, and won. In 1 869 Kuenen\'s The Religion of Israel \nestablished Bible criticism as a valid field of investigation. He was \nfollowed by many others in Holland, Germany, and France. In 1889 \nthe book of biblical essays called Lux Mundi gave up all pretense of \nthe scriptures\' historicity or divine inspiration, admitting that the Bible is \na confused mass of myth, legend, and garbled history, often contra- \ndicting provable facts. 10 \n\nNaturally, there was constant opposition to the efforts of the \nscholars. Many 19th-century churchmen insisted that the Bible\'s only \nauthor was God. Dean Burgon said, "The Bible is the very utterance of \nthe Eternal; as much God\'s own word as if high heaven were open \nand we heard God speaking to us with human voice. Every book is in- \nspired alike, and is inspired entirely." Dr. Baylee said the Bible is \n"infallibly accurate; all its histories and narrations of every kind are \nwithout any inaccuracy." Dr. Hodge declared that the books of the \nBible are "one and all, in thought and verbal expression, in substance, \nand in form, wholly the work of God, conveying with absolute \naccuracy and divine authority all that God meant to convey without \nhuman additions and admixtures." 11 Apparently none of these gen- \ntlemen were familiar with the earlier contradictory texts; nor had they \nread the Bible closely enough to see the many passages where God \ncontradicted himself. \n\nThe real point was that organized religions had an economic \ninterest in maintaining literal interpretation of biblical myths. Guigne- \nbert says, "The doctrine of the inerrancy of the Bible . . . necessarily \nplaced theology in an attitude of surly and sanguinary hostility toward \nthe exact and experimental sciences, which it will not abandon save \nmost reluctantly and after as much delay as possible. . . . [Mjethods \nhave changed, the illusions still current have decreased, but its spirit is \nscarcely altered." 12 \n\nWhen the theologians began to give in, they complained that \nviewing the Bible as myth would destroy the whole structure that \ntheir livelihood and self-respect depended on. After David Straus\'s \nLebenjesu disposed of the historicity of the Gospel stories, and \nRenan\'s Vie de Jesus showed that the Gospels cannot be taken as literal \ntruth but only as romantic symbolism, the Rev. Maurice Jones \nexclaimed, "If the Christ-Myth theory is true, and if Jesus never lived, \n\n\n\n98 \n\n\n\nthe whole civilized world has for close upon two thousand years lain Bible \n\nunder the spell of a lie." 13 The Archbishop of Canterbury found it \nimpossible to deny the Bible\'s apparent lies, and began to backtrack _. \n\nwith his plaintive question, "May not the Holy Spirit make use of myth \nand legend?" 14 \n\nObviously the Bible was full of myths and legends, but most \northodox theologians had no idea of their meaning. One reason was \nthat they didn\'t study the corresponding myths and legends of other \ncultures ancient paganism, modern mysticism, the non-Christian \nbeliefs of people both civilized and uncivilized throughout the rest of \nthe world. Christian missionaries thought theirs was the only pipeline \nto divinity, the deities of all other people throughout the world were \ndevils, and the myths of the Bible were absolutely true whereas all \nother myths were absolutely false. \n\nNowadays such crude beliefs seem no less superstitious than the \nprimitive animisnvthat the missionaries sought to destroy. Yet an \neven darker blot on the history of Christian missions was their arrogant \nvandalism burning books and artworks, smashing images, forbid- \nding the songs and poems of heathen tradition instead of listening and \nrecording them in order to understand the people, to display a decent \nrespect for what alien races held sacred, as the pagan Romans did in the \ndays of their empire. It may well have been that, had the missionaries \nbeen willing to listen and learn, they would have discovered the \nmythology of the Bible all over again in other offshoots from its \noriginal sources; for all peoples, nearly everywhere in the world, shared \nthe same fables of the creation, the flood, the magic garden with its \ntree of life and its primal couple, the wise serpent, the heaven-piercing \ntower, the divided waters, the chosen people, the virgin mothers, the \nsaviors, and all the rest. It has been said both testaments of the Bible are \nonly recent and relatively corrupt derivations from a world-wide cycle \nof archetypal myths. 15 \n\nLeast of all were righteous Christians prepared to understand \nthat their awe of the Bible rested on a foundation of magical supersti- \ntion: it was, and is, a fetish. Legal oaths were taken in physical contact \nwith a Bible because of a very primitive belief in its destructive mana, \nwhich would automatically punish perjurors. Both Jews and Chris- \ntians used their Bible for divination, just as a witch might use a crystal \nball, an African might use a thunder-stone, or a Roman augur might \nuse the sacred chickens. Bibliomancy (taking omens from the Bible) was \nsometimes deplored, but from the 4th to the 14th centuries was \n"repeatedly practiced by Kings, Bishops, and Saints." 16 St. Augustine \nfrankly recommended taking omens from the Bible "in all cases of \nspiritual difficulty." 17 Even in this "enlightened" age, in both Europe \nand America, the Bible is still used to give omens. 18 \n\nA favorite biblical method for discovering a thief easily lent itself to \nconscious legerdemain. The name of the accused was written on a \n\n\n\n99 \n\n\n\nBible \n\n\n\nRobert Ingersoll \n\n(1833-1899) American \nlawyer and lecturer, \nAttorney General of the \nstate of Illinois; an \noutspoken popularizer \nof Bible criticism. \n\nJosephine Henry \n\n19th-century Kentucky \nsuffragist and pam- \nphleteer, active in the \nwomen\'s rights \nmovement. \n\nElizabeth Cady \n\nStanton (1815-1902) \nOne of the leaders of \nthe women\'s rights \nmovement in the \nU.S.; an associate of \nSusan B.

The diviner recited Psalm 50:18: "When thou \nsawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker \nwith adulterers." The guilt of the accused was proven if the key was \nfound turned around afterward. 19 \n\nDespite the many discoveries and clarifications made by biblical \nscholars in the last century or so, the average Christian\'s attitude \ntoward the Bible is still hardly more sophisticated than this simple- \nminded magic. Most churchmen see to it that their congregations are \nnot told the true origins of biblical myths. The most primitive or \nunattractive of these are constantly re-interpreted as deep allegories \nor metaphorical fables, intended by their divine author to wait two \nthousand years or more for a correct explanation. Yet the real \nexplanation of the sources of these stories, uncovered by the careful \nresearches of the higher critics, is seldom mentioned. Likewise \nignored are many of the truly awkward passages such as "Thou shalt not \nsuffer a witch to live," or God\'s frequent commands to wage \nmerciless war, which no amount of exegesis can fit into a more tolerant \nethic. 20 \n\nErroneous but traditional views of Bible origins and meanings are \ndoggedly preserved by male chauvinists in particular, since the \ncanonical books were deliberately selected and edited to wipe out all \nfeminine images of divinity and sanction religious suppression of \nwomen. Robert Ingersoll pointed out that "As long as woman regards \nthe Bible as the charter of her rights, she will be the slave of man." Jo- \nsephine Henry grumbled, "The Bible records that God created woman \nby a method different from that employed in bringing into life any \nother creature, then cursed her for seeking knowledge." Elizabeth \nStanton said there is no escape from the Bible\'s "degrading teaching" \nas to the position of women, and advised women to boycott churches. \n"It is not commendable for women to get up fairs and donation \nparties for churches in which the gifted of their sex may neither pray, \npreach, share in the offices and honors, nor have a voice in the \nbusiness affairs, creeds and discipline, and from whose altars come forth \nBiblical interpretations in favor of woman\'s subjection." 21 \n\nOne of the erroneous notions that still keep Christian women \nshackled to their Bible-based "inferior" image is the notion that \nChristianity was founded on the New Testament, when in fact the early \nchurches had no Gospels but rather created and produced their \nown. 22 Not only did churchmen falsely pretend an apostolic origin for \ntheir scriptures; they also weeded out all references to female author- \nity or participation in Christian origins. 23 Only the forbidden Gnostic \nGospels retained hints that Jesus had 12 female disciples correspond- \ning to the 12 male disciples, or that Mary Magdalene was the leader of \nthem all. Even women\'s scholarship was denied. St. Jerome openly \nadmitted that his co-authors of the Vulgate were two learned women; \n\n\n\n100 \n\n\n\nbut later scholars erased the women\'s names and substituted the \nwords "venerable brothers." 24 \n\nl.Encyc.Brit, "Byblos." 2.

Latin aves meant both "birds" \nand "ancestral spirits," or ghosts, or angels. Roman emperors \nachieved godhood in the form of an eagle which was released above an \nemperor\'s funeral pyre to carry his soul to heaven. 1 Similarly, an \nEgyptian pharaoh\'s spirit rode aloft, on, or in, the solar hawk of Horus \nreleased at his funeral. Like Phoenix, he passed through the Fire and \nwas reborn with wings. Based on such prototypes, the souls of Christian \nsaints ascended to heaven in the form of white doves released at the \ncanonization ceremony. 2 \n\nBecoming a bird in a visionary or trance state was a widespread \nsymbol of initiatory death and rebirth. Shamans and prophets in the \nSouth Pacific, Indonesia, Central Asia, and Siberia claimed to transform \nthemselves into birds. Buddhist yogis said ecstatic flight was the first \nmagical power to be developed by the practice of yoga. "Becoming a \nbird oneself or being accompanied by a bird indicates the capacity, \nwhile still alive, to undertake the ecstatic journey to the sky and \nbeyond." 3 Celtic "fays" or "fairies" could change themselves into \nbirds, which is why they were depicted with wings like angels, and why \nwitches "flew" to the Sabbat. 4 \n\nThe Chinese said women knew the secret of flying before men \ndid. The emperor Shun first learned it from two princesses. "Down \nto a certain date the source of magical power lay in women ... an \nindication of an ancient Chinese matriarchy." In northern Europe \nalso, the Goddess Freya owned all the magic feather garments that \nenabled magicians to fly through the air like birds. 5 The elaborate \nfeather garments of Mayan and Aztec priesthoods probably had the \nsame original function, to facilitate their soul-flights. \n\nBecause birds traveled freely between the earthly and heavenly \nrealms, they were everywhere regarded as angelic messengers, givers \nof omens, possessors of occult secrets, as well as soul-carriers. Carrion \ncrows and vultures took souls to heaven. Storks brought them back to \nearth for rebirth. Wise owls told the secrets of the night; lustful doves \nand nightingales told the secrets of love. Angelic eagles foretold the \nfuture. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n\n\nBirds \n\n\n\nPhilo Judaeus (ca. 30 \nB.c-40 a.d.) Alexandrian \nJewish philosopher, \nstrongly influenced by \nHellenistic Platonism, \nPythagoreanism, and \nStoicism; author of \nbiblical commentaries, \ntracts, and histories. \n\n\n\nMyths repeatedly credit seers with power to understand the lan- \nguage of birds, usually because sacred serpents licked their ears to \n"open" them, as in the case of the Trojan prophetess Cassandra. 6 \nSiegfried likewise obtained the power to understand birds, via the \nmagic blood of the Great Serpent or dragon. A bird call, a magic \nformula, and singing were expressed by the same word in Germanic \nlanguages. 7 \n\nThe magpie was especially revered as an oracle. It was a picus \n(pecker) sacred to the Goddess Mag, or Magog, eponymous ances- \ntress of Scythian Magnetes, the Amazonian centaurs credited with \nprophetic powers. 8 In Rome, the magpie or woodpecker was a \ntotemic form of the god Mars, said to contain his soul between his \nincarnations as Maris or Faunus. \n\nIn Egypt the hawk represented the soul of Horus and of the \npharaoh who embodied him. Hawks came to stand for that portion of \nevery soul called the ba, which could come and go at will after death, \nflying freely in and out of the tomb. Narrow shafts were left open in pit \ngraves for the passage of the ba. Similar shafts in pyramids, sometimes \nmisconstrued as ventilation shafts, were originally intended to let the \nbird-soul of the deceased fly in and out. 9 \n\nThe bird-soul born out of the cremated body entered Egyptian \nmythology as the Phoenix, sometimes a man, sometimes a firebird. \nThe name was Greek, meaning "the Phoenician," a reference to \nsacrificed sacred kings of Astarte at Byblos, where they were frequent- \nly burned. 10 The cult moved to North Africa with Phoenician colonists, \nand was carried on at Carthage where sacred kings perished in flames \nto a very late date. 11 Their bird-souls, reborn from the flames and flying \nto heaven, gave rise to the myth of the Egyptian Phoenix who \nperiodically cremated himself and rose again from his ashes. His \nworshippers, identified with the god through his sacraments, partook \nof the same power of heavenly flight. A common expression for death \nwas "flying away." \n\nPhilo wrote of the sages\' soul-flights: "They accompany in thought \nthe Moon and Sun in their circuitings, the choirs of other planets and \nfixed stars, attached below to the ground by their bodies, but giving \nwings to their souls, so that, walking on the ether, they contemplate the \npowers they find there." Still known today as the yogic trance or out-of- \nbody experience, the soul-flight was often described in medieval \nbooks on Hermetic magic: "Nothing can obstruct, neither the Sun\'s fire \nnor the Ether nor the heaven\'s revolution nor the bodies of other \nstars; but, cutting across all space, the soul will ascend in its flight up to \nthe furthest heavenly body." 12 Bird lore has always clearly expressed \nman\'s envy of the power of flight and his longing to know what the \nworld looks like from high in the sky. \n\n1.

The system is still followed in some parts of the world. \nAmong the Hunza, pregnant or nursing women do not sleep with their \nhusbands. The Semai of Malaya think it correct to forbid sex during \nthe long nursing period, as this allows parents to space their children and \ngive adequate care to each one. 1 Even in an aggressive male- \ndominated society like the Yanomamo, men say they are afraid to have \nsexual intercourse with a nursing mother. \n\nSometimes modern people insult the animals by calling a human \nrapist an "animal." Animals don\'t rape. Sexual intercourse takes place \nonly when the female is receptive. When she is preoccupied with caring \nfor her young always her first priority the female shows no sexual \ninterest in the male. Should he be so ill-advised as to make sexual \ndisplays to her, she drives him away with bared teeth. \n\nThere is among animals no question of the use of force on the part \nof the male; the conjunction of the sexes is dependent upon the \nwillingness of the female. . . . And the female sexual instincts are subject \nto frequent and prolonged natural suspensions which do not always \ncorrespond with the operation of those instincts in the male. Among all \nherbivores the females, as soon as they are pregnant, retire from the \ncompany of the males to seek either complete seclusion and solitude, or to \ncollect in herds from which the males are excluded. Female elephants \ndrive away all males from the herds of cows and calves not only during the \nlong pregnancy of nearly two years, but throughout the period of \nlactation. The behavior is typical of animal females. Had the primitive \nhuman female admitted the male during menstruation, pregnancy, and \nlactation she would have departed from all biological precedents; her \nbehavior would have constituted an abnormality. 2 \n\nMany early records show that human females did not depart \nfrom biological precedent. Hippocrates and Galen supported the an- \ncient taboo on sex during pregnancy and lactation. There was a \ncurious remnant of the taboo even in a popular marriage manual of the \nearly 20th century, part of the vast body of sexual misinformation that \nour grandparents struggled with. The author declared that marital \nrelations during pregnancy would make the child epileptic. 3 \n\nIn most primitive societies it was unthinkable that male sexual \ndesires should take precedence over the needs of mothers and their \nchildren. 4 Patriarchy everywhere sought to change this, through reli- \ngious sanction. Women were to serve men\'s sexual urges even when \npreoccupied with motherhood. This was the meaning of God\'s an- \nnouncement to Eve: "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy \nconception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire \nshall be subject to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee" \n\n103 \n\n\n\nBirth Control (Genesis 3:16). In this context, "sorrow" meant labor pangs, as well as \n\nthe harried life of a mother with children too close together, and the \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m illnesses and injuries caused by spreading a mother\'s care too thin. \n\nThe Christian canon omitted the First Book of Adam and Eve, \nwhich contradicted the canonical scripture by stating that Eve stuck \nto the old system of birth control after all. She gave birth to Cain \nand his twin sister Luluwa, another incarnation of the lilu or "lily" \nwho was also Eve\'s predecessor Lilith. Then "when the days of \nnursing the children were ended" but not until then "Eve again \nconceived." She produced Abel and his twin sister. After Abel was \nkilled at the age of 15 years, Eve produced Seth to replace him. \n"After the birth of these, Eve ceased from childbearing." 5 Thus the \nentire human race descended from these four: Cain, Seth, and their \nsisters. According to this version of the story, Eve was not particu- \nlarly troubled by God\'s curse. \n\nHowever, later Judeo-Christian culture insisted on men\'s con- \ntrol of women\'s bodies. Wives were not to initiate sexual relations, but \nthey were never to deny their husbands. The Catholic church laid \ndown the law that no wife could accuse her husband of rape even if he \nforced her with accompanying brutality. Sexual "release" was his \nconjugal right (but not hers). \n\nThe church interpreted the fable of Genesis as God\'s mandate to \ncompel women to bear as many children as possible, even at the cost \nof the children\'s or the mothers\' physical health and welfare. 6 Men \nrefused to deal with the problem of over-production, and women \nwere forbidden to do so, by the church\'s tradition. In pagan times, \nwomen used some fairly effective birth-control devices, ranging from \nvaginal sponges to abortifacient drugs. Many churchmen believed the \nwitches inherited secret knowledge of such things, which contributed \nto the vigor of witch- and midwife-persecutions. \n\nFather Dominic Pruemmer recently wrote in American Freedom \nand Catholic Power: "Birth control is nothing else than mutual \nmasturbation or unnatural lust." 7 It is not usual to view the "lust" \nof marital partners for each other as unnatural. Nor did the church ever \nobject to sex as masturbation when it was for a husband\'s benefit \nonly that is, not mutually satisfying. In fact church-sanctioned litera- \nture of the 1 7th century said the only purpose of marital sex must be \nconception, and if a woman receives too much pleasure she cannot \nconceive. 8 \n\nThe church further taught women that their children belonged \nmore to God than to themselves, thus eroding the instinctive mater- \nnal possessiveness that fosters the best of child care. Not illogically, \nmothers often left their unwanted children for God to care for. In the \n1 8th century, the hospital of St. Vincent de Paul in Paris reported \nas many as 5000 infants annually deposited on God\'s doorstep. 9 Infant \ncorpses were rather commonly found among the rubbish of western \ncities. Foundling hospitals were so busy that they set revolving boxes in \n\n\n\n104 \n\n\n\ntheir walls, so infants could be passed through. Yet foundling hospi- Birth Control \n\ntals seldom saved the children they were given. In practice, they solved \n\nthe problem of excess births by killing babies by the thousands, under ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe sanction of male-dominated officialdom. 10 \n\nLondon\'s first foundling hospital admitted 1 5,000 infants in the \nfour years between 1756 and 1760. Of these, fewer than a third \nsurvived to adolescence. On the continent, the death rate for children in \nfoundling institutions ran between 80 and 90 percent during the first \nyear of life. Parish officers entrusted the care of newborns to women \nnicknamed "killing nurses," because they were expected to do the \nstate\'s dirty work, and see to it that the unwanted children did not long \nsurvive. 11 \n\nIn effect, the patriarchal society having outlawed birth control and \nabortion could find nothing better to do with the overflow than \ndestroy it after all. Apparently this was all right, as long as the decision to \ngive life or withhold it was not being made by the mothers them- \nselves. Vetter found this kind of morality puzzling: \n\nIs there any evidence that religion has provided a superior brand of \nwisdom for the guidance of secular affairs, or in the burning social \nissues of the day? With the population of the earth growing by geometric \nleaps from unchecked fertility but with epidemics and diseases well \nunder control, what religious leaders spoke up for the necessity of planned \nparenthood? Not one! But many did hound Margaret Sanger to prison \nfor her constructive work in that direction. IZ \n\nAn Englishwoman gave the following picture of conventional \nmorality in regard to reproduction, indicating that religious leaders care \nfor their own mythology and ceremonial well ahead of the future \nwelfare of the race: \n\nIn a village that I know well a woman, legally married, bore five idiot \nchildren one after the other; her husband was a confirmed drinker and \na mental degenerate. One of the children fortunately died. The text that \nwas chosen for his funeral card was "Of such is the kingdom of \nheaven. "About the same time in the same village a girl gave birth to an il- \nlegitimate child. She was a beautiful girl; the father, who did not live in \nthe village, was strong and young; probably the child would have been \nhealthy. But the girl was sent from her situation and, later, was driven \nfrom her home by her father. At the last she sought refuge in a disused \nquarry, and was there for two days without food. When we found her, \nher child had been born and was dead. Afterwards the girl went mad. n \n\nMargaret Sanger gave her life to the effort to prevent such \ntragedies, both within and without marriage. She believed that "excess \n\npeople, not acts of God, created poverty, famine, and war All \n\nsociety would gain . . . if birth control were allowed to shut off the spigot \nthat floods the world with weaklings. When sick and unfit mothers \nwere not forced to breed, there would be an end to unwanted children \nwho grow up to fill our prisons and asylums." 14 \n\nBut churches still doggedly opposed the right of women to \n\n\n\n105 \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male determine when, where, and how much they shall breed, largely \n\nbecause of the deep-seated male desire to control the life-giving miracle \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ m in which men play only a negligible part biologically. It can hardly be \ndenied that male-dominated religions were everywhere devoted to this \nend from their earliest inception. As a result, overpopulation threatens \nthe world with virtually unthinkable ecological and sociological dis- \nasters. 15 Even now, in the face of such disasters, religious leaders tend \nto the view that the faithful should multiply forever. \n\nl.Dentan,98. 2.

Brahmanas are \nprose commentaries on \nVedic scriptures, dated \nfrom 800 to 500 B.C. \n\n\n\nPadma Purana \n\n"Lotus Purana." Pura- \nnas are ancient \nSanskrit scriptures in \nverse, treating of cos- \nmologies, sacred \nhistories, and the na- \nture of the divine. \n\n\n\nRig Veda Foremost \nof the four Aryan scrip- \ntures written in Vedic \n(an older form of San- \nskrit), ca. 1500-1200 \nB.C., containing sacred \nmythology, hymns, \nand verses; literary \nfoundations of the \nVedic religion. \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male \n\nSince birth-giving was the only true mark of divinity in primitive \nbelief, the first gods to claim any sort of supremacy had to claim also the \nability to give birth. In fact, usurpation of the feminine power of \nbirth-giving seems to have been the distinguishing mark of the earliest \ngods. \n\nLacking vaginas, many gods gave birth from their mouths. Priests \nof Ra claimed their god gave birth to the first couple from his mouth. \nThe Satapatha Brahmana said the god Prajapati learned to give birth to \ncreatures from his mouth; but before he could manage it, he had to \nmake sacrifices to an older, higher power: the Goddess Svaha, Lady of \nSacrifices. According to the Padma Purana, a god named Sukra \n(Seed) was born from Shiva\'s penis, after living in Shiva\'s belly for a \nhundred years. However, this was not a proper maternal-type birth. \nSukra existed beforehand, and Shiva had to make himself pregnant by \nswallowing him. 1 \n\nThe Rig Veda spoke of a male creator who gave birth to the \nMother of Creation, then impregnated her, so she brought forth the \nrest of the universe. Brahmans tried to claim the Mother of All Gods \nwas born from Brahma\'s body, even though she was the mother of \nBrahma too. 2 Brahma was known as Lotus-Born, meaning he sprang \nfrom the primal Yoni, the Goddess Padma ("Lotus"). His first \nLotus Throne was located in her lap. The Rig Veda also called her Vac, \nthe Great Womb, the Queen, the First, the Greatest of All Deities. \nShe said: "I begot the All-Father on high. I dwell in the waters, the \ndeep, and thence extend through all creatures, and touch the heavens \nwith my crown. Like unto the wind I blow, encompassing all creatures; \nabove the heavens and above the earth." 3 \n\nHellenic Greeks pretended their new Father Zeus gave birth to the \nmuch older Goddess Athene from his head. But before he could \ngive birth to Athene, he had to swallow her real mother, Metis \n(Wisdom), who was pregnant with her at the time. 4 The Hellenes \nalso claimed Zeus gave birth to Dionysus from his thigh; but again, the \n\n\n\n106 \n\n\n\nreal mother was the Moon-goddess Selene, whom Zeus killed during Birth-Giving, Male \n\nher pregnancy. As Conductor of Souls, Hermes took the six-month \n\nfetus from Selene\'s womb and sewed him up in Zeus\'s thigh to \n\ncontinue his gestation. ^^^^^^^^ 11 \n\nA Greek carving showed the god Apollo sitting on a pile of eggs, \ntrying to copy the life-giving magic of his mother Leto, or Leda, or \nLatona, who gave birth to the World Egg and hatched it. 5 This World \nEgg was an old Oriental idea. The Satapatha Brahmana said it \ncontained "the continents, the oceans, the mountains, the planets and \nthe divisions of the universe, the gods, the demons, and humanity." 6 \nThus, birth laying the egg was the image of cosmic creation, and \ncreator-gods needed to copy it. In Egypt, the mother of the World \nEgg was Hathor in the guise of the Nile Goose, later mythologized as \nthe Goose who laid the Golden Egg. (See Goose.) \n\nAtum, the local god of Heliopolis, the biblical "City of On," \nclaimed to give birth to a primal couple from his penis by masturbat- \ning. Pyramid Texts of 2000 B.C. said "Atum created in Heliopolis by an \nact of masturbation. He took his phallus in his fist, to excite desire \nthereby. And the twins were born, Shu and Tefnut." 7 However, priests \nof Khepera insisted that their god produced Shu and Tefnut by \nmasturbation and self-fertilization through his mouth. Yet the oldest \ntraditions said Shu and Tefnut ("Dryness" and "Moisture") were \nborn of the primal Mother, Iusaset. Like the biblical God who copied \nher many centuries later, she not only created the first couple, but \nalso brought forth light as her first act of creation. 8 \n\nBefore begetting was understood, archaic myth-makers tried all \nsorts of ideas for making a male body produce offspring. A Chinese \nancestor-god, Kun, suffered a crude Caesarian section. He was slain and \ncut open so Yu, founder of the Hsia dynasty, could emerge from his \nstomach. 9 Norsemen said a first male-and-female couple were born \nfrom the sweaty armpit of the giant Ymir, who imitated Mother \nEarth in that his flesh became the soil, his blood the sea, his bones the \nmountains. 10 Ymir\'s skull became the dome of the heavens, support- \ned at four corners by four dwarves, Austri, Vestri, Nordri, and Sudri \n(East, West, North, and South), northern copies of the Sons of \nHorus. \' \' Similar cardinal-direction gods became identified with the four \nangels of the Apocalypse and four evangelists, whose totems were \nthe same. 12 Totem Symbol or \n\nThe god Loki gave birth to Odin\'s horse, after making himself embodiment of an \n\npregnant by eating a woman\'s heart. 15 The usual mythic symbol of a rationahSrif 31 \' ^ \n\nwoman\'s heart, from Egypt to northern Europe, was an apple. Thus it frequently in animal \n\nmight be assumed that in some prototypical versions of the Eden f orm; a divine or \n\nstory, Adam ate the apple before, not after, he gave birth to Eve. semi-divine mascot \n\nAdam\'s birth-giving was a syncretic product of numerous local supposed to have \n\nnotions of the male mother. A Hittite god, Kumarbi, managed to esce " e r man \n\n_ r , animal ancestor, \n\nbecome pregnant by eating his rival s penis. His offspring retused to \n\ncome out through his mouth or ears, and having no vagina he was \n\n\n\n107 \n\n\n\nBirth-Giving, Male unable to deliver them. Finally the sea god Ea took them out through \n\nhis side, as Adam\'s God did later. The idea for Adam\'s magic birth- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ giving rib came from a Sumerian childbirth-goddess, Nin-ti, "Lady of the \nRib." Since ti meant both "rib" and "life," she was also a Lady of \nLife. She made infants\' bones in utero from their mothers\' ribs, which is \nwhy biblical writers thought ribs possessed the magic of maternity. 14 \n\nAn odd male-birth myth came from Persia\'s intensely patriarchal \nZoroastrian cult, suggesting a combination of homosexuality and \nbestiality. The primal being, the Sole-Created Bull, was castrated and \nslain. Its semen went to the moon to be purified; then from this \npurified seed two new bulls were formed. From these, "all animals \ndescended." The hidden feminine element in this phallic fantasy was \nthe moon, of course; but the two bulls must have procreated homosex- \nually. This idea was not unknown even in Christian Europe. \n"Authorities" like Paracelsus taught that a monster may be born of a \nman as a result of oral or anal intercourse with another man. 15 No \nmatter how impossible it seemed, men apparently wished to preserve at \nany price the notion that a male could give birth. \n\nChristianity demoted the Goddess to mortal status in both Eve and \nMary, whom mystics regarded as two incarnations of the same \nperson. In both incarnations she was a Mother of her Father. Gnostic \nGospels said Adam came into being from the virgin Earth, who was \nnone other than Eve. 16 The story of her birth from Adam was a late, \ndistorted version of the myth. \n\nUnless the male spirit is able as in mathematics to construct a purely \nabstract world, it must make use of the nature symbols originating in \nthe unconscious. But this brings it into contradiction with the natural \ncharacter of the symbols, which it distorts and perverts. Unnatural \nsymbols and hostility to the nature symbol e.g. Eve taken out of \nAdam are characteristic of the patriarchal spirit. But even this attempt \nat revaluation usually fails, as an analysis of this symbolism might show, \nbecause the matriarchal character of the nature symbol asserts itself \nagain and again. \' 7 \n\nThroughout the world, men\'s initiatory dramas enacted birth- \ngiving to represent even the attainment of man\'s estate. Apparently men \ncould think of no better way to adopt new members into their \nfraternities than to make the novices symbolically dead and reborn, \noften from a male mother. In New Guinea, initiates into the men\'s \ngroup crawled out from between the legs of men costumed as the birth \nspirit. 18 Australian men opened their veins to bathe a young initiate \ninto their blood, magically imitating the blood of the womb. 19 \n\nBaptismal rebirth from male blood was an idea shared by all \nmystery cults of the early Christian era. In the Mithraic Mysteries, an \ninitiate was showered with the blood of the sacrificial bull and pro- \nnounced "reborn for eternity." 20 Afterward he was fed on milk, like \nan infant. 21 From primitive times to the present, men\'s groups devised \ntheatrical imitations of birth, often claiming the rites were stolen from \n\n\n\n108 \n\n\n\nwomen or that women were murdered for them and have sought to Bitch \n\nprotect these masquerades with all the taboos their priesthoods could \n\ninvent. 22 In Malekula, men even applied the name of mara to the place ^^^^__ ^_ \nwhere male initiations were held; it meant the women\'s obstetrical ^^^^^^ \n\nenclosure or birth-temple. 23 \n\nIn its determined exclusion of women, early Christianity evolved \nsome "birth rites" of a somewhat homosexual cast. Some writers \nclaimed Christian men could "impregnate" each other, in the spiritual \nsense, by kissing: "For it is by a kiss that the perfect conceive and give \nbirth." 24 But it was hard for men to see themselves as perfect, when \nthey conspicuously lacked the ability to bring forth and nurture new \nmembers of their race. Thus their endless quest for superiority nearly \nalways required some travesty of motherhood. \n\nSymbolic motherhood represented authority in the medieval \nRussian Orthodox wedding ceremony. The bridegroom threw the \nlap of his gown over his bride, signifying adoption by the ancient rite of \nmock birth. The wearer of the gown was "mother"; the one emerg- \ning from under it was "child." The Christian idea was to show that a \nhusband exercised over his wife the authority of a mother over her \nchild.

The Bitch-goddess of antiquity was \nknown in all Indo-European cultures, beginning with the Great Bitch \nSarama who led the Vedic dogs of death. The Old English word for \na hunting dog, bawd, also became a naughty word because it applied to \nthe divine Huntress\'s promiscuous priestesses as well as her dogs. 1 \n\nHarlots and "bitches" were identified in the ancient Roman cult of \nthe Goddess Lupa, the Wolf Bitch, whose priestesses the lupae gave \ntheir name to prostitutes in general. 2 Earthly representatives of the Wolf \nBitch ruled the Roman town of Ira Flavia in Spain, as a queen or \nseries of queens named Lupa. 3 \n\nIn Christian terms, "son of a bitch" was considered insulting not \nbecause it meant a dog, but because it meant a devil that is, a \nspiritual son of the pagan Goddess. \n\n1.

According to Tacitus, the Celts "deemed it \nindeed a duty to cover their altars with the blood of captives." 2 The \nRomans did the same in essence, though their altars were "blessed" with \nthe blood of sacrificial animals. \n\nCatholics now bless altars by sprinkling them with salt, an ancient \ncustom of the Jews, based on the primitive idea that blood and salt \nwere magical equivalents because they tasted alike. Egyptian altars were \ndedicated with salt. In Egypt, dedi was the magic salt that made Nile \nwater become "as human blood." 3 (See Menstrual Blood; Salt.) \n\nBlessing a person by drawing a cross on his head and breast \noriginated with the Mithraic rite of the Taurobolium, when the cross \n(an emblem of Mithra) was marked thus on participants with the bull\'s \nblood, so they became official witnesses of the ceremony of rebirth. \n\n\n\n110 \n\n\n\nTo be blessed meant to be saved, through the magic of blood, as the \nChristian Gospels also admitted: "Almost all things are by the law \npurged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission" \n(Hebrews 9:22). \n\nl.M.

Vishnu \nsaid the blood of his boar incarnation had the creative power that only \nthe Mother\'s blood formerly had: "Gods and creatures arise out of \nthe sacrifice, for the sacrifice is their appointed food. Everything will \nalways arise from the sacrifice; this whole universe is made of the \nsacrifice." Vishnu dared to copulate with the Earth Goddess while she \nwas menstruating, and begot three boar-sons who were also sacrificed \nby "gods saying Om," the Word of creation. 1 \n\nVishnu the Boar represented an early attempt to re-assign to a \nmale the holy creative blood of life, the Goddess\'s menstruum. As the \nphallic god who gave his life for humanity, he was worshipped in \nconjunction with the Goddess by Germanic Aryans who, Tacitus \nsaid, "worship the mother of the gods, and wear as a religious symbol \nthe device of a wild boar." 2 \n\nThis Germanic boar-god became the doomsday-averting Savior \nand Lord of Death, in both human and porcine form, "born in the \ndays of old . . . of the race of gods." He was identified with Heimdall, \nborn of the Earth-and-Sea mother, fathered by boar blood. "He was \nmade strong with the force of the earth, with the cold sea and the blood \nof the sacrificial boar." 3 That is, like most gods, in dying he begot \nhimself again. \n\nThe boar-god was sacrificed especially at Yul (Yule), with an apple \nin his mouth, symbolizing his regenerated heart-soul, according to \nthe Scandinavian belief that apples were resurrection charms. 4 Hence \nthe traditional Yule pig roasted with an apple in its mouth. There was \na mystical meaning behind the pork-eating ritual. "Valhalla\'s boar" was \ncooked in a cauldron, the regenerative womb-symbol, and the skalds \nsaid of it, "It\'s prime of pork, but few men know on what Valhalla\'s \nchampions feed." 5 If one may hazard a guess, Valhalla\'s champions \nused to feed on human flesh, for which the boar was substituted. \nSwedish priests in boar masks were regarded as incarnations of Frey, \nand husbands of Freya, indicating an identification with the sacrificial \ngod who once wedded the Mother and died as both a boar and a \nman. 6 \n\nThe Jews\' taboo on pig\'s flesh was nothing so hygienic or rational \nas fear of trichinosis, as some modern apologists have tried to suggest, \nshowing gross misunderstanding of the biblical mentality. Reinach said, \n"In the whole of the Bible there is not a single instance of an epi- \ndemic or a malady attributed to the eating of unclean meats. ... To the \nBiblical writers, as to contemporary savages, illness is supernatural; it \nis an effect of the wrath of spirits. The pious Jew abstains from pork \nbecause his remote ancestors, five or six thousand years before our \nera, had the wild boar as their totem." 7 \n\nLike their neighbors, the Jews worshipped sacrificial boar-gods: \n\n\n\n112 \n\n\n\nSyrian Adonis, for one. Boars were offered to Astarte in Syria, and to Bogey \n\nher counterpart Demeter in Greece. Demeter\'s Eleusinian Mysteries \n\nmythologized the boar sacrifice as "pigs falling into a crevice in the ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nearth" at the moment when Pluto, Lord of Death, seized his virgin \n\nbride Kore. 8 The custom of driving sacrificial pigs into pits, as in the \n\nrites of Demeter and Astarte, appeared in Christian Gospels as the \n\nmiracle-tale of the Gadarene swine, whose sacrificial death impelled \n\nby "demons" was re-assigned to the intervention of Jesus (Mark \n\n5:11-13). \n\nMyths of dying gods like Tammuz, Attis, and Adonis featured the \nboar, or boarskin-clad priest, who sacrificed the god in swine form. \nSuch gods were "gored in the groin" by the boar, an allegory of ritual \ncastration. 9 As lovers of the Goddess, they were chosen from mem- \nbers of her priesthood. The sacrificer of Adonis was another of the \nGoddess\'s lovers, Ares, wearer of the boarskin. The sacrificer and \ncastrater of Attis was his divine alter ego, a boar sent by Zeus, or by the \nking of Phrygia these presumed simultaneously incarnate in the \nsame body. 10 Like Christ, Attis was the dying Son later resurrected as \nthe Father who decreed his death in the first place. Similarly, Vishnu \nthe Boar decreed death for his boar-sons. 11 Some myths said Attis died \nin the same way as Adonis, being gored by a boar. Others said Attis \nhimself was the boar, a totemic sign of his kingship. 12 \n\nMalekula presents an original primitive view of the sacrificial \nanimal as savior or surrogate for men. Mother Death guards the gates \nof the after-world. A man must pass these gates by distracting her \nattention with his sacrificial pig. While she devours the pig, he slips \nby her. 13 After sacrificing and eating on earth the savior-pig who \nbecomes part of himself, the man says, "It is no longer I who live, but \nmy sacrifice who lives in me." H Christians similarly ate their god in \ncommunion, and were taught to recite at the gate of heaven, "No \n\nmore I, but Christ." \nThe old cults of the boar were not altogether forgotten. Medieval \nfairy tales abound in magic boars, often figuring as sacrificial animals. \nThe first French book printed on the subject of witchcraft, de Spina\'s \nFortress of the Faith, declared that French witches assembled at a \ncertain sacred rock to worship the devil in the shape of a boar. 15 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty, 196-97. 2.

Like other Manicheans, they held that \nthe God who created this world of matter was a demon. 1 \n\nThe Bogomils were highly puritanical but less sexist than the \nRoman church. They admitted women to religious offices on an \nequal basis with men. The Catholic writer Cosmas condemned as \n"deviltry" their custom of appointing women to hear confessions and \ngive absolution to men. 2 Up to the late 14th century, Bogomilism was \n"the most powerful sectarian movement in the history of the Bal- \nkans," but Catholic crusades drove many members of the sect into the \narms of Islam, and the movement was crushed.

Spinka, p. 66. \n\n\n\nBones \n\nMany religions tabooed breaking the bones of a sacrificial animal, on \nthe theory that the gods needed a complete skeleton to resurrect it \nanew. 1 On one occasion, the god Thor killed and resurrected two \ngoats, but the thighbone of one had been damaged, so the new goat was \nlame. 2 \n\nThe same belief is evident in the Bible. Concerning the paschal \nlamb, God ordered: "Neither shall ye break a bone thereof" (Exodus \n12:46); "They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break \nany bone of it" (Numbers 9:12); "He keepeth all his bones; not one of \nthem is broken" (Psalms 34:20). To fulfill all these alleged prophe- \ncies, Jesus\'s bones were left intact to identify him with the Lamb: "That \n\n\n\n114 \n\n\n\nthe scripture should be fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken" \n(John 19:36). \n\nSeveral saints\' legends also made use of regenerative bones. \nSt. Germain resurrected a calf, on whose flesh he had just feasted, by \nlaying the bones on the hide and praying over them. 3 A derivative\' \nmedieval belief was that every body contains an incorruptible seed-bone, \n"out of which, as they say, as a plant out of the seed, our animal \nbodies shall in the resurrection of the dead spring up." 4 \n\nl.Lnrvusse, 307. 2. Silberer, 82. 3. de Voragine, 398. 4. Agrippa, 88. \n\n\n\nBrahma \n\n\n\nBrahma \n\nIndia\'s patriarchal god, whose priests tried to establish wholly male- \ndominated society and eliminate the Mother Goddess who, \nnevertheless, remained the parent of Brahma as she was of the other \ngods. Though some of Brahma\'s scriptures tried to dissociate him from \nthe Mother by calling him "the Birthless," yet the same scriptures \nincongruously referred to him as the Goddess\'s "Firstborn." 1 \n\nThe older dharma (holy law) said the worst of crimes was killing a \nwoman or female child, because it meant killing unborn generations. 2 \nHowever, like most patriarchal systems, Brahmanism lifted the taboo on \nmale aggression against females, and claimed that it was better to kill \nwomen than to insult Brahmans: "To revile and calumniate a worship- \nper of the Supreme Brahman is a sin ten million times worse than \nthat of killing a woman." 3 \n\nLike the medieval Christian church, Brahman priests made rules \nfor rigid control of wives, and made their deity say any other kind of \nmarriage was a sin that made the wife a whore and the children \nillegitimate, disqualified for religious observances. 4 \n\nBrahman marriage reversed the old system of matrilineal inheri- \ntance, insisting that property must pass from father to son. A widow \nwithout male children was entitled to inherit only if she "lives under the \ncontrol of the relations of her husband, and in their absence under \nthe control of her father\'s relations" that is, male relations "then \nonly is she entitled to inherit. The woman who is even likely to go \nastray is not entitled to inherit the husband\'s property." 5 In practice of \ncourse, any or all of these male groups could easily declare the widow \nunfit to inherit and divide the property among themselves. \n\nBrahmanism was essentially paternal ancestor-worship, possibly the \nroot of similar paternal ancestor-worship instituted in Israel by the \nlegendary Abraham, whose name meant "Father Brahm." There was \nthe same obsession with record-keeping. At every Brahman wedding, \nlong lists of paternal ancestors were recited, like the biblical lists of \n"begats." Brahman sons were taught to recite: "My father is my \nhighest Dharma My father is my Heaven. On my father being \n\n\n\n115 \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\n\n\nsatisfied, the whole Universe is satisfied." Brahma also displayed the \npatriarchal god\'s usual insistence on exclusivity: "Those who are averse \nto My doctrine are unbelievers and sinners, as great as those who slay \na Brahman." 6 \n\nIt is clear that Jewish patriarchy owed a debt to Brahman prece- \ndent. From the Far East came the legend of the Golden Age of \nrighteousness, when men were free from sin, had great longevity, and \ngrew to gigantic size. 7 Comparable were the long-lived biblical \npatriarchs of the antediluvian age when there were "giants in the earth" \n(Genesis 6:4). The story of Cain and Abel was Indo-Iranian. Vedic \npoets used to beg their god to accept their sacrifices, and reject those of \nother arya (men). 8 \n\nThe legend of Jonah was prefigured by the Indian tale of Candra- \ngomin, who endangered the ship he sailed on because a rival \nmagician caused a storm and took the form of a sea beast to swallow \nhim. 9 \n\nTalmudic tradition adopted the typical Oriental belief in transmi- \ngration of souls; Adam\'s soul passed by transmigration into David, \nthan into the Messiah. 10 Brahmanic revelation seemed to be part of the \nMessianic promise also. The Katha Upanishad said Brahma is realized \nin one\'s own soul dimly, as if seen in a mirror; but in the heaven of \nBrahma he is realized clearly, "as one distinguishes light from \ndarkness." 11 The New Testament repeats the same message copied al- \nmost word for word: "For now we see through a glass (i.e., mirror) \ndarkly, but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). The Brahman \ndoctrine that a thousand years is one Day of Brahma is repeated in \nPsalms 90:4, and again in the First Book of Adam and Eve, where God \nexplains that "five days and a half for him means 5,500 years for \nmen. 12 \n\nBrahma is no longer popular in his native land. He is described as a \n"theologian\'s god, whose worship never struck vital roots in the \npopular folk soil." He was used mainly to support the caste system. \n"Today Brahma is so relatively unimportant that only one or two \ntemples in all India are reserved for his exclusive worship." 13 \n\n1.

However, some \nscholars believe the \nGlossary was compiled \nlater than his \nlifetime. \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\nTriple Goddess of the great Celtic empire of Brigantia, which \nincluded parts of Spain, France, and the British Isles. Before she was a \nsaint, she was a typical feminine trinity. Brigit ruled; her two sisters \ngoverned the arts of healing and smithcraft. Cormac\'s Glossary called \n\nher "Brigit the female sage Brigit the goddess, whom poets \n\nadored, because her protecting care over them was very great and very \nfamous." 1 \n\n\n\n116 \n\n\n\nDr. MacCulloch said Brigit "originated in a period when the Celts \nworshipped goddesses rather than gods, and when knowledge \nleechcraft, agriculture, inspiration were [sic] women\'s rather than \nmen\'s. She had a female priesthood and men were perhaps excluded \nfrom her cult, as the tabooed shrine at Kildare suggests." 2 Brigit\'s \npriestesses at Kildare kept an ever-burning sacred fire like that of the \ntemple of Vesta in Rome. They called the three personae of Brigit the \n"Three Blessed Ladies of Britain" or the "Three Mothers," and \nalways identified them with the moon. 3 \n\nThe number of Brigit\'s priestesses at Kildare was 19, representing \nthe 19-year cycle of the Celtic "Great Year." Greeks said the sun god \nof the north, whom they called Hyperborean Apollo, visited the north- \nern "temple of the moon goddess" once every 19 years, a mythic \nexpression of the coincidence of solar and lunar calendars. 4 In reality the \nperiod of coincidence was 18.61 years, which meant the smallest \nregular unit to give a"mating" of sun and moon was 56 years, two \ncycles of 19 and one of 18. This astronomical data was well known to \nthe builders of Stonehenge, who marked the span of Great Years with \nposts around their circle. 5 \n\nBrigit was older than Celtic Ireland, having come with Gaelic \nCelts from their original home in Galatia. One of her earliest shrines \nwas Brigeto in Illyricum. 6 Long before the Christian era, the Goddess \nof the Brigantes was said to be the same as Juno Regina, Queen of \nHeaven, and Tanit, the Dea Celestis (Heavenly Goddess). 7 \n\nFinding the cult of Brigit impossible to eradicate, the Catholic \nchurch rather unwisely canonized her as a saint, calling her Bridget \nor Bride. Hagiographers declared she was a nun who founded a convent \nat Kildare. But the convent was noted for its heathenish miracles and \nevidences of fertility magic. Cows never went dry; flowers and sham- \nrocks sprang up in Brigit\'s footprints; eternal spring reigned in her \nbower. Irish writers refused to reduce their Goddess to mere sainthood, \nand insisted that she was Queen of Heaven, which meant identifying \nher with Mary. She was called "Mother of my Sovereign, Mary of the \nGoidels, Queen of the South, Prophetess of Christ, Mother of \nJesus." 8 \n\nAn Irish charm against the evil eye suggested collusion between \nthe pagan and Christian heavenly-mother figures; it was "the Spell \nthe great white Mary sent to Bride the lovely fair." 9 She was also the \nmystic mother-bride of St. Patrick, supposed to have died as one of \nher sacrificial victims, and entered the underworld via her sacred grove \nat Deny Down. An old distich said, "On the hill of Down, buried in \none tomb, were Bridget and Patricius." 10 Since Patrick\'s name meant \n"father," and he was as apocryphal as other Irish saints, he may have \nbeen a new name for Brigit\'s old consort the Dagda or "father." \n\nThree churches of "St. Brigit" occupied her Triple-Goddess \nterritory of Hy Many, formerly Emania or Emain Macha, country of \nthe Moon. Baptismal fees of those churches belonged to the O\'Kelly \ntribes, descended from the Goddess\'s kelles or sacred harlots. Her \n\n\n\nBrigit, Saint \n\n\n\nJ. A.

St. Brigit\'s feast day was the first of \n\nFebruary, the first day of spring according to the pagan calendar. It \nwas called Oimelc, Imolg, or Imbulc, the day of union between God \nand Goddess. 11 \n\nThe same day was celebrated in Rome as the Lupercalia, sacred to \nVenus and to women generally. With unconscious irony, the church \ntransformed it into the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, also called \nCandlemas, which kept much of its pagan symbolism and was \nregarded as a major festival of witches. 12 \n\nLike other versions of the Celtic Goddess, Brigit was a teacher of \nthe martial arts, and a patron of warfare or briga. Her soldiers were \nbrigands, or as Christians called them, outlaws. 15 Robin Hood\'s merry \nmen were outlaws of the same kind; so were Kali\'s Thugs and the \n"Assassins" who worshipped the Arabian Moon-goddess. \n\nBrigit was canonized more than once. Besides the Irish Brigit there \nwas a St. Bridget of Sweden, foundress and supreme ruler of a double \nmonastery of both sexes, the Order of Brigantines. (See Convent.) A \nbranch of the ancient "colleges" of Brigit was a Brigantine House of \nSion established in 1420 on the bank of the Thames, where it flourished \nuntil 1589 as a center of education for ladies of noble birth. 14 \n\nI.

Burning sulfur was used \neven in medieval times to fumigate sickrooms and avert the plague. The \nuse of brimstone as an agent of purification accounts for its appear- \nance in the cauldron of Purgatory with its "fire and brimstone" to burn \naway sins. \n\nAlchemists tried to "marry Hermes and Athene" by combining \nmercury with brimstone, which they thought might create gold. \nThey never succeeded. \n\n1.

The \ntitles by which she was addressed in prayers and hymns were later mis- \nunderstood as the names of different deities, which is why the \nGoddess became "goddesses" in the west, or the Thousand-Named \nOne in the east. \n\n1 .

Graves, W.G., 39. \n\n\n\nBroomstick \n\nBroomsticks were long associated with witches because they figured \nin pagan rituals of marriage and birth, the Mysteries of Women. In \nRome the broom was a symbol of Hecate\'s priestess-midwife, who \n\n119 \n\n\n\nBroomstick swept the threshold of a house after each birth to remove evil spirits that \n\nmight harm the child. 1 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ As Hecate was also the Triple Goddess presiding over marriage, \n\nher broomstick signified sexual union. Old wedding customs included \njumping over a broomstick, possibly to represent impregnation. Gypsy \nweddings always included the same ritual, though gypsies now say they \ndon\'t know what it means. 2 Oddly enough, the same broom-jumping \nritual marked the churchless weddings of black slaves in nineteenth- \ncentury America. \n\nMedieval peasant weddings in Europe were also churchless, as a \nrule, coming under the jurisdiction of common law rather than canon \nlaw, and using the rites of the old religions rather than the new. The \nbroom was so closely identified with non-ecclesiastical marriages that \nby Renaissance times, when the church began to take over the nuptial \nrites, unions "by the broom" were declared illegitimate. English \nrustics still say "if a girl strides over a broom-handle, she will be a mother \nbefore she is a wife." A girl who gives birth to a bastard child is said to \nhave "jumped over the besom." ? \n\nAs a horse for witches to ride, the broomstick apparently signified \nTantric-type sexual unions which were primary attractions of the \nfemale-oriented witch cults. Plants genet, the broom plant, was sacred \nto witches. This may explain why the ruling family of Anjou in the \n12th century was named Plantagenet. Henry II, first Plantagenet king of \nEngland, inherited his throne by matrilineal succession through his \nmother Matilda, or Maud names commonly associated with witch- \ncraft the countess of Anjou. Genet also meant a horse or steed, the \n"royal horse" of paganism. This meaning is preserved in the word \njennet, a small horse or the female donkey, and in the names fre- \nquently taken by witches: Jenet, Janet, Jeannette, Jean, or Joan. \n\nSuch names suggested a witch-child born of a sacred marriage with \na phallic god represented by the broom. A Janet or Jenny was a \nDaughter of the Horse, and old gods like Volos, Volsi, Waelsi, or Odin \nwere called "Horse\'s Penis." 4 Riding the broomstick seems to have \ndenoted the kind of sexual position viewed as a perversion by the \nchurch, woman above, man below acting as her "horse." This sexual \nimplication is confirmed by the old witch-rhyme, "Ride a cock-horse to \nBanbury Cross (i.e., crossroads), to see a fine lady on a white horse." \nThe fine lady was Godiva, "the Goddess." Her white cock-horse \nsignifed her consort. 5 \n\nChildren rode the cock-horse as a broomstick with a horse\'s head, \ncopied from Sufi mystics who entered Spain in the early Middle \nAges. Besides their organization in groups of thirteen, like covens, and \ntheir worship of the Rabba or "Lord," later transformed into the \nwitches\' god Robin, Sufi sages rode horse-headed canes called zamal- \nzain, "gala limping horse." The dervish\'s stick-horse stood for the \nPegasus-like fairy steed that carried him to heaven and back. 6 Such \ncustoms became prevalent among the Basques, who were frequently \naccused en masse of witchcraft. \n\n120 \n\n\n\nAt times a witch\'s broomstick seems to have been nothing more \nthan a dildo, anointed with the famous "flying ointment" and used \nlor genital stimulation. 7 French witches "flew" this way: "With an \nlintment which the Devil had delivered to them they anointed a \nIvooden rod which was but small, and their palms and their whole hands \nlikewise; and so, putting this small rod between their legs, straightway \nIhey flew there where they wished to be . . . and the Devil guided \nIhem." 8 Certainly churchmen were prone to describe any kind \nIf masturbation as guided by the devil women\'s masturbation most \nlarticularly so, for nothing was more abhorrent to the patriarchal \nInind than the thought that women could experience sexual pleasure \nwathout men. \n\nWitches\' ointments often incorporated such drugs as aconite, \nleadily absorbable in an oil-based liniment through skin or mucus \nInembrane, producing symptoms like giddiness, confusion, lethargy, \nlingling sensations followed by numbness, and quite possibly the \nIllusion of flying. Thus Oldham wrote: \n\nSo witches some enchanted wand bestride, \nAnd think they through the airy regions ride. 9 \n\nBecause of their ancient association with pagan midwives and \njheir Christian counterparts the witches, broomsticks took on an accre- \nion of similar superstitions. Witches\' familiar spirits were said to be \ninable to cross running water; hence, it became "bad luck" to move a \nroom across running water. It was also "bad luck" to burn a broom, \nince it was certainly bad luck for the witch. 10 \n\n1. Dumezil, 616. 2. Trigg, 86-87. 3. Spence, 148. 4. Turville-Petre, 201. \n5. Hazlitt, 25. 6.

English "brother" stemmed from Sanskrit \nhratr, "support." In pre-Vedic India it was the duty of a brother, not a \nusband, to help support a woman and her children. Husbands came \nnd went, but the matrilineal clan remained stable. As an old proverb of \nirab women said: "A husband can be found, a son can be born, but a \nrother cannot be replaced." \' \n\nA preference for brothers over husbands may be found in many \nre-patriarchal cultures. Pagan Slavic women considered "by my \nrother" their most binding oath. In pre-Christian Norway, rune stones \nn women\'s graves were raised by their brothers, not their husbands. 2 \nindent systems of clan loyalty were similar to that of the Nairs, of \nhorn it was said that no man knew his father, but "every man looks \nn his sister\'s children as his heirs. A man\'s mother manages his \n\n\n\nBrother \n\n\n\n121 \n\n\n\nBuana \n\n\n\nfamily; and after her death his eldest sister assumes the direction." \nNames and property were bequeathed in the female line. 3 \n\nThe uterine-sibling bond was so much stronger than the marriage \nbond in ancient societies that the ultimate endearment of lovers or \nspouses was to call each other "brother" and "sister." 4 King Solomon \ncalled his bride "my sister, my spouse" (Song of Solomon 4:10) with \n"sister" in the place of honor. An Egyptian wife affectionately addresse \nher husband as "brother, husband, friend," in that order. 5 \n\nWeddings sometimes meant making bride and groom pseudo- \nsiblings in some magical way. Polynesian couples were not \nconsidered truly married until their two mothers mingled their blood, \nsignifying that the married pair were born of a double, or merged, \nwomb. 6 Often, the bride and groom mingled their own blood; this was \nthe common rite of gypsy weddings. 7 \n\nBrother-sister incest was customary in ancient ruling families, \nwhen it was felt that a king and queen should be offspring of the same \nmother, so the true line of succession would not be weakened. Egyptiai \npharaohs married their sisters as a matter of course because their \nthrones were inherited through the female line. 8 One pharaoh with onl \none son and one daughter suggested to his wife that the children \nmight marry outside the family. The queen angrily rejected the idea: \n"Dost thou wrangle with me? Even if I have no children after those \ntwo children, is it not the law to marry them one to the other?" 9 \n\nBrother-sister incest was everywhere the practice of the elder gods \nand goddesses, many of whom were twins who copulated even in \ntheir mother\'s womb. Examples are Isis and Osiris, Artemis and Apollo \nFauna and Faunus, Diana and Dianus, Zeus and Hera, Yama and \nYami, Freya and Frey. According to Norse skalds, brother-sister incest \nwas the accepted custom of the Vanir or elder deities. 10 \n\nMythological evidence tends to destroy the modern conception oi \nStone Age man protecting "his" cave with "his" mate and "their" \nchildren. If the home was a cave or anything else, it was probably \nselected, furnished, and owned by the female. If there was a male \nprotecting it, he was more likely to have been a sibling than a mate. In \nfact there were no monogamous families but only family groups, \ncentering on the women and children with impregnating males a loose \nchangeable periphery. \n\n1. Briffault 1, 405, 498, 505. 2.

The Amogha school of Buddhism practiced a severe \nmorality, a life of poverty and chastity in retirement from secular \nconcerns, and the expectation of a Savior coming to earth in the near \nfuture. 1 Buddhist sages provided prototypes of Christian miracles. \nThey were said to walk on water, to speak in tongues, and to ascend to \nheaven in the flesh. 2 Jains regarded the true Buddhist "hero" (vira) as \n"not he who is of great physical strength and prowess, the great eater \nand drinker, or man of powerful sexual energy, but he who has \ncontrolled his senses, is a truth-seeker, ever engaged in worship, and \nwho has sacrificed lust and all other passions." 3 \n\nBuddha is more properly the Buddha, since Buddha was not a \nname but a title, the "Enlightened or Blessed One," comparable to \nChristos, "the Anointed One." Buddha had many other names because \nhe had already lived through many incarnations on earth. Even the \nBuddha supposed to have appeared in the 5 th century B.C. had several \nnames: Gautama, Sakyamuni, Siddhartha the last, again, not a \nname but a title, "Rich in Yogic Power." Buddha was miraculously \nbegotten by the Lord of Hosts and born of the Virgin Maya, the \nsame Great Goddess worshipped throughout Asia and having the \nalternative Near-Eastern names of Maia, Marah, Mari, or Maria. 4 \n\nMany Buddhas who had already come and gone were bodhisattvas \nor saints, sometimes simply known as Buddhas. Any sage might \nbecome a bodhisattva through devotion to the holy life. But one true \nBuddha remained to come again to earth. He was Maitreya, the \nMaster, or the Future Buddha, similar to the being known as Kalki, the \nlast avatar of the god Vishnu who would appear with the approach of \ndoomsday. The final coming of the Savior would signal the end of the \npresent world. He would judge the righteous, and annihilate the \nwicked, and make everything ready for the ultimate creation of a new \nheaven and a new earth. 5 \n\nThese were basic ideas of Christianity as well as Buddhism: simple, \neasy to understand, dramatic, and appropriately aligned with arche- \ntypal hopes and fears. The more subtle teachings of Buddhism, like \nthose of Christianity, apparently developed out of group thinking of \nsubsequent sectaries, especially the more ascetic sort. Yet again, as in \nChristianity the ascetics were unable to blot out the rich, colorful \nsensuality of "pagan" Hinduism. Although they claimed Buddha said \nthe true sage must never see or speak to a woman, must avoid \nfeminine creatures like the plague, yet within a few centuries the \nworship of the Goddess reasserted itself and all the bodhisattvas were \nprovided with Shaktis who would welcome them to eternal sexual bliss \n\n123 \n\n\n\nBuddhism in heaven. "Tantric" Buddhism re-assimilated the feminine principle. \n\nUntil the advent of Islam, the original Buddhist asceticism was largely \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ forgotten except for a few eremitic groups. A well-known aphorism \nsaid: Buddhatvam yosidyonisamsritam, "Buddhahood resides in the \nvulva (yoni)." 6 \n\nBuddhist legends reveal the constant tension between ascetic and \nsensual elements. It was said Buddha wanted his brother Nanda to \nbecome a monk, but Nanda was too much in love with his beautiful \nmistress. So Buddha played a trick on him. He took Nanda to heaven \nand showed him the celestial nymphs, who were so desirable that Nanda \ninstantly forgot the mortal woman he had loved. Buddha then told \nhim these nymphs could be won only by a life of rigorous self-denial \nand meditation. Nanda agreed to join the monkish order. The ascetic \nlife soon purged him of all desires, and he became as celibate as Buddha \nhad wished but only because of his overwhelming lust for a tran- \nscendent sexual experience! 7 \n\nLike their western counterparts in later centuries, Buddhist monks \nself-consciously threatened the Goddess with destruction, even \nthough her virgin form had given birth to their Savior. A Buddhist \nhymn said, "This time I shall devour thee utterly, Mother Kali; for I \nwas born under an evil star and one so born becomes, they say, the \neater of his mother." 8 \n\nStories of the Buddha and his many incarnations circulated inces- \nsantly throughout the ancient world, especially since Buddhist monks \ntraveled to Egypt, Greece, and Asia Minor four centuries before Christ, \nto spread their doctrines. 9 Ascetics like the Essenes were certainly \ninfluenced by them. Christians continued to hear tales of Buddhist \norigin, and to relate them rather naively to their own beliefs. Buddha \nhimself entered the Christian canon as a saint St. Josaphat, a corrup- \ntion of Bodhisat when John of Damascus wrote down his life story \nin the 8th century a.d. 10 Buddha the Christian saint was supplied with \na companion called Barlaam, who converted the Indian prince to a \nChristian asceticism despite his royal father\'s efforts to thwart this \npurpose. 11 \n\nMany scholars have pointed out that the basic tenets of Christian- \nity were basic tenets of Buddhism first; but it is also true that the \nceremonies and trappings of both religions were more similar than \neither has wanted to acknowledge. \n\nBuddhism has much in common with Roman Catholic Christianity, \nhaving its purgatory, its Goddess of Mercy, and its elaborate machinery \nfor delivering the dead from pain and misery through the good offices of \nthe priests. Among other similarities may be mentioned celibacy, \nfasting, use of candles and flowers on the altar, incense, holy water, \nrosaries, priestly garments, worship of relics, canonization of saints, use \nof a dead language for the liturgy and ceremonials generally. The trinity of \nBuddhas, past, present, and future, is compared by some to the Father, \nSon, and Holy Ghost. The immaculate mother of Shakyamuni, whose \nname Maya is strikingly similar to that of Mary, the mother of Jesus, is \n\n124 \n\n\n\nBugger \n\n\n\nalso to be noticed, while Buddha\'s temptation on Vulture Peak by Mara \n\nthe Evil One, may also be contrasted with the similar temptation of \n\nOur Lord. . . . The worship of ancestors is in some measure akin to the \n\nsaying of masses for the dead, and at one time the Jesuits considered it a ^^^^^^"" \n\nharmless observance and tolerated it in their converts.

Bulgarian Paulicians were \nanathematized for disobeying the Roman pope, setting up their own \nchurches independent of Rome, and admitting women to clerical \noffice on an equal basis with men. 1 \n\nBosnian Patarenes were also called buggers, since they modeled \ntheir national church on that of Bulgaria. About 1200 a.d. the papacy \nlaunched "a cruel war against the Bosnian Patarenes, which lasted two \nand a half centuries, and finally culminated in the acceptance, on \ntheir part, of the Mohammedan faith and in becoming Turks, rather \nthan submit to the Roman See." 2 \n\nReligious wars led the Balkans into social chaos. Heretics were \nhunted down like animals, and tortured. Lands belonging to the \nheretic magnates (nobles) were seized and handed over to their Catholic \nenemies. The heretics for their part continued to regard themselves \nas the only true Christian nations. Under the anti-Roman Code of \nStephen, Catholic priests who tried to convert Balkan Christians back \nto "the Latin faith" were declared criminals. 3 Quarrels and conflicts \npersisted up to the present century. \n\n1. Knight, D.W.P., 176. 2. Spinka, 147. 3. Spinka, 167-68. \n\n\n\nBull \n\nThe biblical title translated "God" is El, originally the title of the \nPhoenician bull-god called Father of Men. As the "supreme god of the \nSemitic pantheon, El was worshipped throughout Syria alongside the \nlocal gods, or Ba\'als, one of his titles, indeed, being \'the Bull.\' " \' Like \nZeus the Bull, consort of Hera-Europa-Io the white Moon-Cow, El \nmarried Asherah, the Semitic sacred Cow. He was identified with Elias \nor Helios, the sun. He was still the Semitic Father of Men in the time \nof Jesus, who cried to him from the cross, calling him Father (Mark \n15:34). \n\nNearly every god of the ancient world was incarnate sooner or later \nin a bull. The Cretan moon-king called Minos inhabited a succession of \nMinotaurs (moon-bulls), who were sacrificed as the king\'s surrogates. \n\n\n\n125 \n\n\n\nBull Yama, the Hindu Lord of Death, wore a bull\'s head and became the \n\nunderworld judge, like Minos. 2 Shiva was incarnate in the white bull \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Nandi. 3 The real reason King Nebuchadnezzar "ate grass" probably \nwas that his soul temporarily entered into the body of the divine \nsacrificial bull (Daniel 4:33). Court prophets of the kings of Israel put \non bull masks to represent the king while casting spells for his victory \nover his enemies (1 Kings 22:1 1). 4 \n\nBull worship was a large part of Mithraism. The bull\'s blood was \ncredited with power to produce all creatures on earth without the aid of \nthe cow, though her power was implicit in that the bull\'s blood was \ntaken up and magically treated by the Moon. The bull was consecrated \nto Anahita, a Persian name of the Moon-goddess whom the Greeks \ncalled Artemis Tauropolos, "Bull-Slayer," of whom the bull-slaying \nsavior Mithra was a late, masculinized form. 5 Like most patriarchal \nsymbols, those of the Mithraic cult were copied from myths of the \nAsian Goddess. A statue of Kali in the Ellora caves shows her in the \npose typical of Mithra, holding up the nose of the sacrificial bull and \npreparing to slaughter it. 6 \n\nThe bull was killed for a baptism of blood at the Roman Taurobo- \nlium in honor of Attis, Cybele, or Mithra. "A trench was dug over \nwhich was erected a platform of planks with perforations and gaps. \nUpon the platform the sacrificial bull was slaughtered, whose blood \ndripped through upon the initiate in the trench ... he turned round and \nheld up his neck that the blood might trickle upon his lips, ears, eyes, \nand nostrils; he moistened his tongue with the blood, which he \nthan drank as a sacramental act. Greeted by the spectators, he came \nforth from this bloody baptism believing that he was purified from his \nsins and \'born again for eternity.\' " 7 The participant in the Taurobo- \nlium acted out literally what Christians called washing in the blood of \nthe lamb. \n\nEgypt\'s savior Osiris was worshipped in bull form as Apis-Osiris, \nthe Moon-bull of Egypt, annually slain in atonement for the sins of the \nrealm. 8 In the ceremony of his rebirth, he appeared as the Golden Calf, \nHorus, born of Isis whose image was a golden cow. The same Golden \nCalf was adored by the Israelites under Aaron (Exodus 32:4). \n\nThe Orphic god Dionysus also took the form of a bull; one of his \nearlier incarnations was the Cretan bull-god Zagreus, "the Goodly \nBull," a son and reincarnation of Zeus, and another version of the \nMinotaur. The god was a bull on earth, and a serpent in his subterra- \nnean, regenerating phase. The Orphic formula ran: "The bull is the \nfather of the serpent, and the serpent is the father of the bull." 9 \nDionysus was reincarnated over and over, and there were some who \nidentified him with the Persian Messiah. In the Book of Enoch, \nthe Messiah is represented as a white bull. 10 \n\nAthenian legends of the Moerae or Fates compared all men to \nthe sacrificial bull sentenced to death at the hands of Fate sooner or \nlater. Medieval superstition called the Fate-goddess Mora, a nocturnal \nspirit who roams the world seizing men and crushing them until they \n\n126 \n\n\n\n"roar like bulls." She was also Christianized as St. Maura, on whose Buto \n\nsacred day women were forbidden to sew, lest they "cut the thread of Byelobog \n\nlife" after the manner of the Moerae. 11 ^^^^-^_^^_^ \n\nIn medieval England, Twelfth Night games featured remnants of \nbull worship. A large cake with a hole in the center was thrown over the \nbull\'s horn, to form a lingam-yoni. The bull was then tickled, "to make \nhim toss his head." If he threw the cake behind him, it belonged to the \nmistress; if in front, it belonged to the bailiff. 12 This ceremony probably \nderived from an ancient custom of divination. Like all sacrificial victims \nalready dedicated to the supernatural realm, the bull was believed to \nhave prophetic powers. \n\n1. Larousse, 74. 2. Campbell, ML, 409. 3. Campbell, Or.M, 90. \n4.

Italian \nnobleman, philosopher \nand scholar, declared \na heretic for his \nattempts to unite \nChristian theology with \nCabalistic doctrine. \n\n\n\nCabala \n\nMedieval Jewish mystical system obviously influenced by Tantrism \nand Sufism, like the Christian courtly-love movement of the same \nperiod. The Cabala\'s basic premise was that all the world\'s ills \nstemmed from God\'s loss of contact with his female counterpart, the \nShekina, a Hebraic version of Shakti. God is fragmented, and only \nthe Shekina has power to "put God back together." \' Universal harmo- \nny must be restored by making God and his Goddess once more \n"one." 2 \n\nSexual union of mortals was thought to create its like on the plane \nof the divine. Therefore sexual intercourse was a sacramental act \nhelpful to God and the Shekina. "The efflorescence of such beliefs into \norgiastic rites suggests itself too readily not to be attempted, and in- \ndeed, in the further development of Kabbalistic doctrine, such attempts \nwere made." 5 Generally, however, the cabalist confined his erotic \nexperiments to his legal wife. The first step in his ascent of the \nSephiroth or Tree of Knowledge was the female sexual power, \nShekina-Malkuth, Queen and Bride, represented by the moon and the \nspouse. 4 Further steps made use of elaborate systems of numerology, \nmagic, and scriptural allegory, yielding successive revelations of the \ndivine nature. \n\nThe major cabalistic work was the Sefer ha-Zohar, "Book of \nSplendor," composed in the late 1 3th century by Moses de Leon of \nGuadalajara, who claimed its real author was the legendary 2nd-century \nmystic Simeon ben Yohai. He pretended to have the ancient original \nof the book in his possession, but it was never produced. Scholars have \nconcluded that it never existed, and de Leon wrote the Sefer ha- \nZohar himself. 5 \n\nDespite its Jewish orientation, the Cabala exerted a strong appeal \nfor contemporary Christian mystics. It has been much in the favor of \noccultists ever since. Pico della Mirandola even professed to find in the \nCabala what the Jews themselves denied: the incarnation of full \ngodhood in Jesus. He wrote: "No science offers greater assurance of \nChrist\'s divinity than magic and the Cabala." 6 See Hexagram; \nShekina. \n\nl.Lederer, 186. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Cabala." 3. Lederer, 188. 4.

Her consort was the Young God, variously known as \nDionysus, Ganymede, or Cabirius. In Thebes the Great Goddess \n\n\n\n130 \n\n\n\nwas called Demeter Cabiria, sometimes a trinity of "three Cabirian Caduceus \n\nnymphs." Her sexual union with the god was represented by the Caillech \n\nsame symbol as in India and Egypt: water poured from a male vessel ^^^^^^^^^-i \n\ninto a female one. 1 (See Jar-bearer.) Because of its ancient erotic \nconnotations, Cabiria became a common witch-name in medieval \ntimes. \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 324-25. \n\n\n\nCaduceus \n\nSome Gnostic Christians worshipped the serpent hung on a cross, \nrod, or Tree of Life, calling it Christ the Savior, also a title of Hermes \nthe Wise Serpent represented by his own holy caduceus, the scepter \nof two serpents. This was one of the oldest and most revered holy \nsymbols. "The usual mythological association of the serpent is not, as \nin the Bible, with corruption, but with physical and spiritual health, as in \nthe Greek caduceus." To Sumerians it was an emblem of life, \nappearing on art works like the Libation Cup of Gudea, ca. 2000 b.c. In \npre-Hellenic Greece the caduceus was displayed on healing temples \nlike those of Asclepius, Hygeia, and Panacea, which is why it is still an \ninternational symbol of the medical profession. The caduceus is \nfound also in Aztec sacred art, enthroned like a serpent-deity on an \naltar. North American Indians knew it too. A Navaho medicine man \nsaid his people\'s sacred cave once featured "a stone carving of two \nsnakes intertwined, the heads facing east and west." \' \n\nHindu symbolism equated the caduceus with the central spirit of \nthe human body, the spinal column, with two mystic serpents twined \naround it like the genetic double helix: ida-nadiio the left, pingala-nadi \nto the right. 2 \n\nMoses\'s brazen serpent on a pole, the mere sight of which cured \nthe Israelites, was probably a prophylactic caduceus (Numbers 21:9). \nIt was named Nehushtan, and worshipped in the tabernacle up to the \nreign of Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4). See Hermes. \n\n1. Campbell, M. I., 282-84, 286-88, 294-95. 2. Bardo Thodol, 215. \n\n\n\nCaillech \n\nOld Celtic name for Kali-the-Crone, the Great Goddess in her \nDestroyer aspect. Like Kali, the Caillech was a black Mother who \nfounded many races of people and outlived many husbands. She was \nalso a creatress. She made the world, building mountain ranges of stones \nthat dropped from her apron. 1 \n\nScotland was once called Caledonia: the land given by Kali, or \n\n\n\n131 \n\n\n\nCain Cale, or the Caillech. "Scotland" came from Scotia, the same \n\nGoddess, known to Romans as a "dark Aphrodite"; to Celts as Scatha or \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m Scyth; and to Scandinavians as Skadi. 2 \n\nLike the Hindus\' destroying Kalika, the Caillech was known as a \nspirit of disease. One manifestation of her was a famous idol of carved \nand painted wood, kept by an old family in County Cork, and described \nas the Goddess of Smallpox. As diseased persons in India sacrificed to \nthe appropriate incarnation of the Kalika, so in Ireland those afflicted by \nsmallpox sacrificed sheep to this image. 3 It can hardly be doubted that \nKalika and Caillech were the same word. \n\nAccording to various interpretations, caillech meant either an old \nwoman, or a hag, or a nun, or a \'Veiled one." 4 This last apparently \nreferred to the Goddess\'s most mysterious manifestation as the future, \nFate, and Death ever veiled from the sight of men, since no man \ncould know the manner of his own death. \n\nIn medieval legend the Caillech became the Black Queen who \nruled a western paradise in the Indies, where men were used in \nAmazonian fashion for breeding purposes only, then slain. Spaniards \ncalled her Califia, whose territory was rich in gold, silver, and gems. \nSpanish explorers later gave her name to their newly discovered paradise \non the Pacific shore of North America, which is how the state of \nCalifornia came to be named after Kali. \n\nIn the present century, Irish and Scottish descendants of the Celtic \n"creatress" still use the word caillech as a synonym for "old \nwoman." 5 \n\nl.Rees,41. 2.

The Bible says Cain\'s murder \nof his brother Abel was caused by jealousy, after God accepted Abel\'s \nblood sacrifice but rejected Cain\'s offering of vegetable firstfruits. \nFearing to depart from this precedent, the Jews offered blood \nsacrifices to Yahweh up to the early Christian era. \n\nThe Bible story was a Hebraic repetition of the Persian myth of \nAhriman and Ahura Mazda, who offered sacrifices to an elder deity, \nVayu. Ahriman was declared a traitor and devil when his offering was \nrefused. 1 Indo-Iranian priests used to pray the gods to accept their \nown sacrifices, and refuse those of other arya (men). 2 Ahriman was the \nancestor of those other arya, since his original Hindu name was \nAryaman, father of men. \n\nThe myth of Cain was based on primitive sacrificial magic, as \nshown by certain internal inconsistencies. God placed a curse on \n\n\n\n132 \n\n\n\nCain, at the same time protecting him with a mark of immunity. Hooke \nexplains part of the ritual fertility sacrifice: \n\nThe sacrificer is defiled by his act. ...It is this which explains why the \nslayer enjoys ritual protection . . . the most likely explanation of the \nmark is that it represents a tattoo mark or other indication that the fugitive \nbelonged to a sacred class. We have evidence from Hebrew sources \nthat the prophets bore such marks. . . . Tammuz, who bears the title of \n"the Shepherd, " dies, or is ritually slain, during the period of summer \ndrought . . . and his official slayer was obliged to flee in order to remove \nthe ceremonial guilt of the slaying from the community. 3 \n\nSuch comparisons are needed to solve the dilemma of those \ntheologians who, through the centuries, have been helpless to explain \nGod\'s apparent blunder in protecting Cain from nonexistent ene- \nmies, when there were as yet no people in the world but Cain and his \nparents. Actually, the sacred caste of Cainite smiths worshipped the \nGoddess and dedicated sacrifices of the Good Shepherd to her as the \nEarth, who "opened her mouth" for Abel\'s blood (Genesis 4:1 1). \nCain\'s myth reflects the patriarchs\' hostility toward this caste. 4 Eventual- \nly, they drove all the smiths out of their country, and had to send their \ntools to the Philistines for repair because "there was no smith found \nthroughout all the land of Israel" (1 Samuel 13:19). Before the ban \non smithcraft, however, they had the famous Tubal-cain, "instructor of \nevery artificer in brass and iron" (Genesis 4:22). The fraternity of \nsmiths was of Midianite origin, and may have inflicted a certain leg \ninjury upon initiates, which could have been the mark of Cain. The \nHebrew word for Passover, Pesach, meant "to dance with a limp." 5 \nThe festival of Pesach was associated with the Midianites or Kenites \n(Cainites, "children of Cain"), who were famed as miners and smiths, \nand worshipped the Great Mother in the copper mines of Sinai. \n\nAccording to the Sinai tablets, Semitic metalworkers called their \ndeity Elath-Yahu, a combination of Yahweh and El-Lat or Allatu, Lady \nof the Underworld; but she was also identified with celestial Hathor. 6 \nThe Cainites migrated from northern Syria, where their smith god \nformerly occupied the volcanic mountain Jebel-Al-Aqra, a seat of Baal \nin the Ras Shamra texts. 7 The Mosaic Yahweh was a volcano-god \nlike this Midianite Baal, or like limping Hephaestus and Latin Vulcanus, \ngods represented by "a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by \nnight" (Exodus 13:21-22). \n\nExodus 2:16 says Moses was adopted by the Midianite smiths \nthrough his marriage to their priestess, one of the usual sacred \nnumber of seven sisters. Prominent in the clan were such artisans as \nBezaleel, maker of the ark of the covenant, who was filled "with the \nspirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all \nmanner of workmanship; and to devise curious works, to work in \ngold, and in silver, and in brass" (Exodus 35:31-32). The word here \n\n\n\nCain \n\n\n\n133 \n\n\n\nCallisto translated "God"apparently meant the spirit of Elath-Yahu. But \n\nCandlemas Moses quarreled with his Midianite wife, apparently over his attempt to \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ institute the Egyptian custom of circumcision (Exodus 4:25) and \nthey were divorced (Exodus 18:2). Subsequently, smithcraft dis- \nappeared from Israel after a long-remembered feud that imputed the \ncrime of fratricide to Moses\'s followers, though their priestly tradition \nwas to lay it on Cain. The account in Exodus 32 shows that the \nvictims were not shepherds, but Cainites: \n\nMoses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord\'s side? \nlet him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves \ntogether unto him. And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of \nIsrael, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate \nto gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every \nman his companion, and every man his neighbor. And the children of \nLevi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that \nday about three thousand men. (Exodus 32:26-28) \n\nIn later ages, Cain became a demi-devil, in the view of religious \n\nauthorities who failed to notice that the true brother-slayers were Moses\'s \n\nfollowers. Or, if they did notice, they regarded the killing of three \n\nthousand as less important than the killing of one. In folklore, Cain \n\nremained attached to the diabolized matriarchal tradition: he was the \n\nman in the moon. 8 A German tale said the man in the moon refused to \n\nkeep God\'s sabbath, the Sun-day. Therefore he was sent to the moon, \n\nand a saint informed him: "As you value not Sunday on earth, yours \n\nshall be a perpetual Moon-day in heaven." 9 \n\nl.Larousx, 323. 2. Dume/il.425. 3.

Calliste was an old name for Artemis\'s sacred \nisland Thera (She-Beast). Hellenic writers said the Attic rites of \nArtemis involved young girls dressed as the She-bear, which gave rise to \nthe myth of Callisto, a nymph who lost her virginity to Zeus and gave \nbirth to the bear-child. They were placed in heaven as Ursa Major and \nUrsa Minor. 1 Of course the nymph was the virgin aspect of the \nGoddess herself. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1, 86; W.G, 185. \n\nCandlemas \n\nBecause it fell forty days after Christmas, Candlemas became the \nFestival of the Purification of the Virgin according to the Judeo- \nChristian rule that women must be "purified" forty days after \n\n\n\n134 \n\n\n\nchildbirth, an event which the patriarchs claimed rendered a mother Cannibalism \n\nritually unclean. The Bible specifies forty days of impurity following \n\nthe birth of a son, and eighty days following the birth of a daughter, ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsince females were supposed to be twice as unclean as males \n\n(Leviticus 12:2-5). The Christian God also considered new mothers \n\nunclean, and would not allow a woman to enter a church until the \n\nproper time had elapsed after her delivery. Her ritual purification was \n\nknown as "churching." \n\nThe Council of Trullus once tried to abolish the festival of \nCandlemas, on the ground that in giving birth to Christ, the Virgin \n"suffered no pollution, and therefore needed no purification." \n\nBut Candlemas was not originally a Christian festival. To Roman \npagans, it was the day honoring Juno Februata as the virgin mother \nof Mars. Like the Lupercalia two weeks later, the day commemorated \nthe Goddess who engendered the "fever" (febris) of love. 1 Christian \nauthorities said the pagan people went about Rome with "candles \nburning in worship of this woman Februa." Pope Sergius renamed \nthe holy day "to undo this foul use and custom, and turn it onto God\'s \nworship and our Lady\'s ... so that now this feast is solemnly hal- \nlowed through all Christendom." 2 Still, Candlemas was properly \nconsidered sacred to women and to the Goddess of Love. 5 Among \nCeltic pagans it was the Feast of Imbolg, which stood opposite the great \nfestival of Lammas in the old sacred year. \n\nOmens were taken on Candlemas Day for the new growing \nseason, especially its weather. Therefore animals were said to come \nout of hibernation to provide helpful predictions for the end of winter; \nwhich is why it is now Groundhog Day. An old rhyme said, "If \nCandlemas Day be fair and bright, Winter will have another flight; If \nCandlemas Day be shower and rain, Winter is gone and will not \ncome again." 4 \n\nl.deVoragine, 151. 2.

Hazlitt, 87. \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\nThe most consistently observed taboo in civilized society is the taboo \nagainst eating human flesh, though there is no comparable taboo against \nkilling, which is done regularly, sometimes in enormous volume, as in \nthe case of war. \n\nUpon finding human sacrifice but not cannibalism among the \nPolynesians, Captain Cook called it a shocking waste of the human \nrace, and wrote: "It were much to be wished, that this deluded people \nmay learn to entertain the same horror of murdering their fellow- \ncreatures ... as they now have of feeding, corporeally, on human flesh \nthemselves." 1 Of course the good captain failed to notice that the \nsame delusion dwelt among his own countrymen. Eventually the \n\n\n\n135 \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\n\n\nMethodius 9th-cen- \ntury Greek missionary \nto the Slavs, canon- \nized soon after his death \nby the Greek church, \nand a thousand years \nlater by the Roman. \n\n\n\nChristians taught the Polynesians not to murder their fellow-creatures \nany more, by the simple expedient of murdering large numbers of \nPolynesians until they gave up. \n\nWestern morality has always allowed and encouraged mass killing, \nprovided the dead never became meals for the living. It has been \nnoted that the decline of human sacrifice and cannibalism in antiquity \nwas not accompanied by a decline in human slaughter generally. On \nthe contrary, the scale of warfare steadily increased with the growth of \ncivilization, up to the point where the highly technical civilizations of \ntoday stand ready to exterminate an entire world. Moreover the highest \ncasualty lists have been accumulated in precisely the same nations \nthat call themselves Christian. 2 \n\nChurches, declaring themselves officially opposed to killing, have \nalways managed to justify it nonetheless, when it seemed expedient. \nEven more curious a contradiction may be found on the matter of \ncannibalism, which Christian authorities regarded with the utmost \nhorror. Witches were accused of this crime more than any other, since it \nseemed dreadful enough to deserve the merciless punishment its \nalleged practitioners received. Yet at the very core of Christian faith lay \nthe sacrament upon which salvation, redemption, eternal life and all \nthe rest depended completely: a sacrament of cannibalism, not "sym- \nbolic" but according to its theological rationale, absolutely real. \n\nGod-eating was a universal custom descended from the earliest \nbeginnings of civilization, when it was usually a genuine cannibal \nfeast. As the incarnate god, "the victim is not only slain, but the \nworshippers partake of the body and blood of the victim, so that his \nlife passes into their life, and knits them to the deity in living \ncommunion." 3 \n\nThe object was to become flesh of the god\'s flesh by eating him, so \nas to share in the resurrection of the divine flesh. There is no use \npretending that this "Christian" ceremony did not originate in ceremo- \nnies of real cannibalism as primitive sympathetic magic. All the \nmystery-religions of the early Christian era centered on a pseudo- \ncannibalistic sacrament believed to identify the worshipper with the \nworshipped. "That there was a firm belief in the earlier stages of \nreligion, of such participation in the god by eating him in a sacramen- \ntal meal cannot be questioned. In the Thracian-Dionysiac Mysteries, \ne.g., the celebrants by such a meal obtain a share in the divine life of \nthe god, and so are called by his name." 4 \n\nThe same idea underlay Christian sacraments as well as those of \nthe other Mysteries. Cyril of Jerusalem talked of "partaking of the \nbody and blood of Christ, that you may become con-corporate and con- \nsanguineous with Him; for thus we become Christophori, his body \nand his blood entering into our members." Methodius taught that \n"every believer must through participation in Christ be born a \nChrist. ... He was made man that we might be made God." The same \nsacrament in other religions, however, was a diabolic rite: "Evil spirits \n\n\n\n136 \n\n\n\ngain power by means of the food consecrated to them, and are \nintroduced by your own hands into your own bodies; there they hide \nthemselves for a long time and unite with the soul." 5 \n\nTrue cannibalism was still overtly associated with Tibetan sacrifices \nup to the 7th century a.d., after which the sacred mystery play \nprovided symbolic substitutes. A victim made of dough was torn apart, \nhis "entrails" distributed and devoured. Sometimes, real flesh from \nthe corpse of an executed criminal was inserted into the dough image. \nAt the atonement festival, a bull-masked priest called the Holy King \nof Religion stabbed the sacrificial figure, cut off its limbs, opened the \nbreast and extracted artificial lungs, heart, and intestines. The re- \nmains were scattered by animal-masked dancers, as the remains of Osiris \nand other savior-gods of antiquity were scattered over the earth. 6 \n\nSuch dancers recall the Sabeans (Shebans) of Ezekiel 24, called \n"women that shed blood," who dressed in golden crowns and brace- \nlets to make mourning for the dead, and "ate the bread of men." Similar \nfunerary dancers were the Egyptian muu or "mothers," who wore \nvulture feathers to impersonate the Goddess Mut, or Nekhbet, eater of \nthe dead. \n\nRecently in parts of France it was a custom to make a dough man \nof the last sheaves of the harvest to represent the human sacrifice. He \nwas broken in pieces by the make (an old title of a clan mother) and \ngiven to the people to eat. Similarly in Mexico, after human sacrifices \nwere discontinued, a flint-tipped dart was hurled into the breast of a \ndough man. This was known as "killing the god so that his body \nmight be eaten." In a ceremony called torqualo, "God is eaten," the \nimage was divided into small pieces and distributed among the \npeople. 7 \n\nThis was an obvious survival of Aztec religious ideas. The victim \nimpersonating the god received worship, healed the sick, and blessed \nthe people, always attended by his keeper-apostles. Then he was killed \nand butchered in special houses called calpulli, which distributed him. \nNursing mothers would smear their nipples with a victim\'s holy blood so \neven their infants could partake of it. \n\nThe Greek omophagia was originally a cannibal orgy that even \ndispensed with cooking. Victims were torn apart with the teeth and \nbare hands of the participants and eaten raw. Greek classical writers \npreferred to forget the omophagia. They looked down on barbarian \ntribes for sexual promiscuity and cannibalizing their family members. 10 \n\nWhat was the relationship between eating sacred kings and saviors \nand eating family members? The answers have been given by canni- \nbals themselves: women eat the flesh of dead men and bring them back \nto life as new children. Primitive people reasoned that, in order to be \nborn again, one must get inside a woman\'s body. The simplest way to \naccomplish this was to be eaten by her. This was the original root of \nthe world-wide doctrine of reincarnation: literally, re-clothing in flesh. \n\nBefore discovery of the mechanism of conception, a dying man \n\n\n\nCannibalism \n\n\n\nThe original "barbe- \ncue" was a cannibal \nfeast. The word \ncame from barbricot, \nthe grill of green \nboughs on which Carib \nIndians used to roast \nhuman flesh. 8 \nAncient writings often \nspeak of the canni- \nbalistic habits of elder \nraces. The Norse el- \nder gods or giants were \njotunn, from an \nIndo-European root \nword meaning "eat- \ners." They were \nbelieved to eat men, \nlike jack\'s giant who \ndrank the blood of \nEnglishmen and made \nbread of their bones. 9 \n\n\n\nH7 \n\n\n\nCannibalism looked forward to rebirth from one of the tribal mothers who would \n\nconvert his flesh and blood into a new baby. Thus the Massagetae \n_____ __________ considered being eaten by clan mothers the only honorable death. A \n\nman could become flesh of their flesh, and live again. 11 Resurrection \nwas brought about by the mysterious magic of women who, like the \nearth, gave life over and over. \n\nAustralian native women have been known to eat their infants who \ndie, then to paint the bones red and hang them about their bodies: \ncrude magic aimed at returning the child to the matrix and re-coating its \nbones with life-giving maternal blood. Women of the Bibinga tribe \nstated quite plainly that they ate the dead to give them reincarnation. 12 \nIn New Guinea, a newborn child would receive the soul-name of a \nman who was killed and his flesh given to the mother to eat. 13 \n\nIn 1852, Dr. Hubsch wrote of the African tribe called Niam- \nNiam: "As soon as one of the tribe dies, his relations, instead of \nburying him, cut him up and regale themselves upon his remains; \nconsequently there are no cemeteries in this land." H Baganda \ntribesmen said their women sometimes became so hungry that they bit \noff their babies\' ears probably a euphemistic way of saying they ate \nthe whole baby, confident of their ability to give it another birth. 15 \n\nThe notion that pregnancy is the result of eating is still widespread \namong savages. Words for consuming and conceiving are often the \nsame. There was an ancient Babylonian proverb: "Who grows pregnant \nwithout having conceived? Who grows fat without having eaten?" 16 \nAccording to Horace, the real primal scene was not the sexual drama \npostulated by Freud, but "A child, by a fell witch devoured, dragged \nfrom her entrails, and to life restored." 17 The Bible\'s term for birth is \n"coming forth from the bowels" (Genesis 1 5:4), for, like children, the \nancients were not altogether certain of the distinction between repro- \nductive and digestive systems. The Sanhedrin said a woman may \nconceive by drinking or bathing in water used to wash a corpse, an \nobvious survival of the primitive idea of a dead soul entering a new \nmother. 18 \n\nThe Chinese in the Shang period thought birth and rebirth were \nthe same thing. The pictogram kuei, meaning both "soul" and \n"rebirth," was a fetus. 19 \n\nThe Yanomamo say they used to practice cannibalism, because \ntheir mother goddess Mamokoriyoma allowed them to eat dead \nparents and children. But they ceased to worship her, and declared \ncannibalism a sin. Cremation of the dead was instituted. Yet they still \neat the ashes of the dead, mixed with food. Sharing the ashes of \nimportant ancestors is a sacred ceremony thought to strengthen \nkinship bonds. 20 \n\nIn southeastern Africa, when a woman marries into another \nkinship group, she must eat kernels of grain raised on the skull of a \ndead ancestor. When she gives birth, elders watch for signs of similarity \nbetween the deceased and the new baby. Kernels of grain were \nsimilarly grown on the mummy of Osiris and the body of Adonis, who \n\n138 \n\n\n\nwas born in Bethlehem, the "House of Bread." The grain was eaten \nin solemn communion by the god\'s worshippers, who took it to mean \nthey were like him, and would be reborn like him. Hawaiians had a \ngod like Osiris, who was dismembered and buried in many earth- \nwombs. Foodstuffs grew from the parts of his body. 21 \n\nNearly all religions incorporate hidden hints of cannibalism. Apart \nfrom the sacrament of god-devouring that Christianity shared with \npaganism, the primitive church was accused of real cannibalism. Ro- \nmans claimed the Christians sacrificed and ate children, and dipped \ntheir host in children\'s blood. Orthodox authorities didn\'t deny these \ncharges, but insisted only the Gnostic sects were to blame. Justin \nMartyr said the Marcionites practiced incest and cannibalism. Eusebius \nof Caesarea said the Carpocratians did it. Epiphanius said the \nMontanists and Ophites did it. Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, and \nthe 5th-century Presbyter Salvian all blamed heretic Christians for \nholding anthropophagus rites that brought disgrace on the church. 22 \n\nDespite powerful taboos, cannibalism was not unknown in medi- \neval Europe. In periods of famine or plague, when many starved to \ndeath in the streets of European towns, bodies sometimes simply \ndisappeared. In 1435 the Sawney Beane family of Galloway was \naccused of having lived on a diet of human flesh for generations; but \nthey were tortured to death by the court at Edinburgh, which may \nrender their confessions suspect. 23 In 1661, four Scottish "witches" \nwere tortured into confessing that they ate an unbaptized child dug up \nfrom the Forfar churchyard. 24 This seems improbable, since the \nunbaptized were not buried in churchyards.

See Furies; Kingship. \n\n\n\nCaste \n\n\n\nCaste \n\nInventors of the caste system were Indo-European patrilineal tribes \nwhose early migrations destroyed many centers of Neolithic matriarchy; \nyet they had to attribute their social hierarchy to the authority of \nMother Earth, the Goddess of final authority. Their eastern offshoots, \ncalling themselves Aryans, conquered northwestern India and \nbrought a Dark Age to a formerly flourishing civilization, about the \nmiddle of the 2nd millenium B.C. Like the priests of western Europe \nin a later Dark Age, the Aryan priests devised the caste system to \nrelegate native peoples to a lower status, and to preserve this order \nwith a claim of divine ordinance. \n\nThis doctrine taught that all those born into low rank were living \nout a necessary punishment for sin in a previous existence, even \nthough they may not remember it. Their duty was to accept their lot \nwithout complaint, work hard, and obey their superiors, so as to win a \npromotion in the next life. It was perhaps the most effective method of \npreserving a hierarchy that human ingenuity has ever produced. 1 \n\nUnder the rule of the warlike Aryan Aesir, who conquered \nScandinavia\'s earlier matriarchal tribes, "the castes and professions \nare regarded as reflections in the human sphere of the laws of the \nnatural order." 2 The father of Teutonic castes was Rig-Heimdall, \n"King of the Sea-Home." Their mother was the Triple Goddess Earth \nin all three of her forms. \n\nRig-Heimdall lay with Edda the Great-Grandmother, oldest of \nGoddesses, and begot a son named Thrall, "Slave." Then he lay with \nAmma, the Grandmother, and begot a son named Karl, "Freeman." \nThey he lay with Modir, the Mother, and begot a son named Jarl, \n"Earl, prince." These three were ancestors of the castes. \n\nThe same Rig-Heimdall was named Ram, the phallus. He was \nsacrificed as a Horned God. Like Scyld, Arthur, and other pagan \nheroes he was born of the ninth wave of the sea. His Magic Song said \nhe was born of nine maidens, daughters of the Elder Race, another \nmultiplication of the same Triple Goddess, everywhere the Mother- \nBride. The Nine made him strong with the sea\'s cold strength and \nwith sacrificial blood. 3 \n\nRig-Heimdall resembled the Vedic fire god Agni, Son of the \nWaters, who returned to the waters at his death. Some say Agni is \nperiodically reincarnated in the Dalai Lama, another "Son of the Sea." \nThe Rig Veda said of Agni, "He with clear flames unfed with wood, \nshines in the waters." 4 This was not marine luminescence, but an \nallegory of the ancient idea that blood was sea water infused with fire, \nthe element of living heat (see Elements). As the god in dying fertilized \nMother Earth with blood, so fire dying in water turned the cold brine \n\n\n\n141 \n\n\n\nCastration into warm red blood of life. This was the primitive theory behind the \n\n"mating of fire and water" in both Norse and Vedic myth. \n\nhp^ B^BH Apart from the castes in both eastern and western Aryan societies \n\nwere the outcastes: India\'s Untouchables, or pariahs. Their duties \nwere "carrying water and chopping firewood." Their virtue consisted of \naccepting these chores and attending to them faithfully. 5 It is no coincid- \nence, but a tradition of genuine Indo-European origin, that the Bible \nspeaks of outcasts who could not be touched, but were allowed to live \nas "hewers of wood and drawers of water" (Joshua 9:21). Yahweh\'s \nscribes pretended the idea came from their ancestors, but obviously \nit was borrowed from Far-Eastern concepts of the caste system. \n\n1. de Camp, A.E., 294. 2.

Campbell, Or.M., 459. \n\n\n\nCastration \n\nAll mythologies suggest that, before men understood their reproduc- \ntive role, they tried to "make women" of themselves in the hope of \nachieving womanlike fertility. Methods included couvade or imitation \nchildbirth; mock death and rebirth through artificial male mothers; \nceremonial use of red substances to imitate menstrual blood; and \ntransvestism. Another method was ceremonial castration. Its primitive \nobject was to turn a male body into a female one, replacing dangling \ngenitals with a bleeding hole. (See Birth-giving, Male.) \n\nMany gods became pseudo-mothers by this means. Egypt\'s solar \ngod Ra castrated himself to bring forth a race called the Ammiu out \nof his blood. 1 The phallus of the Hindu "Great God," Mahadeva, was \nremoved and chopped to pieces by priestesses of the Goddess. The \npieces entered the earth and gave birth to a new race of men, the \nLingajas (Men of the lingam, or phallus). 2 In a Chukchi variant, the \nGreat God Raven acquired feminine secrets of magic for men by \npounding his own penis to a pudding and feeding it to the Goddess \nMiti (Mother). 3 In Mexico, the savior Quetzalcoatl made new humans \nto repopulate the earth after the Flood by cutting his penis and giving \nblood to the Lady of the Serpent Skirt the Goddess with many shorn \nphalli dangling about her waist, a figure also known in the Middle \nEast, e.g. as Anath. 4 \n\nSeveral forms of the Heavenly Father became creators by a rite of \ncastration. The god Bel cut his "head" (of the penis) and mixed his \nblood with clay to make men and animals, copying the magic of Mother \nNinhursag. 5 Shamin, the Phoenicians\' Father Heaven, was castrated \nby his son El and made the world\'s rivers from his blood, imitating the \nGoddess\'s menstrual magic. Arabs called this god Shams-on, the sun. \nThe Bible called him Samson, whose blindness and hair-cutting were \nboth mythic metaphors of castration. \n\nShearing the sun god\'s "hair" (rays) meant emasculating him. His \nsevered penis represented the son/supplanter; and a penis was often \ncalled "the little blind one," or "the one-eyed god." Greeks\' personifica- \n\n\n\n142 \n\n\n\ntion of the phallus, Priapus, was the son of Aphrodite and her \ncastrated consort Adonis. Their Roman counterparts Vesta and Vulcan \nproduced a phallic god Caeculus, "the little blind one." 6 \n\nUranus, "Father Heaven," was castrated by his son Cronus. \nUranus\'s severed genitals entered the sea-womb and fertilized it to \nproduce a new incarnation of the Virgin Aphrodite Urania, "Celestial \nAphrodite." It was she who ruled the earlier cults of castrated gods, \nsuch as Anchises and Adonis. She was the same as the Canaanites\' Lady \nof the Serpent Skirt: her priests castrated gods in her honor. \n\nSo did the priests of Aphrodite\'s Nordic counterpart, Freya-Skadi. \nThe Nordic Father Heaven was Odin, whose twelfth holy name was \nJalkr, "Eunuch." 7 As a castrated god, Odin was the son-phallus of an \nolder Eunuch personifying both father and son; for Odin was also the \nOne-Eyed God, or Volsi, a "stallion penis." 8 (See Horse.) Like the \nstallion of the Vedic horse sacrifice, he was castrated. A late myth tried \nto account for Odin\'s crude phallic title by saying he could not drink \nof the cosmic feminine fountain of wisdom until he had given up one of \nhis eyes. 9 Here one might recall the alternating seasonal castrations \nof Set and Horus in Egypt, their severed phalli mythologically described \n\n\n\nCastration \n\n\n\nas "eyes.\' 10 \n\n\n\nBiblical writers called the penis a "sinew that shrank," lying "upon \nthe hollow of the thigh." This was the sinew that Jacob lost in his \nduel with "a man who was a god." Jacob, "the Supplanter," was \nanother name for Seth, or Set, who was likewise symbolized by the \nLadder of Souls and likewise engaged in a contest with his rival, ending \nin his castration. 11 When Set was castrated, his blood was spread over \nthe fields in the annual ceremony of sowing so as to fertilize the crops. 12 \n\nThe Book of Genesis confuses the two aspects of the god-king, \nwho as Jacob won his battle with the incumbent king and supplanted \nhim, then as Israel lost his battle with the next supplanter, and was \ncastrated. Is-Ra-El may have been a corruption of Isis-Ra-El, the god \nenthroned as the consort of his goddess, awaiting the next challenger. 13 \nThe syllable El meant his deification. \n\nThe garbled story of Jacob and the god-man was inserted chiefly to \nsupport the Jews\' taboo on eating a penis (Genesis 32:32), formerly a \nhabit of sacred kings upon their accession to the throne. The genitals of \nthe defeated antagonist were eaten by the victor, to pass the phallic \nspirit from one "god" to the next. A king\'s virtu, "manliness," or heill, \n"holiness," dwelt in his genitals because that was his point of contact \nwith the Goddess-queen. Innumerable myths of father-castrating, moth- \ner-marrying god-kings arose, not so much from inner Oedipal \njealousies as from actual customs of royal succession in antiquity. See \nKingship; Oedipus. \n\nThe Greek King Aegeus died at the very moment when his "son," \nTheseus, arrived from Crete to claim his throne. The key to this \nmyth is that Aegeus was "rendered sterile" by a curse, the same ritual \ncurse laid on all kings of outworn usefulness, followed very shortly \nby castration and death. 14 \n\n\n\n143 \n\n\n\nCastration In the sacred dramas of Canaan, the reed scepter of the dying god \n\nMot was broken, to signify his castration. 15 His name, meaning "steril- \n^^ mmmm ^^^^^ ity" or "death," was a title of the fertility god Aleyin (Baal) as he \n\nentered his declining phase, when his rival assumed the sacred throne, \nand he became Lord of Death. 16 The custom of eating the defeated \nking\'s genitals appears in a number of Middle-Eastern myths, e.g., that \nof the Hittite god Kumarbi, one of a line of father-castrating kings of \nheaven. 17 Kumarbi\'s assumption of the fertility-spirit was expressed \nby the story that he "became pregnant." \n\nMythic fathers and sons demonstrated remarkable hostility toward \neach other\'s genitals. Scholars tend to regard this as an expression of \nOedipal aggressions, originating in the jealousy of elder males toward \nyounger, more virile ones. Though men eventually gave up the \nhopeless idea of making one of their number pregnant by redesigning \nhis body in a feminine style, customs of castration and crypto- \ncastration persisted because they offered an outlet for this male jealousy. \n\nAmong savages, men\'s puberty ceremonies generally provided an \nexcuse for elder men\'s attacks on the bodies of youths. Modified \ncastrations may be inflicted in the form of circumcision, subincision, and \nother genital wounds; also a variety of torments such as scarifying \nflesh, knocking out teeth, beatings, torture, and homosexual rape. 18 \n"The dramatized anger of both the father and the circumciser and the \nmyths of the original initiation in which all the boys were killed, \ncertainly show the Oedipal aggression of the elder generation as the \nbasic drive behind initiation." 19 \n\nThe more patriarchal the society, the more brutal its attacks on \nmale youth, as a general rule. Notable for brutality was the Moslems\' Es- \nselkh or scarification ceremony, a complete flaying of skin from a \nboy\'s scrotum, penis, and groin. After enduring this, the victim was \nfurther tormented by application of salt and hot sand, and buried up \nto the waist in a dunghill, making subsequent infection almost inevita- \nble. Burton commented, "This ordeal was sometimes fatal." 20 \nLegman pointed out that both Islam and Judaism "share in the surgical \nintimidation of the son by the father, just at the threshold of puberty, \neither in the psychological castration of circumcision at puberty (Mo- \nhammedanism), or this same operation effected at the earlier age of \neight days (Judaism), or in a reminiscence of this operation." 21 \n\nSubincision provides an example of transition from a female- \nimitative rationale to a male sado-masochistic ritual. As practiced by \nthe Arunta, it began with a long sliver of bone inserted into the urethra. \nThe youth\'s penis was then sawed open with a sharp flint, down to \nthe level of the bone. Blood flowing from the wound was directed onto \na sacred fire, like the menstrual blood of girls at menarche. The \noperation was termed "man\'s menstruation." 22 The wound was called a \n"vagina." 23 \n\nThe obvious purpose of this unpleasantness was to transform a \nmale into a pseudo-female. The mutilated youth was even obliged to \nurinate by squatting, like a woman. Sometimes, men renewed the \n\n\n\n144 \n\n\n\ndamage several times over, repeating the litany: "We are not separat- Castration \n\ned from the mother; for we two are one."\' 24 Natives said the custom \n\nwas begun by an ancestral spirit, Mulkari or Mu-Kari, perhaps a _^^__^^^ \n\ncorrupt form of Mother Kali (Ma-Kali), who was known as Kari in ^""^^^^ \n\nMalaysia. 25 \n\nFar from supporting the Freudian doctrine of penis envy, primitive \ncustoms seem to suggest vulva envy as the original motive behind \nritual castrations. It might be found even in civilized society. Bettelheim \nremarked on the desire of some young men to be circumcised, or \notherwise subjected to bloodletting, when their girl friends were starting \nto menstruate. 26 Circumcision was surely a modified form of earlier, \nfemale-imitative castrations. \n\nThe institution of circumcision was attributed to the same gods, \nsuch as El, who castrated their fathers. Its object was to feminize. In \nIndia, boys were dressed as girls, nose ring and all, on the eve of the cir- \ncumcision ceremony. In ancient Egypt also, boys on their way to \ncircumcision wore girls\' clothing, and were followed by a woman \nsprinkling salt, a common Egyptian symbol of life-giving menstrual \nblood. 27 \n\nCircumcision took place at the age of thirteen, the number of \nmonths in a year according to ancient menstrual calendars, and the \ntraditional age of menarche. After copying circumcision from the \nEgyptians, Jews transferred it to the period of infancy, leaving the \npubertal ceremony, now called bar mitzvah, awkwardly placed at a point \nin a boy\'s life when nothing really happens, in contrast to the sudden \nonset of menarche in a girl. \n\nInfant circumcision was attributed to Moses, who insisted on it \nagainst the will of his Midianite wife Zipporah, who apparently \nobjected to mutilation of her infant. After performing the operation, she \nflung the foreskin at Moses\'s feet, calling him a bloody husband \n(Exodus 4:25). \n\nOther biblical passages show that foreskins were considered appro- \npriate offerings to Yahweh. David bought his wife Michal from \nYahweh\'s representative the king, with 200 Philistine foreskins (1 \nSamuel 18:27). Other Heavenly Fathers made similar demands for \ngenital gifts. Male animals sacrificed to Rome\'s Heavenly Father Jupiter \nwere gelded. 28 The bull representing the castrated savior Attis was \nalso castrated. 29 His blood conferred spiritual rebirth on those who \nbathed in it, like the blood of the Christian "Lamb," as if it were the \nsecret blood of the womb, the real source of life according to the oldest \nbeliefs. 30 \n\nCastration as a means of acquiring feminine powers was still evi- \ndent among priesthoods of the Great Mother, along with other \nfemale-imitative devices such as transvestism. Self-emasculated priests in \nfemale clothing served the Indian Goddess under her name of \nHudigamma. 31 Similar eunuch priests tended Middle-Eastern temples \nlike those of the Dea Syria at Hierapolis, Artemis-Diana in Anatolia, \nand the Magna Mater in Phrygia and Rome. 32 The famous seer of \n\n\n\n145 \n\n\n\nCastration Thebes, Teiresias, got his powers of second sight and prophecy by \n\nbecoming a woman, possibly by castration, and living as a temple harlot \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m for seven years. \n\nPerhaps the best-known self-emasculators in the ancient world \nwere priests of Attis and Cybele, the Great Mother. As Attis was \ncastrated and poured out his lifeblood to fructify her, so his priests in \nimitation of his sacrifice cut off their genitals and gave them to the \nGoddess\'s image. 53 Sometimes, the men\'s severed members were \nthrown into houses, as a special blessing. In return, householders gave \nthe new eunuchs feminine garments to wear. Sometimes, the severed \ngenitalia were carried in baskets or cistae to the Mother\'s innermost \nshrine, where they were anointed, even gilded, and solemnly buried in \nthe Bridal Chamber. 34 The phallus of the god himself was carried \ninto the sacred cavern in the form of a large pine log, which was also, \nlike the phallic cross of Middle-Eastern saviors, the instrument on \nwhich he died. 35 His priests, having copied his self-sacrifice, were \ndistinguished by the androgynous title bestowed on the earliest forms \nof Shiva; they were "lords who were half woman." 36 \n\nTertullian admitted that the "divine mysteries" of Christianity \nwere virtually the same as the "devilish mysteries" of pagan saviors \nlike Attis. 37 Popularity of Attis\'s cult in Rome led to Christian adoption \nof some of the older god\'s ways. One of the best-kept secrets of early \nChristianity was its preaching of castration for the special inner circle of \ninitiates, who won extra grace with this demonstration of chastity. \nThey taught, following the Wisdom of Solomon, "Blessed is the \neunuch, which with his hands hath wrought no iniquity." 38 Jesus \nhimself advocated castration: "There be eunuchs, which have made \nthemselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven\'s sake. He that is able \nto receive it, let him receive it" (Matthew 19:12). \n\nSeveral early fathers of the church did receive it. Origen was highly \npraised for having castrated himself. 39 Justin\'s Apologia said proudly \nthat Roman surgeons were besieged by faithful Christian men request- \ning the operation. Tertullian declared, "The kingdom of heaven is \nthrown open to eunuchs." 40 Justin advised that Christian boys be \nemasculated before puberty, so their virtue was permanently protect- \ned. 41 Three Christians who tried to burn Diocletian\'s palace were \ndescribed as eunuchs. 42 \n\nThroughout the middle ages, cathedral choirs included castrati, \nemasculated before puberty to preserve their virtue and their soprano \nvoices, which were considered more pleasing to God than the "impure" \nfemale soprano. Women were not allowed to sing in church choirs, \nanyway. \n\nCastration was advocated also for monks who could not fend off \nthe demons of sexual desire. It was forcibly imposed on the monk \nAbelard, whose love affair with his pupil Heloise caused a scandal in the \nchurch. But there were others who seem to have accepted surgical \nchastity on a voluntary basis. Such men assumed the title of Hesychasti, \n"permanently chaste ones," or "those who are at peace." The title \n\n\n\n146 \n\n\n\nwas associated particularly with the monks of Mount Athos, so carefully \nascetic that even to the present day no female creature is allowed on \nthe holy mountain hens, cows, sows, nanny goats, and women all \nequally forbidden. 43 \n\nIt is likely that Mount Athos was named after Attis, and may have \nbeen a shrine served by his eunuch priests in pre-Christian times, \nsituated close to his Phrygian home. There was a Magna Mater figure \nconnected with Mount Athos up to the early 14th century. The \nmonks were labeled heretics for being too deeply involved with the \nteachings of a certain so-called nun named Irene "Peace," the \nthird persona of Triple Aphrodite embodied in her priestess-Horae. \nIrene, as Crone, would have been the priestess of castrations hinted \nin the myths of such lovers of the Goddess as Anchises and Adonis. 44 \nWhen the church purged Mount Athos of the influence of Irene, the \nabbot Lazarus was expelled. With a companion named Barefooted \nCyril, Lazarus wandered through Bulgaria preaching the redeeming \nvirtues of nakedness and self-emasculation. 45 \n\nIt seems the cult of Attis and Cybele continued to influence \nChristianity in the Balkans for many centuries. Balkan monastic \ncommunities were organized in groups of fifty, like older "colleges" of \nthe Great Mother\'s castrated priests. In Thrace, the Great Mother \nhad the name of Cottyto, mother of the hundred-handed giant Cottus, \nan allegorical figure representing her fifty spiritual sons with two \nhands each. 46 Her worship persisted underground, long enough for the \nchurch to define it as witchcraft, and to label Cottyto a demon. In \n1619 a booklet published in Paris suggested the same Balkan tradition of \nthe priest who dedicated himself to God in a manner that was then \nconsidered heretical: "the devil cut off his privy parts." 47 \n\nRitual castration was again revived by 1 8th-century Russian secta- \nries calling themselves Skoptsi, "castrated ones." 48 They also called \nthemselves People of God, insisting that removal of their genitals \nbrought them profound spiritual powers. Russia\'s "mad monk" \nRasputin was a member of this sect. 49 Since Rasputin was famed for his \naffairs with women, few of his contemporaries would Jiave believed \nhim a eunuch; but they had forgotten what eastern harem-keepers knew \nwell enough: that eunuchs are quite capable of providing women \nwith sexual pleasure. Rasputin\'s hold over his female devotees was in \nany case a curious combination of spiritual and sensual obsession. \n\nl.Budge,G.E.2,89,100. 2. G.R.Scott, 192-93. 3.Hays,412. 4.

Like everything else associated with \nwitchcraft, this idea dated back to ancient Goddess-worship. \n\nThe Teutonic Mother Freya rode in a chariot drawn by cats. 1 \nArtemis-Diana often appeared in cat form, and was identified with \nthe Egyptian cat-goddess Bast. The willow sacred to Hecate became a \npussy-willow that bore "catkins" in the spring. 2 \n\nCat worship began in Egypt, where the first domesticated cats \ndescended from a wild ancestor, felis hbyca? Plutarch said the cat was \ncarved on Isis\'s holy sistrum and represented the moon, "[i]ts activity in \nthe night, and the peculiar circumstances which attend its fecundity \nmaking it a proper emblem of that body. For it is reported of this \ncreature, that it at first brings forth one, then two, afterwards three, \nand so goes on adding one to each former birth till it comes to seven; so \nthat she brings forth twenty-eight in all, corresponding as it were to the \nseveral degrees of light, which appear during the moon\'s revolutions." 4 \n\nThe Egyptian word for cat was Mau, both an imitation of the cat\'s \ncry, and a mother-syllable. Cats were so sacred in Egypt that any man \nwho killed one was condemned to death. Diodorus, a first-century B.C. \nGreek historian, told of a foolish Roman who killed a cat in Egypt and \nwas slain in his own house by an infuriated mob. 5 \n\nBast, the Cat-mother of the city of Bubastis, was the benevolent \naspect of Hathor, the Lioness. Festivals of Bast were joyful with music, \ndancing, jokes, and sexual rites. 6 Her dark side was Hathor as the \nleonine Sphinx, Sekhmet (Greek Sakhmis), tearer and devourer of \nmen. 7 "By my life, when I slay men my heart rejoices," she said. Her \nfeast day commemorated a massacre once perpetrated by Sekhmet the \nGreat Cat. The Egyptian calendar of lucky and unlucky days noted for \nthis one, with inadvertent humor: "Hostile, hostile, hostile is the 12th \nTybi. Avoid seeing a mouse on this day." 8 \n\nMedieval belief in the cat\'s nine lives probably stemmed from the \nEgyptian Ennead, via the mythic figure of the Ninefold Goddess. It was \noften said any witch could assume a cat\'s shape nine times in her life. 9 \nShe could also assume the shape of a hare. 10 Frazer observed: "Cats are \nprecisely the animals into which, with the possible exception of hares, \nwitches were most usually supposed to transform themselves." n \n\nBrought to England, cats were confused with hares as the Moon- \ngoddess\'s totems. The root language of Sanskrit called the moon cacin, \n"that marked with the Hare," but some said the lunar animal might be a \ncat. 12 Queen Boadicea\'s banners bore the device of the moon-hare, \nwhich was also dedicated to the Saxon Goddess Eostre (Easter) at her \nrites of spring: hence the Easter Bunny. Irish peasants still observe the \nmatriarchal taboo on hare meat, saying to eat a hare is to eat one\'s \ngrandmother. 13 Both hares and cats had obviously yonic nicknames: \ncunny, pussy. A rabbit warren is still called a cunnary. 14 \n\n\n\n148 \n\n\n\nTo the Scots, the Goddess of Witches was Mither o\' the Mawkins. Catherine, Saint \n\n"Mawkin" or "malkm" was either a hare or a cat. 15 When the cat \n\nbecame the primary lunar animal, the traditional witch\'s familiar was ^_ ___ \n\nGreymalkin or Grimalkin, a "gray cat." Gray malkins were also the ^^^^^ \n\n"pussies" or "catkins" on the pussy willow, sacred to witches and \nheralding the pagan games of May. \n\nInquisitor Nicholas Remy said all cats were demons. In 1387, \nLombard witches were said to worship the devil as a cat. 16 Christians \nsometimes exposed cats to torture and fire along with witches. At certain \nfestivals, such as Midsummer, Easter, and Shrove Tuesday, it was \ncustomary to burn cats in wicker cages. "The cat, which represented the \ndevil, could never suffer enough." 17 According to Jewish belief, cats \nwere not made by God. The first pair of male and female cats were \n"snorted forth" from the nostrils of a lion on board Noah\'s ark. 18 \n\n1. Turville-Petre, 107; Branston, 133. 2. Graves, CM. 1,115. \n\n3. Encyc.

In the hearts of many people she was second only to the \nvirgin Mary. 1 Yet even Catholic scholars admit her legend is \n"preposterous." 2 \n\nThe key to the secret of St. Catherine is her so-called Catherine \nWheel, the wheel of fire on which she was said to have been \nmartyred. At Sinai, the original center of Catherine\'s cult, the Asiatic \nGoddess was once portrayed as the Dancer on the Fiery Wheel at \nthe hub of the universe. A Greek convent of priestess-nuns at Sinai in \nthe 8th century a.d. called themselves kathari, "pure ones," a word \nakin to the Kathakali temple-dancers of India, who performed the \nDance of Time in honor of Kali, Goddess of the karmic wheel. 5 \n\nThe symbol of the wheel figured prominently in beliefs of medi- \neval Gnostics who called themselves Cathari, and revered St. \nCatherine almost as a female counterpart of God. Perhaps for this \nreason, in the 1 5 th and 16th centuries, after the Cathari were \nexterminated, Catholic prelates made efforts to have St. Catherine \neliminated from the canon. 4 \n\nHer Christian myth made her the standard young beauty dedicated \nto virginity, and so wise she could demolish the arguments of fifty \nphilosophers at once. She refused the hand of the emperor in marriage, \nwhereupon he following the hagiographers\' usual curious pat- \ntern essayed to win her love by having her imprisoned and tortured. \nHer captors tried to break her on the fiery wheel, but the wheel was \n\n\n\n149 \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nshattered by a sudden bolt of lightning and she was saved. In the end, \nshe had to be beheaded. Milk flowed from her veins instead of blood. \nAngels carried her body from Alexandria to Sinai, where her relics were \n"discovered" 500 years later. 5 Her divine bones constantly exuded a \nhealing unguent, which was bottled and sold at great profit to the \nconvent. 6 \n\n1.

The Authorized \nVersion inaccurately \ntranslates sappur as \n"sapphire." 8 \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\nThe symbol commonly opposed to the cross, as the witches\' object \nof worship; in pagan tradition, the Great Mother\'s cosmic womb. As the \n"pot of blood in the hand of Kali," the cauldron signified cyclic \nrecurrence, as opposed to the patriarchal view of linear time. \n\nShakespeare followed the traditional pattern in associating the \ncauldron with three witches, since, from its earliest appearances in \nBronze Age and Iron Age cultures, the cauldron stood for the Triple \nGoddess of fate, or wyrd in Old English: the three Weird Sisters. 1 \n\nThe Egyptian hieroglyphic sign of the threefold Creatress, mother \nof the sun, the universe, and all the gods, was a design of three \ncauldrons. 2 The Norse god Odin stole his divine power from three \ncauldrons of Wise Blood in the cave-womb of the earth, where he \nentered in the shape of a phallic serpent and beguiled the earth-giantess \nby making love to her. 3 Then he drank the magic blood from the \ncauldrons and became a shape-shifter, turning himself into a bird to \ncarry the precious blood back to other gods. This myth was based on \nthat of the Aryan sky-god Indra, who also drank the Goddess\'s ambrosia \nfrom three cauldrons, the three wombs of Kali\'s trinity. 4 Indra stole \nthe elixir by allowing himself to be swallowed by a vast serpent \nrepresenting female sexuality (Kundalini). He too turned into a bird \nto carry the elixir to other gods. \n\nIn nearly all mythologies there is a miraculous vessel. Sometimes it \ndispenses youth and life, at other times it possesses the power of \nhealing, and occasionally, as with the mead cauldron of the Nordic Ymir, \ninspiring strength and wisdom are to be found in it. Often . . . it effects \ntransformations. s \n\nThe cauldron that effected transformations was the same as the \nwomb that churned out rebirths, changing shapes each time. In Babylon \nit was under the control of the Fate-goddess Siris, mother of stars. Her \ncauldron was the blue heaven, where she stirred the mead of \nregeneration. "Siris, the wise woman, the mother, who had done what \nwas necessary. Her cauldron is of shining lapis lazuli. Her tub is of \npure silver and gold. In mead stands jubilation, in mead sits rejoicing." 6 \n\nLapis lazuli was the blue heaven stone prized for its power to cause \nrebirth. The Papyrus of Nekhtu-Amen said an amulet of lapis lazuli \n\n\n\n150 \n\n\n\nstood for the heart (ab), source of mother-blood; therefore the amulet \nwas inserted into a mummy to generate a new heart for the \ndeceased. 7 \n\nChaldean cosmology saw the sky as a nesting of seven vessels, the \nplanetary spheres, like inverted bowls or cauldrons. Beneath the earth \nlay the mirror image of this celestial realm, seven more spheres some- \ntimes described as cauldrons. A Hittite myth called them the vessels \nof Mother Death, dark twin sister of the heavenly Mother Siris: "The \ndoorkeeper has opened the seven doors, has unlocked the seven bolts. \nDown in the dark earth there stand seven cauldrons, their lids oiabaru \nmetal, their handles of iron. Whatever goes in there comes not out \nagain." 9 \n\nEgyptians sometimes saw the seven-circled nether womb as a \nregenerative cauldron called the Lake of Fire. 10 The corresponding \ncelestial vessels were "above heaven." n But the divine cauldron also \nappeared right on earth, within the sacred precincts of the temple. \n\nKing Aeson was resurrected after being boiled in the cauldron of \nMedea, "Mead of Wisdom," eponymous mother goddess of the \nMedes. King Minos too was boiled in the Goddess\'s cauldron and \ndeified in Tartarus, where he became a judge and a Lord of Death. \nUnder the name of Demeter, the Goddess restored Pelops to life in her \ncauldron. 15 According to his inscription at Mount Hermon, the \nRoman emperor Elagabalus was likewise "deified in the cauldron." 16 \n\nSt. John the Evangelist was oddly assimilated to the pagan myth of \nthe regenerative cauldron. He was boiled in it and came forth livelier \nthan before. His symbols were a bleeding heart and a boiling cauldron. 17 \nThe syncretism of the "Feast of St. John at the Latin Gate" \neventually became too embarrassing, and the festival was expunged \nfrom the Christian calendar in I960. 18 The apocryphal St. George, \nhowever, continued to enter the cauldron as one of his alleged tortures. \nBy making the sign of the cross, he rendered it lukewarm and \nharmless, an example of a matriarchal symbol made subordinate to a \npatriarchal one. 19 \n\nAmong the Celts of Gaul and Britain, the Cauldron of Regen- \neration was the central religious mystery: reincarnation within the womb \nof the Goddess. The Irish who worshipped the threefold Morrigan \ncalled the second person of her trinity Badb, "Boiling," the producer of \nlife, wisdom, inspiration, and enlightenment. 20 \n\nTo Welsh bards she was the Goddess Branwen, "one of the three \nMatriarchs of the Island," owner of the Cauldron of Regeneration in \nwhich dead men could be resuscitated overnight. 21 As "a powerful fairy \nqueen," the Lady of the Lake of the Basin, she dwelt in a sacred lake \nfrom which her brother Bran the Blessed raised the cauldron later \nknown as the Holy Grail. 22 This pagan god was Christianized as \nBron, alleged brother-in-law of Joseph of Arimathea who was supposed \nto have brought the Grail to Britain. Actually, the Grail was well \nestablished in British paganism long before its legend was assimilated to \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nLarge cauldrons in \nEgyptian temples were \ncalled shi, the \nprototype of the brass \n"sea" in Solomon\'s \ntemple, which was \ncertainly a Cauldron \nof Regeneration. 12 \nBabylonian temples \nhad the same vessel, \ncalled apsu or \n"abyss," for baptism, \nceremonial lavage, \nand rebirth rituals." \nSuch a "sea" was \nalso called "the Deep," \ntehom in Hebrew.\' * \nLike the Christian \nbaptismal font \ndescended from these \nforerunners, the \ncauldron or "sea" was a \nwomb symbol. \nSolomon\'s "sea" \nrepresented his \nGoddess, Ashtoreth \n(Astarte). It was \ndecorated with her \nyonic lilies: "The \nbrim thereof was \nwrought like the \nbrim of a cup, with \nflowers of lilies" \n(1 Kings 7:26). \n\n\n\n151 \n\n\n\nCauldron that of Christ. 23 Branwen, Goddess of the Cauldron, had yet another \n\nincarnation in medieval romance as Brangwain, the wise-woman who \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m gave Tristan and Iseult their fatal love potion. 24 \n\nThe Goddess had earthly incarnations too. Childeric, son of \nMerovech or Merovig, founder of the first dynasty of French kings, \nmarried a druidess named Basina (Cauldron), who foretold the future of \nhis dynasty. 25 \n\nLike the "seas" in ancient temples, the Cauldron of Regeneration \nalso had its counterparts on earth. Each Celtic temple had its sacred \ncauldron. Aubrey\'s A Natural History of Surrey mentioned a pagan \ncauldron still preserved in Frensham Church, "an extraordinary great \nkettle or cauldron" brought by the fairies, according to local legend. 26 \nAn 8th-century Salic Law against priestesses or, as the church \ncalled them, witches prohibited the pagan practice of "bearing the \ncauldron" in procession to "the places where they cook." 27 \n\nThe Welsh bard Taliesin claimed to have received the mead of \nwisdom from his mother, the Goddess Cerridwen, "the Celtic Great \nMother, the Demeter." 28 \n\nShe resolved, according to the arts of the books ofFferyllt (Fairy-wisdom)., \nto boil a Cauldron of Inspiration and Science for her son . . . which \nfrom the beginning of its boiling might not cease to boil for a year and a \nday, until three blessed drops were obtained of the Grace of \nInspiration. 29 \n\nTaliesin\'s poetry contained oblique allusions to the magic caul- \ndron, couched in the semi-opaque terms that concealed mystical secrets \nfrom the uninitiated. His "year and a day" was a reference to the \nlunar calender of the pagans, a year of thirteen 28-day lunar months, \n364 days, with one more day to make 365. The same "year and a \nday" occurred in many fairy tales. (See Menstrual Calendar.) Talie- \nsin\'s Preiddeu Annwn (Harrowings of Hell) spoke of the Nine \nMaidens, priestesses of the perpetual fire that boiled the symbolic world \ncauldron; and of the yonic shrine, Hel\'s gate, to which the king\'s \nsword (or phallus) was lifted: \n\nIn Caer Pedryvan (four times revolving) \n\nThe Word from the cauldron it would be spoken \n\nBy the breath of nine maidens it would be kindled, \n\nThe head of Hades \'s cauldron what is it like? \n\nA rim it has, with pearls round its border; \n\nIt boils not a cowards food: it would not be perjured. \n\nThe sword ofLlwch Lleawc would be lifted to it. \n\nAnd in the hand ofLleminawc was it left. \n\nAnd before the door of Hell\'s gate lamps were burning, \n\nAnd when we accompanied Arthur, a brilliant effort, \n\nSeven alone did we return from Caer Veddwit. i0 \n\nNine sisters were the same as the nine Goddesses of the \nFortunate Isles ruled by Morgan le Fay, and the nine Muses of Greek \nmyth, and the pre-Hellenic ninefold Goddess Nonacris, queen of the \n\n\n\n152 \n\n\n\nStygian birth-gate. 51 She, or they, came from Oriental traditions almost \nas old as civilization. During their Bronze Age Shang period, the \nChinese represented the Great Goddess of birth by nine tripod caul- \ndrons like the mixing-vessels of the Muses. 32 \n\nThe primitive cult of the cauldron obviously discouraged "cow- \nards" because it was cult of martyrdom. Like Christian martyrs, the \ncauldron\'s victims were promised immediate resurrection into a life of \nglory. Strabo spoke of Cimbrian priestesses who sacrificed men, \nmaking them divine heroes, and caught their blood in magic cauldrons \nand read omens in their entrails. 33 \n\nSome myths hint at cannibal cauldrons large enough to boil a \nhuman body, and beliefs that death in the cauldron was not really \ndeath. A gypsy legend spoke of a hero forced by a mystic Lady to milk \ndangerous mares, then bathe in a boiling cauldron of their milk. A \ngod in the form of a royal horse promised to breathe frost on the \ncauldron and render it comfortably lukewarm. 34 The story recalls the \nCorinthians\' "man-eating mares," or horse-masked priestesses, who \ncaused Bellerophon to mount to heaven on the royal horse Pegasus, \nsymbol of apotheosis after death. 35 \n\nHorseback riding is a sign of deification on the famous silver \nsacrificial cauldron recovered from a Gundestrup peat bog. Manufac- \ntured about 100 B.C., the vessel showed a ceremony of sacrifice. Victims \nappear to be identified with the Horned God, Cernunnos, seated in a \nyogi\'s lotus position holding male and female symbols, the serpent and \ntore. 36 On foot, a row of victims approach the sacred cauldron which \nis shield-shaped and double-lobed, resembling a yoni. A priest or \npriestess is shown plunging one victim headfirst into the vessel. 37 \nAbove, the heroes depart glorified, on horseback, riding literally into the \nsunset, which represented heaven. Cernunnos himself was dismem- \nbered and cooked in a cauldron to rise again, which made him the \nobvious god for such rites. 38 \n\nA scene similar to that of the Gundestrup Cauldron occurs on a \nsacred cista from Palestrina-Praeneste. Rome\'s Mother of Time, \nAnna Perenna, appears to the dying god Mars in the guise of his virgin \nbride, Minerva. She stands over her naked lover and pushes his head \ndown into a boiling cauldron, while the dog of the underworld gate \nlooks on, as also on the Gundestrup example. 39 \n\nSome pagan Mysteries employed visions of the Cauldron as \nsymbolic death and rebirth. Before a Siberian shaman could practice, \nhe was required to undergo hallucinatory experiences of being chopped \nto pieces and boiled in a cauldron, sometimes for a period as long as \nthree years. Yakut, Buryat, and other tribes say the shaman must be \nkilled by the spirits of ancestors, cooked in their magic cauldron, then \ngiven new flesh. "Shaman" comes from Tungusic saman, "one who \ndied," a man assimilated to the Lord of Death called Samana in \nSanskrit. Tibetan shamans made the soul-journey to the "Great Hell" \npictured as an iron cauldron, called House of Iron or Iron Mountain. \n\n\n\nCauldron \n\n\n\nStrabo Greek \ntraveler, geographer, \nand historian of the \nfirst century B.C., a \nfollower of the Stoic \nfaith. \n\n\n\nCimbri Germanic \ntribes from Jutland, \nwhich Romans called \nthe Cimbrian peninsula. \nIn the 2nd century \nB.C., a Cimbrian army \nmarched against \nRome and caused great \nconsternation in the \ncity. \n\n\n\n153 \n\n\n\nCave \n\n\n\nThere the aspirant was dismembered by rakshasas obsolete ancestral \ndeities and boiled, not in punishment for sin but as an initiatory \nprocedure. 40 \n\nSkald-shamans of Scandinavia made the same soul-journey to \nHvergelmir, the Mighty Roaring Cauldron, source of life-giving \nwaters at the foundations of the earth. This was another version of the \ntriple cauldron in the earth-womb, from which Odin received inspira- \ntion and power. Hvergelmir was triple too, accompanied by the fount of \nwisdom and memory called Mimir (an archaic "mother"), and the \nfount of ongoing life called Urdarbrunner, the stream of Mother Earth. \nFounts and cauldrons in the earth were tended by the three Fates \n(Norns), of whom the first was Mother Earth herself. 41 \n\nEven when the Cauldron of Regeneration entered Christian \ntradition as the Holy Grail, supposedly the chalice of Christ\'s last \nsupper, it was referred to as an escuele or "cauldron." 42 Arthur\'s knights \noriginally sought the Grail in the underworld of Annwn, receiving \ntheir divine vision of it in the castle of Elaine, or Elen, the virgin aspect \nof the triple Moon-goddess. It appeared in her hands, heralded by her \nyonic dove. It meant death for her chosen one, Galahad, who reigned as \na sacred king, then died at the altar as he saw his vision of the Grail. 43 \n\nThe Cistercian Estoire del Saint Graal said "two heathen rulers," \nMordrain and Nascien (Death and Rebirth) were blinded by the \nvision of the Grail, but healed by the touch of the lance that pierced \nChrist, both of these objects being kept in the same sanctuary. 44 The \nmotive seems to have been to belittle the female symbol (grail) in favor \nof the male symbol (lance). \n\n1.

Neoplatonist \nphilosopher, scholar, \nand writer; biographer \nof Plotinus; an \nopponent of the \nChristian church, \nwhich eventually \ndestroyed most of his \nbooks. \n\n\n\nCave \n\nPorphyry said before there were temples, all religious rites took place \nin caves. 1 The cave was universally identified with the womb of Mother \nEarth, the logical place for symbolic birth and regeneration. Etruscan \nand Roman temples featured a subterranean mundus, meaning both \n"earth" and "womb." 2 Similarly, the Sanskrit word for a sanctuary, \ngarbha-grha, meant "womb." 3 \n\nHoly places of Hinduism were caves representing the Great \n\n\n\n154 \n\n\n\nX \n\n\n\nMother\'s yoni. Many gompas (holy hermitages) were first established Cave \n\nin caves. Like the^mountain of paradise, home of the gods, the Four \n\nGreat Caves of Sikkim were distinguished according to the four ^^^^^___^_ \n\ncardinal points. North is the cave of the god\'s hill; west, the cave of great \n\nhappiness; south, the cave of occult fairies; east, the secret cave, from \n\nwhich the sun is born. 4 \n\nAmong the oldest forms of the Hindu Goddess was Kurukulla, a" \nmatrikadevi colored red like the womb, and called Mother of Cav- \nerns. 5 As an emanation of Kali she was worshipped in cave-temple \ncomplexes like Ellora, Ajanta, Elephanta. Her western counterpart \nwas Phrygian Cybele, "Cavern-dweller," the Great Mother of the \nGods. A Latin form of her name was Sybil, the prophetic spirit in the \ncavern-dwelling Cumaean sybils, by whose order the Great Mother of \nthe Gods was brought to Rome in 204 b.c. \n\nCybele\'s castrated priests claimed none of their brotherhood ever \ndied. Instead, they went "down into the cavern" to be united with \ntheir Goddess. Cybele\'s cavern-shrines were also called marriage cham- \nbers, like the pastos of Eleusis. The Alexandrian poet Nicander called \nthem "marriage bowers of Rhea Lobrine." 6 They were also the "sacred \nsubterranean places" where those who had emasculated themselves \nin honor of Attis and Cybele used to come to deposit the offering of \ntheir genitals. 7 \n\nRhea was the Cretan name of the same Goddess, during the long \nperiod when fatherhood was unknown or negligible in Cretan soci- \nety. 8 All life was supposed to have arisen from her uterine cave on \nMount Dicte, whence came the e-dicts of her holy law; hence her \ntitle of Dictynna, Lawgiver. She was also called Britomartis the "sweet \nvirgin," the mother without a spouse. 9 From the same uterine cave \nshe gave birth to Zeus, who later claimed to be Father of Gods. \n\nCave-temples of Rhea Dictynna evolved into dicteria, which the \nLaws of Solon designated public brothels. In the era of the promiscu- \nous priestesses, words for cave, temple, and brothel were often \ninterchangeable. 10 To visit the cave and lie with the holy harlot was \nan act of worship. During the early Christian era, most pagan mystery \ncults celebrated their most sacred rites in caves or underground \nchambers. \n\nFollowers of Mithra considered the cave so essential to proper \nworship that, if the site of a temple had no natural cave, an artificial \none was dug. The cave on the Vatican belonged to Mithra until 376 \na.d., when a city prefect suppressed the cult of the rival Savior and \nseized the shrine in the name of Christ, on the very birthday of the \npagan god, December 25. 11 \n\nDespite the church\'s efforts at suppression, the old deities contin- \nued to be worshipped in sacred caves for many centuries. So many \n"grottoes" contained pagan idols that decorative ideas for cathedral \nsculptures were copied from them: hence the grotesques or "grotto- \ncreatures" swarming in Gothic art. As late as the 1 5th century, Pope \n\n\n\n155 \n\n\n\nCave Calixtus II tried to forbid religious ceremonies in sacred caves. 12 As \n\nentrances to the underworld, caves were still associated with the Great \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ Mother\'s yonic gate. A long-revered gate to the womb of the world \nwas a sea-cave on the southern Peloponnese near the shrine of Mar- \nmari Mother Mari, the Sea-goddess whose other names were \nAphrodite Marina, Marah, and Mary. 13 \n\nUp to the 1 8th century, a cave called Tangrogo in Denbighshire \nwas kept by "three fairy sisters" the three Fates whose footprints \nwere often seen around the edge of its magic pool. The cave was said to \ncontain "hidden treasures," a term that often meant paraphernalia of \nthe Old Religion. 14 \n\nSpenser said the hidden treasures of the Faery Queen\'s Bower of \nBliss were the same as those of the virgin Mary\'s secret "enclosed \ngarden": a magic pool of regeneration, a Tree of Life, singing birds, \napples, and roses, including the central Rose of Love. Andreas \nCapellanus said the grotto of the pagan Goddess was a Palace of Love \nin the center of the earth (in medio mundi), with the male and \nfemale symbols of a Tree of Life and a sacred spring. 15 \n\nSacred caves were still used as "marriage bowers" long after \npaganism had been forced underground literally. Bards who adored \nthe heretical Goddess of Love (Minne) mentioned certain Grottoes of \nLove, hewn by heathen giants in the wild mountains, where people \ncould hide when "they wished privacy to make love." Gottfried von \nStrassburg said whenever such a cave was found, it was sealed with a \nbronze door inscribed La fossiure a le gent amant, the Grotto for People \nin Love.

Ceres\'s greatest annual festival, the Cerealia, was celebrated \nin the British Isles almost to the present day.

Their greatest hero, Talie- \nsin, a founder of their craft, was said to have been born of Cerridwen \nand specially treated by her to a few precious drops of magical \ninspiration from her Cauldron. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 168. 2.

In the classic chakra, each man had his wife or shakti to his \nleft, while the Lord of the Chakra with his shakti occupied the center of \nthe circle. 3 European pagan religions maintained the same arrange- \nment, which eventually became the pattern of the circular folk dance. \n\n1.

He was the \nsecond Constantine. He found it useful to be a Christian, since the \nchurch condoned his wars of acquisition as pagan tribal religions \nwould not and took its share of the spoils, eventually rewarding \nCharlemagne with the crown of the Empire. He was also allowed a \nspecial status of matrimony, not granted to other men. He had four \nwives and innumerable concubines, which the church tolerantly de- \nscribed as "marriages of the second rank." \' \n\nCharlemagne\'s reign was a painful history of aggression against the \nmatriarchal religions of his ancestors. In 772 he massacred more than \n4000 Saxons and destroyed their shrine at Heresburg, an omphalos of \nthe earth-mother Hera. He cut down the phallic tree trunk Irminsul, \n"Column of the World," the same axis mundi that Greeks called the \nGreat Herm, Norwegians called Yggdrasil, and Christians called the \ncross. 2 \n\nAfter destroying shrines to demoralize the pagan clans, Charle- \nmagne imposed vassalage on them and converted them to \nChristianity by the simple offer of a choice between Christ and \nimmediate death. All who rejected baptism were to be slain at once. \nIn 33 years of constant war, Charlemagne built the Holy Roman \nEmpire, at the cost of so many lives that historians have not even \ntried to estimate the extent of the slaughter. 3 \n\nCharlemagne\'s policy of conversion by the sword succeeded so \nwell that the church backed Christian rulers in this kind of military \nactivity ever since. As the Song of Roland put it: "The bishops bless the \nwaters and convert the heathen. If any man protests, he is burned or \nput to the sword." 4 \n\nSometimes the blessed waters themselves served to execute the \nunregenerate heathen. It was said that converts made under the rule \nof St. Goar were held under water until they either accepted Christ, or \ndrowned. 5 \n\n1. Murstein, 143. 2. Reinach, 144. 3. H. Smith, 251. \n4.

The British \nParliament passed an odd law in 1 770 that hinted at the same archetypal \nfears, making it illegal for a woman to "betray" any man into \nmatrimony with such artificialities as false hair, iron stays, high-heeled \nshoes, or perfume. If a husband demonstrated that his wife had used \nsuch devices, the marriage would be annulled, and the woman would \n"incur the penalty of the law now enforced against witchcraft." 2 \n\nWomen\'s singing was also highly suspect, as this was the classic \nmethod of casting spells. "Enchant" came from incantare, "to sing \nover" which also meant incantation. 3 \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 49. 2. Murstein, 227. 3.

The dead were buried with coins in the mouth or on the \neyelids to pay Charon\'s ferry. The Chinese also used to put money in \ngraves, for crossing the river of death. In the Balkans, it was said a \nwoman could make her husband "blind as a corpse" to her adultery, \nif she gave him water that had washed the coins from a corpse\'s eyes. 1 \nCharon\'s fee was Christianized as Peter\'s Penny: St. Peter\'s bribe for \nopening the heavenly gates. 2 In Greece, Charon found a new Christian \nidentity as St. Charus, escort and guardian of souls in the "lower \nworld," or common home of the dead. 3 \n\nl.Frazer,FO.T.,35. 2.

Lamusse, 283. \n\n\n\nCherry \n\nLike many slang expressions, the use of "cherry" for "virginity" may \nbe traced to a mythic past. Like other red fruits, such as the apple and \npomegranate, the cherry symbolized the Virgin Goddess: bearing her \nsacred blood color and bearing its seed within, like a womb. \n\nMaya, the virgin mother of Buddha, embraced the cherry tree Sala \nwhile giving birth to her divine child. 1 Some said the tree recognized \nher divinity and bent its branches down to offer its fruit. The story was \ncarried to Europe and spawned the medieval Cherry Tree Carol, in \nwhich Maya became Mary. \n\nGypsies applied the love-magic of the cherry to many magic \ncharms, especially those associated with virginity. When a gypsy girl \ndesired to attract a lover, she drilled holes through fourteen cherry \nstones on the fourteen nights of the waxing moon, and wore them on \n\n\n\n163 \n\n\n\nCherub a cord around her left thigh (the "female" side). 2 The obvious elements \n\nChimalman of this magic were penetration of the cherry, and building up to the \n\n^^ m mm m ^ m ^ m m mm full moon, indicating growth or pregnancy. \n\nFrench traditions of courtly love perhaps made "cherry" (cerise) \nsynonymous with "beloved" (cherie).

Brit, "Everest, Sir George." \n\n\n\nChristina, Saint \n\nAnother apocryphal "virgin martyr," whose legend was constructed \non no basis whatever, except the name, meaning "a female Christian." \nHer story was one of those sadistic wonder-tales in which Christian \nwriters delighted, piling torture upon torture in fantasies that quite lost \nsight of the natural limitations of human flesh. \n\nFor refusing to burn incense to the pagan gods, Christina was \nlocked up in a tower by her father. She was stripped and beaten with \nrods, then torn apart by hooks, and her limbs were broken. Nothing \ndaunted, she took up pieces of her own flesh and threw them in her \nfather\'s face, saying, "Take, tyrant, and eat the flesh thou hast begot- \nten!" So her father then had her sprinkled with oil and roasted on a \nfire-wheel. Then she was thrown into the sea with a stone around her \nneck. Angels saved her, and she returned to her father, who dropped \ndead of frustration. \n\nChristina\'s torments were continued by a judge named Elius, who \nhad her rocked in a red-hot iron cradle. Her next judge, Julian, threw \nher into a burning furnace, where she walked about unbumed for five \ndays. Then, poisonous snakes were hung about her neck. Then, her \nbreasts were cut off, and her tongue cut out. She took a piece of her \ntongue and threw it at Julian, striking him in the eye and blinding \nhim. Finally, Julian killed her by shooting three arrows into her. 1 This \ncan only have been a magic form of destruction, for Christina had by \nthis time amply demonstrated her invulnerability to every ordinary \nmethod of execution. \n\nIt de Voragine, 366-68. \n\n\n\n165 \n\n\n\nChristmas Christmas \n\nFor its first three centuries, the Christian church knew no birthday \nmttmmmmmmKmmm for its savior. During the 4th century there was much argument about \nadoption of a date. Some favored the popular date of the Koreion, \nwhen the divine Virgin gave birth to the new Aeon in Alexandria. 1 Now \ncalled Twelfth Night or Epiphany, this date is still the official nativity \nin Armenian churches, and celebrated with more pomp than Christmas \nby the Greek Orthodox. 2 \n\nRoman churchmen tended to favor the Mithraic winter-solstice \nfestival called Dies Natalis Solis Invictus, Birthday of the Uncon- \nquered Sun. 3 blended with the Greek sun-festival of the Helia by the \nemperor Aurelian, this December 25 nativity also honored such gods \nas Attis, Dionysus, Osiris, Syrian Baal, and other versions of the solar \nSon of Man who bore such titles as Light of the World, Sun of \nRighteousness, and Savior. 4 Most pagan Mysteries celebrated the birth \nof the Divine Child at the winter solstice. Norsemen celebrated the \nbirthday of their Lord, Frey, at the nadir oi the sun in the darkest days of \nwinter, known to them as Yule. The night of birth, Christmas Eve, \nwas called Modranect, Latin matrum noctem, the Night of the Moth- \ner originally a greater festival than Christmas Day. 5 \n\nEarly in the 4th century the Roman church adopted December 25 \nbecause the people were used to calling it a god\'s birthday. But \neastern churches refused to honor it until 375 a.d. 6 The fiction that \nsome record existed in the land of Jesus\'s alleged birth certainly could \nnot be upheld, for the church of Jerusalem continued to ignore the \nofficial date until the 7th century. 7 \n\nTrappings such as Yule logs, gifts, lights, mistletoe, holly, carols, \nfeasts, and processions were altogether pagan. They were drawn from \nworship of the Goddess as mother of the Divine Child. Christmas trees \nevolved from the pinea silva, pine groves attached to temples of the \nGreat Mother. On the night before a holy day, Roman priests called \ndendrophori or "tree-bearers" cut one of the sacred pines, decorated \nit, and carried it into the temple to receive the effigy of Attis. 8 Figures \nand fetishes attached to such trees in later centuries seem to have \nrepresented a whole pantheon of pagan deities on the World Tree. \n\nChristmas celebrations remained so obviously pagan over the years \nthat many churchmen bitterly denounced their "carnal pomp and \njollity." Polydor Virgil said: "Dancing, masques, mummeries, stage- \nplays, and other such Christmas disorders now in use with Christians, \nwere derived from these Roman Saturnalian and Bacchanalian festivals; \nwhich should cause all pious Christians eternally to abominate \nthem." 9 Puritans in 17th-century Massachusetts tried to ban Christmas \naltogether because of its overt heathenism. 10 Inevitably, the attempt \nfailed. \n\nA curious mistake in the Christmas mystery play of the Towneley \ncycle shows a Great Mother image not fully assimilated to that of \nMary. Before their attention was arrested by the annunciatory angel, \n\n\n\n166 \n\n\n\nidly chatting shepherds complained of their cruel overlords, and Christos \n\nprayed "Our Lady" to curse them. 11 Considering that they were not \n\nacquainted with the Mother of Christ, a rather different "Lady" must ^^^^_^_^^ \n\nhave been intended. \n\nAmong many other superstitions connected with Christmas were \nsome that were typical of pagan holy days, such as the belief that \nanimals could speak human words at midnight on Christmas Eve, or \nthat divinatory voices could be heard at crossroads at the same time. 12 \nAlso at midnight on Christmas Eve, water in wells and springs was \nsupposed to turn into blood, or its sacramental equivalent, wine. The \nmiracle was not to be verified, however; for all who witnessed it would \ndie within the year. 13 \n\n1. Campbell, M.I., 34. 2. Miles, 22. 3. Reinach, 282. \n\n4. H.

In the east, the god\'s lingam or the erect penis of his \nstatue was anointed with holy oil (Greek chrism) for easier penetration \nof his bride, the Goddess, impersonated by one of the temple virgins. 1 \nBefore anointing with oil, the god\'s phallus was often reddened to the \ncolor of life with pigment, wine, or blood specifically, the menstru- \nal blood of his bride. 2 Because kingship once depended on the sacred \nmarriage, anointing became the official rite of investiture for surro- \ngate kings as well as real kings. It carried a promise of godhood. \n\nThe words of the psalmist, "Thou anointest my head with oil," \nevolved from the ancient custom of anointing the god-king\'s penis, \nfor which "head" was a common euphemism. At royal weddings the \nking\'s head was crowned with a wreath of flowers, as in the Hindu \nsvayamara ceremony and flowers, in biblical language, symbolized \nmenstrual blood (Leviticus 15:24). Among the pagans, the temple \nvirgin deflowering herself on the god\'s carved phallus would place a \nwreath of flowers on his head at the same time. 3 Eventually the \nanointing of the phallus was displaced to the head because the marriage \nrite was omitted from public sacrifices of the Savior, Redeemer, Son \nof God, etc. Like the New Testament Christ, he was "anointed" only \nfor his burying: the marriage with the earth (John 12:7). Jesus \nbecame a Christos when he was christ-ened for burial by Mary, the \nmagdalene or temple maiden (Matthew 26:12), who also announced \nhis resurrection (Mark 1 5:47). \n\nAmong the Essenes, a Christos was a priest, specifically designated \nSin Bearer or Redeemer: one who atoned for others\' sins. 4 Among \nthe Slavs, Christos or Krstnik meant a sacrificial hero and also an \n\n\n\n167 \n\n\n\nChthonia "accursed one," due to the ancient practice of laying a formal curse \n\nCirce on the Sin Bearer before he was sacrified. 5 See Firstborn; Kingship. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ 1 .

Leland, 145. \n\n\n\nChthonia \n\n"Subterranean," an epithet of Black Demeter, Cybele, and other \nunderground forms of the Goddess; also applied to gods in their nether, \ndark, Lord-of-Death aspect, e.g. Zeus Chthonios, or Chthonian \nApollo. \n\nCinderella \n\nThe fairy tale of the cinder-maid originated as an anti-ecclesiastical \nallegory repeated by real "fairies" that is, pagans. Ella was Hel, or \nHelle, daughter of Mother Earth, the Goddess with her regenerative \nfires reduced to cinders. Her ugly stepmother was the new church. Her \nugly stepsisters were the church\'s darlings, the military aristocracy and \nthe clergy. \n\nAn early German version of the story said Cinderella\'s real mother \nthe Earth, though dead, sent from her grave a fairy tree in answer to \nher daughter\'s prayer. This tree produced golden apples, fine clothes, \nand other gifts. Thus the "fairy godmother" of later versions seems to \nhave been a ghost of the mother, the dispossessed Great Goddess in \nretirement underground. 1 \n\nBeautified with her new riches, Cinderella won the "prince" \n(mankind), ever easily impressed by the display of finery. Their union \nwas symbolized by fitting her foot into a shoe, a common sexual \nallegory. The Eleusinian Mysteries signified sacred marriage by \nworking a phallic object in a woman\'s shoe. 2 The glass slipper perhaps \nstood for the Crystal Cave by which pagan heroes entered the uterine \nunderworld. \n\nLike other secret medieval prophecies of the overthrow of the rich, \npowerful theocracy, the downfall of Cinderella\'s ugly stepmother and \nstepsisters may have been intended as a prophecy. 3 \n\n1.

Circe\'s isle of Aeaea was a funerary shrine. Its \nname meant "Wailing." Circe herself was the death-bird kirkos, falcon. \nFrom the same root came the Latin circus, originally an enclosure for \nfunerary games. 1 \n\n\n\n168 \n\n\n\nm \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the circle, or cirque, Circe was identical with Omphale of Lydia Circumcision \n\nwith her cosmic spinning wheel: a fate-spinner, weaver of the Cleopatra VII \n\ndestinies of men. 2 Homer called her Circe of the Braided Tresses, ^^__ \n\nhinting that, like Oriental goddesses, she manipulated forces of \ncreation and destruction by the knots and braids in her hair. She ruled \nall the stars that determined men\'s fates. Pliny said Circe was a \nGoddess who "commanded all the lights of heaven." 3 \n\n1. Lindsay, O.A., 239. 2. Graves, G.M. 2, 358. 3.

Originally an imitation of menstrua- \ntion, performed at puberty on boys who were dressed up as girls for \nthe occasion. 1 Circumcision came to be regarded as a sacrifice pleasing \nto a male deity, when it was viewed as a substitute for castration. \n\nl.Gifford,42. \n\n\n\nClare, Saint var. Saint Claire \n\nMythical saint constructed from the title of the Celtic Goddess, \nSinclair, "Sacred Light." \' The original form remained, as a popular \nsurname. \n\n1. Hitching, 212. \n\n\n\nCleopatra VII \n\nOne of the last Goddess-queens of Egypt, Cleopatra followed the \nprecedent of Egyptian rulers in general and turned herself into a \ndivinity. At an Alexandrian festival she "assumed the robe of Isis and \nwas addressed as the New Isis." \' \n\nThough she was not a native Egyptian, but one of the Macedo- \nnian family of Ptolemies, Cleopatra exercised the ancient \nprerogatives of Egyptian queens. Julius Caesar became her lover be- \ncause it was the only way he could annex Egypt to the Roman \nprovinces. By time-honored law, no man could exercise political power \nin Egypt unless he loved its queen. \n\nSome of Cleopatra\'s less eminent lovers lasted only one night and \npaid with their lives for a single taste of her love. 2 The custom seems \nto have been adopted by later male rulers of Arabia, to judge by the \ngynocidal sultan of the Arabian Nights. The thinking behind this \ncustom remains mysterious. It may be that men who lay with the queen \n(and therefore with the Goddess herself) were believed to gain \nimmortality thereby, for any man who coupled with a Goddess would \nbecome a God. Sacred marriage, followed by death and deification, \nformed the basic pattern of many ancient Mysteries. \n\n\n\n169 \n\n\n\nClitoris \n\n\n\nWhen her son Caesarion was born, Cleopatra built herself a \nmammisi or "birth temple" for the worship of her own maternity. In \nthe shrine she was pictured in the act of giving birth, assisted by the \nSeven Hathors. 3 Cleopatra\'s mammisi stood until the 19th century \na.d., when it was described by travelers, but it disappeared in the past \ncentury. 4 \n\nShe also gave birth to the sun and moon, in the form of twins \nnamed Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene Alexander-Sun and \nCleopatra-Moon. 5 Perhaps these children represented her own mating \nwith the solar god of Alexandria. \n\n1.

Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the \nancient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nClitoris \n\nFrom Greek kleitoris, "divine, famous, goddess-like." l Greek myth \npersonified the phallus as Priapus and the clitoris as an Amazon queen \nnamed Kleite, ancestral mother of the Kleitae, a tribe of warrior \nwomen who founded a city in Italy. 2 In Corinth, Kleite was a princess \n"whom Artemis made grow tall and strong," an allegory of her \nerection. 3 Or, again, she was a nymph who loved the phallus of the sun \ngod and always followed his motion with her "head" a transparently \nsexual metaphor. 4 In a bowdlerized version of the story she was \ntransformed into a sunflower, turning to follow the motion of the sun \nacross the sky. \n\nPausanias said the Arcadian city of Clitor was sacred to Artemis, or \nto Demeter, and stood at the genital shrine of the earth, the \nheadwaters of the Styx (or Alph). 5 The meaning of this geographical \nmyth is made clear by the primitive belief that the Styx represented \nMother Earth\'s menstrual blood, source and solvent of all things. In \nthis place, too, the orgiastic priestesses of Artemis were "soothed" out \nof their frenzies; therefore the local omphalos must have signified the \nGoddess\'s clitoris instead of her navel. \n\nLater patriarchal society managed to ignore the clitoris. Since the \nChristian church taught that women should not experience sexual \npleasure but should only endure intercourse for the sake of procreation, \ngrowing girls and boys alike were kept ignorant of female sexuality, \ninsofar as possible. 6 Even physicians came to believe that no clitoris \nwould be found on a virtuous woman. \n\nFrom medieval times onward, virtuous women rarely showed \nthemselves naked to any man, even a husband; so it was perhaps not \nsurprising that men should remain ignorant of the female anatomy they \nclumsily fumbled with in the dark. Pious married couples wore the \nchemise cagoule, a voluminous nightgown with a small hole in front, to \nallow impregnation with a minimum of body contact. 7 \n\n\n\n170 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a witch trial in 1 593, the investigating gaoler (a married man) Clitoris \n\napparently discovered a clitoris for the first time, and identified it as a \n\ndevil\'s teat, sure proof of the witch\'s guilt. It was "a little lump of flesh, ^^^^^^^^^ \nin manner sticking out as if it had been a teat, to the length of half an \ninch," which the gaoler, "perceiving at the first sight thereof, meant not \nto disclose, because it was adjoining to so secret a place which was not \ndecent to be seen; yet in the end, not willing to conceal so strange a \nmatter," he showed it to various bystanders. 8 The bystanders had \nnever seen anything like it either. The witch was convicted. \n\nEuropean society certainly knew all about the penis, and never \nceased to worship it, evert in Christian times (see Phallus Worship). \nYet the clitoris was forgotten: \n\nAlmost from the very beginning of our lives, we are all taught that the \nprimary male sex organ is the penis, and the primary female sex organ \nis the vagina. These organs are supposed to define the sexes, to be the \ndifference between boys and girls .... This is a lie ... . Woman \'s \nsexual pleasure is often left out of these definitions. If people considered \nthat the purpose of the female sex organs is to bring pleasure to \nwomen, then female sex would be defined by, and focused on, a different \norgan. Everyone would be taught from infancy that, as the primary \nmale sex organ is the penis, so the primary female sex organ is the clitoris. 9 \n\nMedical authorities in the 19th century seemed anxious to \nprevent women from discovering their own sexuality. Girls who learned \nto develop orgasmic capacity by masturbation, just as boys learned it, \nwere regarded as medical problems. Often they were "treated" or \n"corrected" by amputation or cautery of the clitoris, or "miniature \nchastity belts, sewing the vaginal lips together to put the clitoris out of \nreach, and even castration by surgical removal of the ovaries. But \nthere are no references in the medical literature to surgical removal of \ntesticles or amputation of the penis to stop masturbation (in boys)." 10 \n\nIn the United States, the last recorded clitoridectomy for curing \nmasturbation was performed in 1948 on a five-year-old girl. 11 \n\nThe Catholic church\'s definition of masturbation as "a grave \nmoral disorder" in 1976 may have incorporated fears of the effect of \nmasturbation on female orgasmic capacity, now well known to evolve \nthrough masturbatory experience the same as that of a male. 12 Less \nthan a century ago, in the Victorian era, priests and doctors realized that \n"the total repression of woman\'s sexuality was crucial to ensure her \nsubjugation." Leading authorities like Dr. Isaac Brown Baker per- \nformed many clitoridectomies to cure women\'s nervousness, hysteria, \ncatalepsy, insanity, female dementia, and other catchwords for symp- \ntoms of sexual frustration. 13 \n\nI.

Clytemnestra claimed a queen\'s traditional right to choose \nher consort, and have each new one slay the old one. Thus she arrangec \nto have her husband Agamemnon slain by her latest lover, Aegisthus, \nwhose name means Strong Goat. 1 \n\nAegisthus had the right mythic prerequisites for a sacred king. He \nwas born of an incestuous union. His mother Pelopia was a Goddess \nof Clytemnestra\'s clan, the Pelopids. In infancy he was abandoned to \nthe wild, was rescued, and, like Zeus himself, was nourished by a she- \ngoat. 2 He was prepared to be a god on earth. \n\nOrestes spoiled it by killing his mother and her lover, calling down \non himself the inexpiable curse of miasma for his matricide. The \nFuries pursued him, but the god Apollo defended him, on the ground \nthat motherhood was not real parenthood. "The mother is no parent \nof that which is called her child, but only nurse of the new-planted seed \nthat grows. The parent is he who mounts." 3 This Apollonian view of \nparenthood was also the Christian view, even subsequent to 1827 a.d. \nwhen Karl von Baer first discovered the human ovum, gigantic in \nsize and complexity as compared to a spermatozoon. \n\n1.

Actually, \nConstantine didn\'t do this in his own lifetime; his bishops did it \nafterward. Constantine was not so much a worshipper of Christ as he \nwas a worshipper of himself. \n\nConstantine considered himself the incarnation of "the supreme \ngod," a combination of Apollo, Mithra, Jupiter, the sun, and Christ. \nHe called himself "the instrument of the Deity." He said, "I banished \nand utterly abolished every form of evil then prevailing, in the hope \nthat the human race, enlightened through me, might be called to a \nproper observance of God\'s holy laws." He designated for his tomb a \nspot in the center of the cruciform Church of the Holy Apostles, saying \nhe would lie forever with six apostles at his left hand and six at his \nright. A contemporary historian said Constantine was "more greedy for \npraise than it is possible to tell." \' \n\nHe supported freedom of worship in his empire for the wrong \nreason: so that no god would be offended enough to take revenge on \nhim personally. He issued edicts of toleration for all religions, so that \n"we should give to Christians and to everyone else the right freely to \nfollow whatever religion they chose, so that, whatever divinity is \nenthroned in heaven may be well-disposed and propitious towards \nme." He tried to restrain Christian fanatics from persecuting pagans, \nJews, and heretics, writing in an encyclical letter to Bishop Eusebius \nof Nicomedia that these others must be "assured of the same degree of \npeace and tranquility" as orthodox Christians. 2 The orthodox Chris- \ntians did not agree, and soon after Constantine\'s death they instituted \nextensive persecutions and crusades extending over the next three \ncenturies. \n\n\n\n173 \n\n\n\nConstantine I Constantine did his best for the church. In one year he obtained \n\ntwelve thousand converts by the simple offer of a new garment and \n^ mm ^^^^^^m twenty gold pieces to each person who embraced the faith. 3 But he did \nas much for other cults too. He didn\'t become a Christian himself \nuntil the final weeks of his life, when he accepted baptism on his \ndeathbed, as insurance for his after-life. \n\nConstantine\'s life was hardly a model of piety. He murdered his \neldest son, his second wife, his father-in-law, his brother-in-law, and \n"many others," a chronicler said. His first wife, Minervina evidently a \npriestess of the Moon-goddess Minerva mysteriously disappeared. \nNo one knows what became of her. His second wife Fausta was his \nstepping-stone to the throne, according to the ancient rule of the \nhieros gamos. Eulogists at the wedding said, "The title of sovereignty \nhas now accrued to thee, O Constantine, through thy father-in- \nlaw." 4 There being no law of primogeniture, the throne still passed \nthrough the female line. \n\nTo eliminate a potential rival, Constantine killed his eldest son \nCrispus, born of the vanished Minervina. Afterward he accused \nFausta of having had a love affair with her now-deceased stepson, along \nwith other adulterous affairs, and killed her; it seems that any lover \nthe empress took was still a threat to the emperor\'s political position. 5 \n\nThe murdered Crispus might have played the role of savior and \nsacred king, for after his death he was virtually canonized as a \n"blessed martyr." Churches in Greece were dedicated to him for over a \nmillenium. "During the period of the Turkish occupation of Greece, \nover a thousand years later, he was still remembered as the Caesar, the \nhero-prince, the Christian Theseus, as it were, founder of the \nmodern Greek nation." 6 Yet Crispus was neither a Caesar nor a \nChristian. \n\nChristian bishops eventually convinced Constantine that their God \nwould forgive his crimes and enthrone him in heaven. When he felt \ndeath approaching, he said to them: "The salvation which I have \nearnestly desired of God these many years I do now expect. It is time \ntherefore that we should be sealed and signed in the badge of immortal- \nity." 7 So he was baptized, and died in the confident expectation of a \nglorious resurrection. \n\nHis literary whitewashing began at once. Despite his two wives and \nnumerous concubines, Christian panegyrists said he was "wedded to \nchastity." 8 Eusebius elevated all the emperor\'s doings into acts of piety, \nand invented the legend that Christ had converted him with a holy \nvision at the Milvian bridge. Later Christian legend claimed Constan- \ntine saw the sign of the cross in the sky, with the words in hoc signo \nvinces (in this sign conquer). However, the holy sign that Constantine \nplaced on his battle flags was not the cross. It was the labarum, a \nmonogram of Mithra and a sign of the sun, already in use by several \npagan emperors before Constantine. 9 \n\nAs an example of Constantine\'s Christian mercy, Cedrenus re- \n\n\n\n174 \n\n\n\ncorded that once when he was ill, he collected a number of children Convent \n\nto kill them and bathe in their blood as a healing charm. However, \n\nmoved by their mothers\' tears, the emperor spared the children\'s lives ^^^^^__^^_ \n\nafter all, and "the saints" restored his health as a reward for this act of \n\nmercy. 10 No one seemed inclined to criticize him for contemplating \n\nthe massacre in the first place. \n\nConstantine\'s luminous example showed that Christian magic \ncould prevent port-mortem punishment for a ruthless life. "Future \ntyrants were encouraged to believe," says Gibbon, "that the innocent \nblood which they might shed in a long reign would instantly be \nwashed away in the waters of regeneration; and the abuse of religion \ndangerously undermined the foundations of moral virtue." n \n\nChristianity served all the emperors after him, with the sole \nexception of Julian "the Apostate," much vilified by the church for \nsuspending the persecutions of pagans and trying to restore the culture \nof classical Rome. But Julian died young; some said he was assassinat- \ned by a Christian. 12 The war against paganism proceeded. Beginning \nabout 330 a.d., pagan shrines were looted and stripped of their gold, \nsilver, and bronze treasures, many of which were carried off to decorate \nConstantine\'s greatest monument to himself, the city of Constantino- \nple. 1? As Eusebius gleefully described the process: "The lurking-places \nof the heretics were broken up . . . and the savage beasts which they \nharbored were put to flight." H \n\nConstantine\'s edicts of toleration were rescinded after his death. \nThe new imperial religion attacked its rivals in a show of intolerance \non a grander scale than had ever been seen before. It was a great \nsuccess. "Forty years after the death of Constantine, the church had \nalready acquired a tenth of the whole of the landed property in Rome\'s \nwestern empire, a figure that in western Europe rose to a third during \nthe middle ages. . . . The church since the time of Constantine affords \nproof that it is not spiritual truth that has triumphed with the spread of \nChristianity but human power." 15 \n\nI. J.H.

Augstein, 299. \n\n\n\nConvent \n\nMedieval institution evolved from the pagan "college" of priestesses \nor virgines that is, unmarried women (not necessarily physical virgins) \ndedicated to divine service. \n\nEarly convents were double: a community of male monks united \nwith female priestesses under the rule of an abbess, usually a \nlandowning noblewoman. 1 "Priests and monks together with the nuns \ntook vows of obedience to the abbess in imitation of the obedience of \nJesus to his mother." A 10th-century Saxon chronicle speaks of double \n\n\n\n175 \n\n\n\nConvent convents inhabited by "priests of both sexes," although in a transla- \n\ntion it was revised to read, "priests of both orders." 2 \nm ^^^^^^^^^^ m As Christian laws encroached on women\'s property rights, many \n\nwomen of noble rank took vows to remain single, so as to protect \ntheir wealth from the claims of husbands. Thus originated the so-called \nconvent of noble ladies, an independent mini-queendom. For exam- \nple, the Saxon convent of Gandersheim in the 9th century held \noverlordship directly from the king. The abbess conducted her own \ncourts of law, kept her own seat in the imperial parliament, and \nmaintained her own standing army. 3 Culture and learning were \npursued. This convent trained the poetess Hrotswitha of Gandersheim, \ncalled "a Sappho, deserving to rank with the fabled Veleda and \nAurinia, ancient German poet-priestesses." 4 \n\nIn the 7th century, a papal bull confirmed the rights of freedom \nfrom taxation and from episcopal jurisdiction of the Parthenon of \nBeatae Mariae et Sanctae Columbae et Agathae (Virgin-house of \nBlessed Marys and Holy Doves and Kindly Ones). Abbesses of Las \nHuelgas ruled sixty towns, had the right to license bishops and priests \nwithin their dioceses, to confer benefices on clergy of their own \nchoice, to nominate ecclesiastical judges, to hear criminal cases among \ntheir subjects, and to establish new parishes. Bishops and apostolic \ndelegates were forbidden to visit churches, parishes, clergy, or beneficia- \nries in the abbess\'s territory. The nuns remained exempt from \nepiscopal jurisdiction all the way up to 1874. 5 \n\nAncient goddess-queens were described as "abbesses" in Christian \nhistories, to disguise the real nature of the pagan matriarchate that \nbacked them. Such a one was St. Odilia or Ottilia, called the abbess of \nOdilienberg (Hohenburg), a pilgrimage shrine of Alsace that was her \nown Holy Mountain. 6 Her legend had no documentary basis. 7 She was \nfraudulently canonized, only to attract her votaries to Christianity. \n\nMany abbesses retained their pagan title of High Priestess \nSacerdos Maxima especially in the German convents. At Quedlin- \nburg the abbess was "in control of the whole town, its people, churches, \nhospitals, clergy, canons and canonesses, and all religious orders." \nShe was not only High Priestess, but also Superior Canoness of the \nCathedral, Metropolitana (mayor), and Matricia (matriarch). At St. \nMary\'s Uberwasser in Munster, the abbess\'s title was Prima domna et \nmatre nostra spirituale, "Mistress-Leader and Our Spiritual Mother." \nCistercian monks at Las Huelgas swore obedience to the abbess as "the \nIllustrious Lady ... my Prelate, and my Lady, Superior, Mother and \nlegitimate administrator in spiritual and temporal affairs of the Royal \nMonastery and its Hospital." 8 \n\nSome centuries earlier, the Latin title of Sacerdos Maxima meant a \nhigh priestess of the Great Mother of the Gods. She was assisted by \nlesser priestesses known as ministra, "ministers." The word "sodality" \ncame from Latin sodales, a college of dancing priestesses trained in \nthe Great Mother\'s temple. 9 \n\n\n\n176 \n\n\n\nThat women in convents long retained the sexual freedom of the Convent \n\nancient priestesses is shown by interchangeable use of the words \n\n"convent" and "brothel" in medieval times. Nicholas Clemangis said ^^^^^^-^^ \n\nthe monasteries were not so much sanctuaries of God as they were \n"abodes of Venus." 10 \n\nThe word nun originally meant a nurse, that is, a priestess of a \nhealing shrine, like the "nymphs" in colleges of Hygeia and Panacea \nin pagan Greece. That the convents continued to function as hospitals \nis suggested by medieval romances: wounded, sick, or dying folk were \nusually cared for by "nuns." n The word also meant a virgin mother in \nGermanic paganism. A cognate was Nana, virgin mother of the god \nBalder. \n\nSometimes, pagan queens established convents in order to have \nthemselves canonized, just as Roman emperors were made gods by \nvirtue of their religious leadership. The canon of saints includes several \npagan queens whose only claim to beatitude was wealth, which \nbought the jurisdiction of an abbey and its subject lands. Some of the \nqueen-saints were even distinctly hostile to churchmen, like Queen \nBathild, foundress of a druidic convent at Chelles in the 7th century. \nShe was the real ruler of the western Franks, having placed her son \nChlotar on the throne. Certain bishops who tried to interfere with her \nwere assassinated. In the end she was "unceremoniously" removed \nfrom power by Christian nobles, and apparently murdered as a heretic, \nthough her subjects maintained her cult and called her Saint \nBathild. 12 \n\nIn Bede\'s time, Queen Ethelreda was ordained High Priestess of \nEly, and was succeeded by other supreme abbesses governing the \nmonastery\'s beatarum regimine feminarum (holy order of women) up \nto the Danish invasion in 866. The abbey of Wherwell was founded \nby Queen Elfrida in 986; it was exempt from earthly services, and held \nmany territories and churches. 13 \n\nAnother pagan princess who founded a convent in the 7th century \nand was canonized, was St. Wereburg of the royal house of Mercia, \nruler of the city of Chester. Her establishment was specifically for \n"noble women" refusing to give up their property to husbands. St. \nWereburg was canonized centuries later, on the strength of a legend \nthat her holy bones had extinguished the fires set in the city of \nChester by marauding Danes. 14 \n\nSt. Hild, or Hilda, of the royal house of Northumberland, estab- \nlished one of the most famous double monasteries of Anglo-Saxon \ntimes at Hartlepool, the "Isle of Stags." Her influence extended over all \nEngland. She created bishops and abbots, favoring especially the \npoet-missionaries of Celtic background. Bede said "all who knew her \ncalled her Mother." 15 Since she bore the name of the pagan Great \nMother Hild, or Hel, one might wonder about the real basis of her \nauthority, in a century when a majority of people had not yet heard of \nChristianity. 16 \n\n\n\n177 \n\n\n\nConvent Even when convents became Christianized, abbesses were still \n\nordained like bishops, and in some areas held more secular power than \n\n^^^^ Bi ^^^^ M bishops, though church histories have tried to conceal this, sometimes \nthrough deliberate falsification of the records. For instance, a papal bull \nsaid the abbess of the Cassian foundation in Marseilles was "or- \ndained"; a later editor changed the word to "blessed." At Jouarre, \nQuedlinburg, Conversano, and other places, an abbess held supreme \njurisdiction over both clergy and laity in her territory. According to the \nRule of St. Donatus, abbesses functioning as Matris Spirituale (Spiri- \ntual Mother) regularly heard confessions. French ecclesiastical records \nsay abbesses gave absolution by imposition of their hands on the \nheads of men. 17 \n\nThe church began to encroach on the rights of convents in the \n12th and 13th centuries, devising ways to appropriate the nuns\' \nproperty and make them subject to male clergy. At Fontevrault, \ncanonesses preceded the monks in processions, carried the pastoral \ncross, preached, read the Gospel, and heard confessions. Pope Innocent \nIII deprived them of these privileges. Disagreements arose between \nmale and female clergy. Monks insisted they would no longer genuflect \nevery time they passed the abbess. Nuns reacted by refusing to kneel \nin the confessional before their brothers. Innocent III also commanded \nthe abbess of Jouarre, her clergy, and her layfolk to subject them- \nselves to the authority of the bishop of Meaux. When the abbess asked \nfor time to prove her right to independence, she and all her \ncommunity were excommunicated. Decrees of the Council of Trent \nchanged church laws to say women\'s orders must be taken over and \nsupervised by men\'s orders. 18 \n\nConsiderable bitterness accompanied sexual segregation of the \ndouble convents, judging from the letter of Abbot Conrad of March- \ntal, on barring women from his order: \n\nWe and our whole community of canons, recognizing that the wickedness \nof women is greater than all other wickedness of the world, and there is \nno anger like that of women, and that the poison of asps and dragons is \nmore curable and less dangerous for men than the familiarity of \nwomen, have unanimously decreed for the safety of our souls, no less than \nfor that of our bodies and goods, that we will on no account receive any \nmore sisters to the increase of our perdition, but will avoid them like \npoisonous animals. ,9 \n\nConvents had been centers of higher learning for women in an \nage when women were forbidden access to schools and universities. \nEarlier in the medieval period, girls as well as boys attended ecclesias- \ntical schools in Ireland and learned to read and write; but this practice \nwas later forbidden, the schools being kept only for males. 20 Premon- \nstratensian and Cistercian orders were famed as educators of women, \nuntil the Council of Trent ruled that women\'s orders must be taken \nover by men\'s orders. 21 Then Cistercian nuns were forbidden to \nestablish any more teaching convents. 22 \n\nNuns were further commanded not to teach or discuss theological \n\n178 \n\n\n\nmatters. This was used as a device for outlawing their orders and Convent \n\nconfiscating their property. It served as an excuse for the Council of \n\nVienne to deprive the teaching nuns called Beguines of their lands \n\nand houses, in 1 3 1 2 when monks of the Inquisition demanded them: \n\nWe have been told that certain women commonly called Beguines, \nafflicted by a kind of madness, discuss the Holy Trinity and the divine \nessence, and express opinions on matters of faith and sacraments. \nSince these women promise no obedience to anyone and do not \nrenounce their property or profess an approved Rule . . . fw]e have there- \nfore decided and declared with the approval of the Council that their \nway of life is to be permanently forbidden and altogether excluded from \nthe Church of God. 2 * \n\nThe Beguines were forced to integrate into orders approved by \nthe pope, where they would receive no education. Their properties \nwere taken over by the Inquisition to provide dwellings and prisons \nfor the inquisitors\' use. 24 \n\nFrom the 1 2th century on, there was increasing pressure on \nconvents to adopt rules of close confinement, to keep nuns segregat- \ned from the outside world. The canonesses of St. Mary\'s Uberwasser \nrebelled three times against the imposition of the Benedictine Rule, \nwhich would force them into seclusion. 25 Many convents were threat- \nened with excommunication, dissolution, or even prosecution by the \nInquisition to force them to accept strict seclusion and to cease develop- \ning the sisters\' minds. \n\nEarly in the 17th century, teacher Mary Ward tried to found a \nCatholic order of teaching nuns known as the English Ladies, to \nprovide education for girls. She and her sisters refused to submit to the \ncloister, so Mary was arrested and accused of heresy. Her order was \nsuppressed in 1629. Pope Urban VIII rebuked them: "Certain women, \ntaking the name of Jesuitesses, assembled and living together, built \ncolleges, and appointed superiors and a General, assumed a peculiar \nhabit without the approbation of the Holy See . . . carried out works \nby no means suiting the weakness of their sex, womanly modesty, \nvirginal purity." 26 With typically patriarchal reasoning, the English \nLadies were punished for doing what women were supposed to be \nunable to do. \n\nA few convents managed to hold on to their pre-patriarchal \nindependence. The clergy failed to turn out the canonesses of St. \nWaudru, at Mons. Monks of Fontevrault likewise failed to take over the \nmain church or the nuns\' house, and were obliged to continue to vow \nobedience to the abbesses, up to the French Revolution. 27 \n\n1. Encyc.

Ravensdale & Morgan, 153. \n\n\n\nCow \n\nPerhaps the most common manifestation of the Great Mother as \nPreserver was the white, horned, milk-giving Moon-cow, still sacred in \nIndia as a symbol of Kali. Egypt revered Mother Hathor as the \nheavenly cow whose udder produced the Milky Way, whose body was \n\n\n\n180 \n\n\n\nthe firmament, and who daily gave birth to the sun, Horus-Ra, her \nGolden Calf, the same deity worshipped by Aaron and the Israelites: \n"These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land \nof Egypt" (Exodus 32:4). \n\nThe name of Italy meant "calf-land." ! This country too was the \ngift of the Milk-giver, whom Etruscans called Lat, Arabs called Al- \nLat, Greeks called Latona, Lada, Leto, or Leda. She ruled Latium, and \ngave her milk (Jatte) to the world. \n\nAll Europe was named after the Goddess as a white Moon-cow, \nwhom the Greeks mated to the white bull incarnation of Zeus. Her \nalternative name was Io, "Moon." Under this name she was presented \nin classic mythology as a rival of Hera, but patriarchal writers were \nalways setting different manifestations of the same Goddess at odds with \none another, possibly on the principle of divide and conquer. Hera \nherself was named Io, ancestress of the Ionians. In her temple on the \nsite of Byzantium she appeared as the same lunar cow, the Horned \nOne, wearing the same crescent headdress as the Egyptian Cow- \ngoddess. 2 \n\nThe Cow as creatress was equally prominent in myths of northern \nEurope, where she was named Audumla; she was also Freya, or a \nValkyrie taking the form of a "fierce cow." 6 A semi-patriarchal Norse \nmyth tried to attribute the creation of the world to the giant Ymir, \nwhose body and blood made the universe. But he was not the first of \ncreatures. The Cow preceded him, for he lived on her milk. 7 \n\nEarlier myths showed the universe being "curdled" into shape \nfrom the Cow\'s milk. In India, many still believe literally the creation \nmyth known as Churning of the Sea of Milk. 8 The Japanese version \nsaid the primordial deep went "curdlecurdle" (koworokoworo) when \nstirred by the first deities, to make clumps of land. 9 The ancient Near \nEast thought human bodies too were curdled from the Goddess\'s \nmilk. One of her liturgies was copied into the Bible: "Has thou not \npoured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?" (Job 10:10). \n\nThe root of "cow" was Sanskrit Gau, Egyptian kau or kau-t. \nGoddess-names like Gauri and Kauri also designated the yonic \ncowrie shell. 10 Brahman rebirth ceremonies used either a huge golden \nyoni or an image of the Cow-mother. "When a man has for grave \ncause been expelled from his caste, he may be restored to it after passing \nseveral times under the belly of a cow." u The Egyptian Goddess as \nbirth-giver typically wore a cow\'s head or horns, as she offered her \nbreasts with both hands. 12 As the nursing mother who gave each \nEgyptian his secret soul-name (re/7), she was entitled Renenet, the Lady \nof the Double Granary, a reference to her inexhaustible breasts. 13 \nThe bovine enzyme rennet, used even in antiquity to curdle milk, was \nalso sacred to her. \n\nA favorite Roman emblem of the Goddess was the Cornucopia, \nHorn of Plenty: a cow\'s horn pouring forth all the fruits of the earth. \nThe cow was honored as the wetnurse of humanity, and her image is \n\n\n\nCow \n\n\n\nHerodotus said the \nmilk-giving Mother \nHera-Io-Latona was \nthe same as Egypt\'s \nButo, "an archaic \nqueen of the Lower \nKingdom." 5 The \nholy city of Buto, \nEgypt\'s oldest \noracular shrine, was \nknown to the Greeks \nas Latopolis, "city of \nLat." 4 Of course \nButo, or Lat, was only \nanother name for \nHathor, or Isis, or Mut, \nor Neith; all \nrepresented "the great \ncow which gave birth \nto Ra, the great \ngoddess, the mother \nof all the gods ... the \nCow, the great lady, \nlady of the south, the \ngreat one who gave \nbirth to the sun, who \nmade the germ of \ngods and men, the \nmother of Ra, who \nraised up Tern in \nprimeval time, who \nexisted when nothing \nelse had being, and \nwho created that which \nexists." 5 \n\n\n\n181 \n\n\n\nCowrie still inadvertently invoked to this day as an expletive Holy Cow, or a \n\npejorative Sacred Cow. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ 1.

Skeletons from the \nSolutrean period, ca. 20,000 B.C., have been found "lavishly decorated \nwith cowrie shells." l \n\nEgyptians decorated sarcophagi with cowrie shells as a rebirth \ncharm. Cowries are still prized throughout the east for their supposed \nhealing and regenerative powers. Cowrie necklaces are valued in India \nas amulets against the evil eye. 2 Moslem women believe cowries \nshould be worn on the body during pregnancy. The Japanese keep \ncowries in wardrobe cabinets "for luck"; if no cowries are available, \npornographic pictures of female genitals serve as a substitute. 5 Gypsies \nvalued a cowrie above all other kinds of protective amulets. 4 Chris- \ntianized natives of the Sudan consider a strip of leather stamped with the \nsign of the cross a valuable amulet; but it is not "strong magic" unless \nnine cowrie shells are attached to it. 5 \n\nRomans called the cowrie shell matriculus, "little matrix," symbol \nof an Alma Mater (soul-mother) or teaching priestess, which is why a \nstudent still "matriculates" into instruction. The Roman Alma Mater \ntaught the philosophy of love as well as the love of philosophy. Unlike \nChristians, the pagans believed the capacity for heterosexual love \nrequired careful nurture and training. \n\nSometimes the Romans called a cowrie porcelk, "little sow," \nbecause it stood for the Goddess who was the Great Sow, like \nDemeter, Astarte, Ceres, Freya, Cerridwen, etc. From porcelk came \n"porcelain," so called because of its resemblance to the white glazed \nsurface of the shell. 6 A Greek word for the cowrie was kteis, which also \nmeant a scallop, a comb, and a vulva. 7 \n\nThe extreme antiquity of cowrie symbolism in the Middle East is \nshown by the ancestor-skulls preserved by the people of Jericho in the \n7th millenium b.c. These forerunners of the Jewish teraphim were \nsevered from the body, provided with features of painted plaster, and \nmade to "see" with the eyes of cowrie shells. 8 \n\nSpeaking of the Melanesians\' and Polynesians\' reverence for \ncowries, a missionary, Rev. George Brown, wrote, "There is some \nsacredness about them, but what it is, is not at all clear. The natives will \nnot talk about them at all." 9 It seems likely that the natives he \n\n\n\n182 \n\n\n\nnentioned had already become well aware that there was no use talking Crab \n\nabout sexual symbols to missionaries.

Condi- \ntions before creation suggest the uterine environment: darkness, liquid, \nstirring or churning movement, the "eternal flux" associated with the \nblood of the Mother (Kali\'s Ocean of Blood, for example). Often there \nis a suggestion of one entity inside another. "When there was neither \nthe creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, and \nwhen darkness was enveloped in Darkness, then the Mother, the \nFormless One, Maha-Kali, the Great Power, was one with Maha-Kala, \nthe Absolute." x \n\nThe Bible\'s highly derivative version says "the earth was without \nform, and void: and darkness was upon the face of the Deep" \n(Genesis 1:2). The Deep was the Mother\'s womb, tehom, derived from \nTiamat, the Babylonian name of the primordial Goddess. In Egypt, \nshe was Temu, mother of the abyssal elements: Water, Darkness, \nNight, and Eternity. 2 \n\nMost creation myths speak of a splitting or opening in the dark, \nformless Mother. The beginning of the existing world is signaled by \n\n\n\n183 \n\n\n\nCreation \n\n\n\nJean Astruc 1 8th- \ncentury French \nCatholic physician \nand scholar. \n\n\n\nthe coming of light. Romans made the connection with birth quite \nclear: Juno Lucina was not only a creatress, but also the Mother who \nbrought "light" to the eyes of the newborn. 3 The biblical God who said \n"Let there be light" (Fiat lux) copied the word of the Goddess. \n\nThe prominence given everywhere to that moment of light sug- \ngests archetypal memories of the first impact of light on newborn eyes \nwhich have never seen light before. Like dreams of the individual \nunconscious, myths of the collective unconscious reveal hidden \nmemories of the birth trauma. "Locked up in the depths of our \nunconscious mind is the terrific impact of birth, the violent adventure \nthat uprooted our pre-natal world." 4 It is also locked up in the symbol- \nism of myths, projected onto a cosmic scale. \n\nCreation/birth was inseparable from the figure of the Mother. The \noldest myths made her the divider of waters, maker of heaven and \nearth. When a god came into the picture, he was at first only her \nsubordinate consort, one of the beings she had created: sometimes a \ndisembodied phallus, in the form of a serpent. Late Egyptian gods who \nclaimed to be creators never succeeded in ridding themselves of \nfeminine imagery. For instance, Khepera insisted that he created the \nuniverse alone, "there was no other being who worked with me." Yet \nhe had to say, "I laid a foundation in Maa," meaning the Great Womb, \nthe Goddess Maat. 5 \n\nOften it is said when the god was allowed to create, he became \npuffed up with pride, and began to ignore his Mother and claim sole \nauthorship of the universe. This angered the Goddess. She punished \nhim, bruised his head with her heel, and sent him down to the \nunderworld. 6 (See Eve.) Sumerian creation myths said when the \nGoddess\'s son-spouse began to show signs of hubris she laid the curse \nof exile on him, saying, "Henceforth thou shalt dwell neither in heaven \nnor on earth." 7 This raises all kinds of questions about Middle- \nEastern sacrificial gods who died in expiation of a primal sin, hung on \ntrees or crosses "between heaven and earth." \n\nGnostic creation myths of the early Christian era were still telling \nversions in which the female principle was pre-eminent, which is why \nthey were declared uncanonical. "In his madness," Jehovah claimed to \nbe the only God, because he had forgotten the Mother who brought \nhim into being, according to one source. The Mother of Gods was \nangry that he had impiously sinned against her, and against her other \nchildren, the male and female Immortal Ones. These were the elohim \nof the Book of Genesis. God grouped himself with them, calling the \ngroup "us" (Genesis 3:22). But Bible revisions tended to erase earlier \ndeities, especially female ones. After the centuries of choosing and \nrevising canonical books, nearly every trace of female divinity had been \neliminated from Christian literature. 8 \n\nAs long ago as 1753, Astruc recognized that the Book of Genesis \n\n\n\n184 \n\n\n\ncontains at least two mutually contradictory versions of the creation Creation \nnyth. One version the scholars call E, for it speaks of plural creators, \n\nlohim, male and female deities. Another version is J, for Jehovah _^____^^^_ \n\ntlohim, the God of gods. The two versions disagree in many points: *^^^^^^^^ \n\nE: birds and beasts created before man. \nJ: man created before birds and beasts. \n\nE: birds made of water, along with fishes. \nJ: birds made of earth, along with beasts. \n\nE: man given dominion over the whole earth. \nJ: man placed only in the garden, "to dress it and keep it," like the \nmen created to be farmer-slaves in the Sumerian original. \n\nE: man and woman created together, after the beasts: "male and \nemale created he (they) them, and God (elohim, the deities) blessed \nhem." \n\nJ: man created alone, before beasts and birds; woman made from \nus rib. \n\nE: creation took place in six days. \nJ: creation took place in one day. \n\nE: nothing was said about the Fall, which appeared only in the \nnarrative. \n\nThe Fall was all-important. If it never took place, there was no \nmginal sin, no necessity for redemption, no Savior. Dean Burgon of \n\nhichester said to deny the literal truth of the Genesis story was to \n\'cause the entire scheme of man\'s salvation to collapse." Calvin stood \niquarely behind what he thought the Bible said, and insisted that all \npecies of animals were created at once, in a period of six normal days, \nach with a morning and evening, as stated. Those who disagree with \nlim, he said, "basely insult the Creator," and will meet after death "a \nudge who will annihilate them." 9 \n\nThe clergy\'s notion of investigating the origins of man consisted \n)f studying the Bible to add up the given ages of patriarchs since Adam. \nThis had been done in the 7th century by Isidore of Seville, who \n:ame up with a strange Bible-based view of history: "Joseph lived 105 \n/ears. Greece began to cultivate grain. The Jews were in slavery in \nEgypt 144 years. Atlas discovered astrology. Joshua ruled for 27 years. \nErichthonius yoked horses together. Othniel, 40 years. Cadmus \nntroduced letters into Greece. Deborah, 40 years. Apollo discovered \nhe art of medicine and invented the cithara. Gideon, 40 years. Mercury \nnvented the lyre and gave it to Orpheus." Reasoning on this level \nind never noticing anything odd about the many consecutive reigns of \nK) years Archbishop Usher in 1650 placed the date of creation in \nK)04 b.c. Dr. John Lightfoot, 19th-century Vice-Chancellor of the \n\n\n\n185 \n\n\n\nCreiddylad \n\n\n\nNicolas \n\nMalebranche (1638- \n1715) French \nmetaphysician who \nattempted to \nreconcile Cartesian \nphilosophy with \nCatholic doctrine. \n\n\n\nUniversity of Cambridge, carried the calculations even further: "Man \nwas created by the Trinity on the twenty-third of October, 4004 B.C., a \nnine o\'clock in the morning." 10 \n\nThe absurdity of such reasoning began to be exposed in 1830 \nwhen Sir Charles Lyell\'s Principles of Geology investigated the earth\'s \nlong-term changes, showing that creation could not have taken place ii \nsix days, nor in six years, nor even six thousand years. Geologists were \nfinding fossils of animals that lived millions of years ago. Bones of \nextinct species were found in caves, mingled with human bones. \nArcheologists found high civilization flourishing in Egypt in 6000 B.C., \nwith evidence of vastly older savage periods. Cuneiform writings \nshowed that the people of Mesopotamia were telling the same story of \ncreation that the Bible told and telling it thousands of years earlier. \n\nChristian scholars tried hard to refute the new findings. Gosse\'s \nOmphalos claimed all fossils, marks of retreating glaciers, lava flows, \nsedimentary rock strata, etc., were created instantaneously by God witl \nan appearance of pre-existence. Chateaubriand said God deliberately \nfooled men with the false appearance of pre-existence in order to test \ntheir faith. Others tried to explain fossils by calling them God\'s \ndeceptions, formed of "lapidific juice" or "seminal air." u \n\nNaturally these crude views had to be abandoned in the end. \nUpholders of the Bible then tried to call the Genesis creation myth \nallegorical, with each "day" corresponding to a large span of prehistori \ntime. This didn\'t work either. The Bible brought plants into being \nbefore the sun, on which plant life depends; made fish and birds befon \n"creeping things" on land which was hardly the case; and produced \n"light" before the only sources of light, sun and moon. \n\nHowever absurd, these myths still maintain a hold on vast numb( \nof people deliberately kept in ignorance by an obsolete fundamentalisr \nEven educated adults sometimes insist that an omniscient god created \nthe world for a purpose of his own. 12 Malebranche came up with an \noriginal notion, which may have helped the public image of his churcl \nbut made his God look rather less than grand. He said God "can love \nonly Himself and therefore act only with the ultimate purpose of \n\nincreasing His glory Thus the sole purpose of the creation was the \n\nincarnation and the formation of the Church." n \n\nI. de Riencourt, 165. 2.

See Gwyn. \n\n\n\n186 \n\n\n\nCrispin, Saint Crispin, Saint \n\nRoman tutelary god of shoemakers, transformed into a saint by a Cronus \n\n"very late and quite worthless" legend. > October 2 5 , the day of the ^^^aiHHi \n\nshoemakers\' feast among the pagans, was adopted as St. Crispin\'s \nDay. 2 He is still the patron of shoemakers, and his symbol is a shoe. \n\n1. Attwater, 94. 2. de Lys, 182. \n\n\n\nCrone \n\nGeneral designation of the third of the Triple Goddess\'s three \naspects, exemplified by such figures as Kali the Destroyer, Cerridwen \nthe death-dealing Sow, Atropos the Cutter, Macha, Hecate, Hel, \nEresh-Kigal, Morgan, Queen of the Ghostworld, Queen of the Under- \nworld, Queen of the Shades, Persephone "the Destroyer," etc. All \nsuch forms represented old age or death, winter, doomsday, the waning \nmoon, and other symbols of the inevitable destruction or dissolution \nthat must precede regeneration. \n\nThe "Crone" may have descended from Rhea Kronia as Mother \nof Time, though the title has been linked with Coronis, the carrion \ncrow, since crows and other black creatures were sacred to the Death- \ngoddess. Her fearsome character often had a "virgin mother" side as \nwell, because her trinity of appearances was cyclic. It was said in the \nEast that true lovers of the Goddess must love her ugly "destroyer" \nimages as well as her beautiful ones. The Crone also represented the \nthird (post-menopausal) phase of women\'s lives, and her shrines were \nserved by priestesses in this stage of life. Because it was believed that \nwomen became very wise when they no longer shed the lunar "wise \nblood" but kept it within, the Crone was usually a Goddess of Wisdom. \nMinerva, Athene, Metis, Sophia, and Medusa provide typical \nexamples. \n\n\n\nCronus \n\nTitan god who castrated his father Uranus (Heaven) and was in turn \ndeposed by his own son Zeus. Knowing the danger his children posed, \nCronus tried to prevent it by swallowing them all an early version \nof the Slaughter of the Innocents but Zeus escaped. Cronus was \nconfused with Chronos, "Time," because Time swallows up every- \nthing it brings forth actually a characteristic of Cronus\'s mother-mate, \nRhea Kronia, the Goddess personifying time and fate. She was really \nMother Earth, who gave birth to Cronus; and Rhea, who married him; \nand Hera, who married his son Zeus; the three of them comparable \nto the Mother, Grandmother, and Great-grandmother Goddesses in \nnorthern Europe. 1 See Caste. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,37-40. \n\n\n\n187 \n\n\n\n\nCross Cross \n\nThe "Latin" or "Passion" cross, now the primary symbol of Chris- \n^^^^^^^^^ tianity, was not shown in Christian art until six centuries after Christ. 1 \nBut long before the Christian era it was a pagan religious symbol \nthroughout Europe and western Asia. 2 Early Christians even repudiatec \nthe cross because it was pagan. A church father of the 3rd century, \n\n+ Minucius Felix, indignantly denied that Christians worshipped the \n\ncross: "You it is, ye Pagans, who are the most likely people to adore \nwooden crosses ... for what else are your ensigns, flags, and standards, \nbut crosses gilt and beautiful. Your victorious trophies not only \nrepresent a simple cross, but a cross with a man on it." ? \n\nFrom very ancient times, an effigy of a man hanging on a cross \n\nLatin Cross was set up in fields to protect the crops. The modern scarecrow is a \n\nsurvival of this sacrificial magic, representing the sacred king whose \nblood was supposed to fertilize the earth. He was never abandoned, \neven though every farmer knew that no scarecrow ever really scared a \ncrow. 4 \n\nThe cross was also a male symbol of the phallic Tree of Life; \ntherefore it often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital \ncircle or oval, to signify the sacred marriage. Male cross and female orb \ncomposed the Egyptian "amulet Nefer," or amulet of blessedness, a \ncharm of sexual harmony. 5 \n\nThe so-called Celtic cross, with the crossing of the arms encircled \nby a ring, was another lingam-yoni sign of sexual union, known to the \n\nHindus as Kiakra. 6 Some old Celtic crosses still in existence show \n\nCeltic Cross obvious phallic elements, even to a realistic meatus at the cross\'s tip. 7 \n\nCrosses signified a god\'s love-death even in pre-Columbian art of the \nwestern hemisphere, which showed the Savior carrying his cross, an \nimage very similar to the Christian one. 8 \n\nNo one knows exactly when the cross became associated with \nChristianity. Early images of Jesus represented him not on a cross, \nbut in the guise of the Osirian or Hermetic "Good Shepherd," carrying \n\n+ a lamb. Later, many different kinds of crosses were used as Christian \n\nsymbols. They included the Greek cross of equal arms, the X-shaped St \nAndrew\'s cross, the swastika, the Gnostic Maltese cross, the solar \ncross or Cross of Wotan, and the ansated cross, a development of the \nEgyptian ankh, also found as the Cross of Venus. 9 \n\nGreeks said this cross was "common to the worship of Christ and \n\nGreek Cross Sarapis." 10 The Goddess Isis is shown on the Isiac Table with the \n\ncross in one hand, a lotus seed-vessel in the other, signifying male and \nfemale genitalia. 11 As her consort, the god Sarapis was incarnate in \nPtolemy. The words "Ptolemy the Savior" were followed by a cross on \nthe Damietta Stone. Pious Christian scholars once tried to pretend \nthat this phrase was really a prophecy of the future Christ. 12 \n\nFor a few centuries the emblem of Christ was a headless T-shaped \nTau cross rather than a Latin cross. This may have been copied from \npagan druids, who made Tau crosses of oak trees stripped of their \n\n\n\n188 \n\n\n\nT \n\n\n\nbranches, with two large limbs fastened at the top to represent a Cross \n\nman\'s arms. This was the Thau, or god. 13 \n\nA Tau cross was the sign of the holy day aptly named the ^^^^^^^^ \n\nInvention of the Cross, purporting to commemorate the discovery of \nthe True Cross by the empress Helena, mother of Constantine, in a \ncrypt under the temple of Aphrodite in Jerusalem. 14 After it was \ngenerally replaced by the Latin cross, the Tau cross was reassigned to \nSt. Philip, supposedly crucified on a Tau cross in Phrygia, where he \nwas trying to exorcise the god Mars in the form of a dragon. 15 This \nmeans the Tau cross was the sign of May Day, which the church \nadopted as St. Philip\'s day; and the druidic Thau was confused with the \nMaypole. \n\nThe Invention of the Cross was first heard of long after the lifetime Tau Cross \nof the empress Helena. The date assigned to her "discovery" was \n328 a.d., though no contemporary chronicler thought fit to mention \nsuch a momentous event. The legend said Helena found three \ncrosses under Aphrodite\'s temple, but couldn\'t decide which belonged \nto Christ, which to the two thieves. She had a corpse brought, and \nlaid on each cross in turn. When laid on the right one, the dead man \nsprang up alive. According to an alternative story, the True Cross \ninstantly restored the health of "a noble lady who was near to death." 16 \n\nChristian authorities also claimed the empress found the Holy \nNails and the INRI scroll, but the latter somehow disappeared and \nwas lost for over a thousand years. In 1492 it was miraculously \nrediscovered in the Church of the Holy Cross in Rome, where it \nseemed to have been all the time. Pope Alexander III published a bull \ninfallibly attesting to its authenticity. 17 \n\nThe Invention of the Cross proved enormously useful in the \nMiddle Ages, to account for the veritable forest of splinters of the \nTrue Cross revered in Europe\'s churches. There was so much miracle- \nworking wood of the True Cross that Calvin said it would make "a \nfull load for a good ship." 18 \n\nThe church claimed the True Cross was made of the same wood \nthat grew as the Tree of Life in the garden of Eden. It was carried out \nby Adam, and preserved by all the patriarchs in turn (even riding the \nFlood in Noah\'s ark), for the sole purpose of crucifying the Savior \nwhen he appeared. Gnostic sources added an Oedipal twist: Jesus\'s cross \nwas put together by his father, Joseph the carpenter. Moreover, the \ncross was planted on the very spot where the Tree of Life once grew. \nThe church said it became "the Tree of the Cross, so that whence \ncame death, thence also life might rise again." These absurdities were \nimplicitly believed through the Middle Ages. 19 \n\nMale genitals are still called "the tree of life" by the Arabs, and a \ncross was one of the oldest diagrammatic images of male genitals. \nAmong Christians there was at least some recognition of the cross\'s \nphallic significance. An ancient crucifix at Sancreed in Cornwall was \na spear set upright in a holy vase (the uterine vessel) with two testicle- \n\n\n\n189 \n\n\n\nCrossroads like scrolls appended to its shaft. 20 The cross entering the labyrinth \n\nwas one of the oldest symbols of the lingam-yoni in the west, dating \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^_ back to early Neolithic times. Spiral "feminine" labyrinths penetrated \n\nby a cross occur in prehistoric rock carvings from Crete, at Tintagel in \n\nCornwall, Wier Island in Finland, and Chartres Cathedral. 21 \n\nConscious or not, the phallic connotations of the cross appear even \n\nin the present century. In the 1950\'s a poem in the magazine Wake \n\nsaid: "Christ, I have walked around your erection, The Cross, that \n\nbegot, upon a sky of prayer, a billion men, devoted in humility." 22 \n\nDuring the so-called Age of Faith, the peasants were perhaps not \n\nso devoted in humility to the cross as churchmen wanted. Certain \n\nbrotherhoods of "accursed huntsmen" or "archer wizards" constantly \n\ndefaced roadside crosses, believing they could acquire magic skill with \n\nthe bow by shooting three arrows in succession at a crucifix. 2 * Thus they \n\nopposed the phallic trident of the ancient Lord of the Hunt to \n\nChrist\'s symbol. (See Trident.) Today, the cross is often an article of \n\njewelry, attesting an amuletic function virtually indistinguishable \n\nfrom its magical prophylactic use in antiquity. \n\n1. H.

Kramer & Sprenger, 1 50. \n\n\n\nCrossroads \n\nIn the Greco-Roman world, crossroads were sacred to the elder \nDiana under the name of Hecate Trevia (Hecate of the Three Ways), \nmother of the Lares compitales, "spirits of the crossroads." Travelers \nmade offerings to the Goddess\'s three-faced images, and regular festivals \ncalled Compitalia were celebrated at her roadside shrines. 1 \n\nFour-way crossroads were sometimes dedicated to Hermes, whose \nithyphallic herms stood beside them until replaced by Christians\' \nroadside crosses. However, the Christian sign of the cross was copied \nfrom Hermes\'s cult and traced his sacred numeral 4 on the worship- \nper\'s head and breast. Hermetic crosses were left at the crossroads of \n10th-century Ireland and simply re-interpreted as Christian symbols, \nthough they plainly displayed the twin serpents of the pagan caduceus, \nanother sign of the older deity. 2 \n\nCross, herm, and caduceus merged in northern symbolism with \nthe gallows tree of Odin/ Wotan, "God of the Hanged," which led to \nthe Christian custom of erecting a gallows at crossroads as well as a \ncrucifix. The god on the gallows once played the same role as Jesus \non the cross: a dying-god image rendered the crossroad numinous. Pre- \nChristian Europeans held waymeets, or moots, at crossroads to \ninvoke their deities\' attention to the proceedings; hence a moot point \n\n\n\n190 \n\n\n\nused to be one to be decided at a meet. The Goddess as Mother \nEarth, dispenser of "natural law" and creatress of birth-and-death \ncycles, was always present where the dying god died as the women \nlong remembered. The English monk Aelfric complained of female \ncustoms dedicating newborn infants to the ancient Mother. Women \nwould "go to the crossways and drag their children over the earth, and \nthereby give both themselves and their children to the Devil." 3 \n\nAs the crossroad ceremonies and their deities became diabolized, \nthe Goddess of the waymeet became the queen of witches, who still \nworked magic there. The Key of Solomon said crossroads were the best \nof all places for magical procedures "during the depth and silence of \nthe night." 4 Ghosts of the hanged, of the heathen, and of ancient \naracles still haunted crossroads. Bernard Ragner said a spirit voice \nwould foretell the future to anyone who went to a crossroad at the last \nhour of Christmas Eve. As late as the 1920\'s, English farmers still \nrelieved witches\' sabbats were held at crossroads. Necromantic supersti- \n:ions were encouraged by the custom of burying criminals and \nsuicides in unhallowed ground at crossroads; clergymen said anyone so \njuried would walk as a ghost. Sometimes, such corpses were pinned \ndown with a stake: "A stake was driven through them when deposited at \n:he cross-roads in order to keep the ghost from wandering abroad." 5 \nPresumably, the ghost could be consulted in situ, just as spirits could be \naised from their graves in the churchyard by any necromancer. \n\nThus Hermes and Hecate, who led the souls of the dead in \nantiquity, became dread spirits of "witchcraft" in the same places that \nhey once benevolently ruled. \n\n\n\nCrow \n\n\n\n1.

Wedeck, 153. \n\n\n\nCrow \n\n\\long with the vulture and raven, the carrion-eating crow was \nborthern Europe\'s common symbol of the Death-goddess. Valkyries, \npometimes described as man-eating women, often took totemic form \nas ravens or crows. 1 \n\nAnglo-Danish myths spoke of a witch named Krake (Crow), \ndaughter of the Valkyrie Brunnhilde. Krake was a shape-shifter: at \n:imes a beautiful virgin, at other times a hag, monster, or crow. She \nnamed the Danish king Ragnar Lodbrok (Leather-Breeches), and \njave birth to the hero Sigurd. 2 Sigurd was the same as Siegfried, whose \nnystic lady-love was the Valkyrie Brunnhilde; thus appeared the \name convoluted incestuous relationships found in the oldest myths of \nacred kingship. Again, the Triple Goddess returned as the three \nirophetic daughters of Ragnar and Krake, Fate-weavers who created \nhe magic banner called Raven (Hraefn). 3 \n\nThere was a mythological Kraken associated with the sea, pictured \nis a serpent or water-monster; but this was only another form of the \n\n\n\nKey of Solomon \n\n(Clavicule de Salomon) \nA popular "Black \nBook" or magic book \nmuch used between the \n11th and Bthcentu- \n\n\n\nBernard Ragner \n\nAuthor of Legends and \nCustoms of Christmas, \n1925 \n\n\n\n191 \n\n\n\nCrusades same Death-goddess. The Three Ravens (Kraken) in old ballads were \n\nbirds of doom perching over the slain hero. Sometimes there were \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ m only two of them, as in the ballad of the Twa Corbies (Two Crows), \nwho proposed to pluck out the bonny blue eyes of the slain knight. 4 \n\nSuch manifestations of the Goddess as a crow might be linked wit \nCoronis, "Crow," a death aspect of the pre-Hellenic earth mother \nRhea. Classical mythographers tended to ignore Coronis, rememberinj \nher only as the virgin mother of the healing god Asclepius; but she \nseems to have been another of the Virgin-Crone combinations: Rhea \nKronia as Mother Time who brings death to all things. 5 \n\n1 .

Graves, GM. 1, 175; 2, 387. \n\n\n\nCrusades \n\n"Holy wars" designed to wrest property away from the heathen or \nheretic enemies of orthodox Christianity. Crusades were usually fough \nby vassals of Christian overlords, including the wealthy clergy. War- \nriors were promised not only the standard soldiers\' spoils, but also \nindulgences, like instant remission of sins and admission to heaven \nguaranteed no matter what crimes the crusader may have committed. \n\nFrom the 8th to 10th centuries, the Holy Roman Empire was \nharassed by Norsemen, who owned many northern trading centers \nand dominated the seas. They also opened negotiations with foreign \npowers in North Africa and the Middle East. In 834, Arabian legates \nvisited Denmark to contract military and trade alliances. 1 The Holy \nRoman Empire saw itself trapped between two anti-Christian forces: \nthe pagan Normans in the northwest, and the Moslem Saracens in the \nsoutheast. Norsemen controlled trade routes through the Danube \nand Black Sea to the Turks, and were acquiring hoards of Arabic silver \ngold, and gems. They also sailed the Atlantic coasts down to Gibral- \ntar, and founded colonies in Libya. The Kingdom of God was nearly \nencircled. \n\nPope Urban II tried to solve the problem by initiating crusades in \nthe east, on the pretext of converting the Saracens\' possessions in the \n"Holy Land" into Christian fiefs. In 1095 he instigated the People\'s \nCrusade as a combination of penitential pilgrimage and a war of \nconquest. It was advertised throughout Europe. All who participated \nwere placed above restrictions of law, and promised forgiveness of \nsins and eternal bliss in heaven without any time spent in purgatory. \n\nA rabble of some 1 50,000 to 300,000 persons, mostly the dregs c \nsociety mixed with military mercenaries, set out across southern \nEurope, killing, torturing, and looting as they went. One division \nslaughtered 10,000 Jews in the Rhineland, then forgot about the \nHoly Land and dispersed. Two other divisions did so much harm in \nHungary that native soldiers rose up against them and destroyed \nthem all. Multitudes died along the way, of sickness, hunger, or injurie \n\n\n\n192 \n\n\n\n\nbrought on by their violence. A remnant survived to plunder the too- Crusades \n\nhospitable Greeks, then to enter Constantinople. There, stronger \n\ncrusaders sold off the weaker ones as slaves, to finance their own ^^^^^_^_^_ \n\nprovisions. Finally, a remaining 7,000 or so crossed the Bosporus and \n\nwere attacked by the Turks, who soon killed them all. 2 \n\nOne might think the fate of Pope Urban\'s crusade would have \ndiscouraged future experiments of this kind. Not so. It seems to have \nbeen an idea whose time had come. \n\nLater crusades were better organized, with more experienced \nsoldiers and fewer penitential pilgrims. Their primary motive was \nloot. For the next 400 years, Christian knights went forth to astonish the \nSaracens with their intellectual naYvete and their military sophistica- \ntion, developed in a feudal society based on warfare. \n\nThe Crusaders in general, in spite of their sacred cause, behaved like \nhighway robbers. The first host which set out in 1095, and was \nannihilated by the Turks at Nicaea, killed, burned and pillaged all they \nencountered. The army commanded by Godfrey de Bouillon massa- \ncred the entire population of Jerusalem (1098). The astuteness of Venice \nturned aside the fourth Crusade upon Constantinople, and the sack of \nthis city is a dark blot on the history of Western Christendom (1204). It \nwas abominably ravaged, and the very church of St. Sophia was the \nscene of bloody and sacrilegious orgies. * \n\nA contemporary chronicler said Jerusalem withstood a month\'s \nsiege. Upon its fall, crusaders rode into the city with their horses wading \n"knee-deep in the blood of disbelievers." Jews were herded into their \nsynagogues and burned alive. On the next day, the knights slaughtered \n"a great multitude of people of every age, old men and women, \nmaidens, children and mothers with infants, by way of a solemn \nsacrifice" to Jesus. 4 At the battle of Acre, Richard Coeur de Lion \nviolated his pledge of truce, and had his hostages slaughtered and flayed. \n"His conduct stands in strong contrast with the dignity and forbear- \nance of Saladin, before whose eyes the outrage was committed, and who \nwould not stoop to retaliate on his dastardly opponent." 5 \n\nOnce the crusading system was established, it was turned on other \nenemies of the church closer to home and became the standard \nmethod for dealing with European heathens and heretics. Between \n1236 and 1283 a crusade of extermination was preached against the \npagan Prussians by Pope Honorius, and carried out by the Teutonic \nKnights. The Christian Brethren of the Sword similarly converted \nLivonia and Courland. Armies of the Christian Dukes of Poland forced \nthe Wends to accept Christian baptism and vassalage. The Lithua- \nnians stubbornly clung to their paganism to the end of the 14th century, \nbut eventually they too were Christianized by the sword. 6 \n\nIt was noticed in the 1 3th century that the semi-barbarous Ste- \ndingers of the lower Weser river maintained their ancient tribal \nsystem, paid no attention to the church, and contributed no tithes. Pope \nGregory IX sent bulls to the bishops of Minden, Lubeck, and \n\n\n\n193 \n\n\n\nCrusades Verden, ordering crusades against these recalcitrant peasants, whom he \n\ndescribed as heretics because they consulted wise-women, made \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ waxen images, and worshipped "demons." Crusaders were promised \nblanket pardon for their sins. However, the Stedingers fought back \nstubbornly, and several campaigns against them failed. At last in 1234 a \nhuge army marched into their land, ravaged every home with fire and \nsword, and wiped them out. Their property was divided between the \nchurch and the barons. 7 \n\nIt has been estimated that Europe was Christianized at a cost of \nabout 8 million to 10 million lives. 8 Even after nominal conversion, \nthere was much residual resistance to the new cult, which was alien and \nunappealing to the people it was imposed on. The clergy claimed \nauthority from an unfamiliar eastern savior and his God, defaming all \nthe pagans\' local, ancestral deities many worshipped since the \nNeolithic age as demons. Moreover, familiar laws and lifestyle were \ndeclared wholly sinful. It\'s hardly surprising that there arose heresy \nafter heresy to confront the conquering church, which became increas- \ningly fanatical in its dictatorial policies, yet in the end failed to \novercome the people\'s need to assert their own religious heterodoxy. 9 \nMany refused to give up their pagan Goddess, or their notion that \nsexuality contained an element of the divine. Many remembered a time, \nnot so long before, when "holy communion" was a taste of divine \nbliss through sensual pleasures: an idea that was especially prevalent in \nthe south of France. \n\nCrusades against the Catharan or Albigensian heretics of southern \nFrance were particularly virulent, since these people were prosperous \nenough to attract plunderers, and bitterly opposed to the Roman \nchurch, which they called the Synagogue of Satan. They condemned \nits worship of holy images as idolatry, denied the power of its sacra- \nments, scoffed at the Trinity, insisted on reading the Bible for \nthemselves, and revived the old Gnostic belief that the Jehovah wor- \nshipped by the Roman church was a demonic demiurge who created \nthe world of matter to entrap souls in wickedness. Pope Alexander III \nanathematized the Catharan communities and sent ecclesiastical \njudges to investigate their offenses in 1 163. Of these judges, the word \n"inquisitor" was used for the first time. 10 \n\nIn 1209 Pope Innocent II preached a great crusade against the \nFrench rebels. This has gone down in history as the Albigensian \ncrusade, one of the bloodiest chapters in Christianity\'s past. 11 Half of \nFrance was exterminated. When the papal legate was asked how \nheretics were to be distinguished from the faithful, he replied, "Kill \nthem all; God will know his own." 12 \n\nSoon the legate was able to report that in Beziers alone, "nearly \ntwenty thousand human beings perished by the sword. And after the \nmassacre the town was plundered and burnt, and the revenge of God \nseemed to rage over it in a wonderful manner." The killing of \nheretics went on continually for twenty years, and it has been estimated \nthat more than a million were slaughtered. 13 \n\n194 \n\n\n\nThis was more than a police action against heresy. It was the Cu Chulainn \ndestruction of a whole civilization that had the misfortune to be more \nadvanced than the rest of Europe. \n\nIn the twelfth century, the south of France had been the most civilized \nland in Europe. There commerce, industry, art, science, had been far \nin advance of the age. The cities had won virtual self-government, were \nproud of their wealth and strength, jealous of their liberties, and self- \nsacrificing in their patriotism. The nobles, for the most part, were \ncultivated men, poets themselves or patrons of poetry, who had learned \nthat their prosperity depended on the prosperity of their subjects, and that \nmunicipal liberties were a safeguard rather than a menace to the wise \nruler. The Crusaders came, and their unfinished work was taken up and \nexecuted to the bitter end by the Inquisition. It left a ruined and \nimpoverished country, with shattered industries and a failing commerce. \nThe native nobles were broken by confiscation and replaced by \nstrangers A people of rare gifts had been tortured, decimated, humili- \nated, despoiled. . . . The precocious civilization which had promised to \nlead Europe in the path of culture was gone, and to Italy was transmitted \nthe honour of the Renaissance. H \n\nCatholic writers made many efforts to justify the destruction. \n\nApologists like Pierre des Vaux-de-Cernay used vituperation, calling the \n\nCatharan opinions "this detestable pest ... the poison of superstitious \n\ninfidelity." He said Toulouse was "marvelously and miserably infected \n\nwith this plague . . . almost all the barons of Provence had become \n\nharborers and defenders of heretics." In the 19th century, Abbe \n\nVacandard said, "The Church, after all, was only defending herself. \n\nThe Cathari sought to wound her mortally by attacking her doctrine, \n\nher hierarchy and her apostolicity. She would have been ruined if \n\ntheir perfidious insinuations, which brought violent disturbance into \n\nmen\'s minds, had prevailed in the end." 15 It has ever been the \n\nchurch\'s habit to regard any skepticism concerning its pronouncements \n\nas "violent disturbance"; but of course, all the bloodletting was in \n\nvain. Skepticism did prevail in the end. \n\n1.0xenstierna,76. 2. H. Smith, 252-53. 3. Reinach, 295. 4. H. Smith, 253. \n\n5. Briffault 3, 392. 6. Reinach, 294. 7. Lea unabridged, 656-60. 8. H.

Their idols were \n\nsometimes interpreted as images of St. Sebastian, now officially \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^_ viewed as an over-hasty canonization of a Gaulish heathen savior. 2 \n\nCu Chulainn received his education in battle skills from Skadi, or \nScatha, the same northern death-goddess as the Queen of Skye. His \ndestiny or "weird" was to kill his rival on the "precursor day of spring," \nso the shedding of blood would "allow spring to enter." 3 The same \nidea of bloodshed to facilitate the return of spring is found in Teutonic \nmyths of Skadi. 4 \n\nCu means "dog," a common title of Celtic chieftains (as in \nCunobelin) identified with the underworld Lord of Death. Like \nEgypt\'s Anubis, the dead hero might become the canine gatekeeper \ncharged with admitting souls to paradise, as shown on the Gundes- \ntrup Cauldron. 5 The dog represented reincarnation. So did Cu \nChulainn, who was promised that "his rebirth would be of himself." \nHe was sent to Emania, the realm of the dead in the moon. 6 He may \nhave been the original of the British legend that the man in the moon \nis really a dog, who acts as a messenger of death. 7 \n\nThe virgin mother of Cu Chulainn conceived him by eating his \nsoul in the form of a fly. This Celtic soul-symbol originated in the \nMiddle East, where the Lord of Death was Baal-Zebub (Beelzebub), \nLord of Flies. Like most pagan gods, Cu Chulainn was a shape- \nshifter. He could be an insect, animal, or man at different stages in his \nlife cycle. Such changes from one shape to another were based on the \nancient Indo-European idea of metempsychosis. The Protean hero \neven adapted his shape to Christianity; the medieval Irish insisted that \nhe was an avatar of Christ. 8 \n\nLater Irish writers pretended that Cu Chulainn was not ignomini- \nously trussed up to his pillar as a sacrifice, in the manner of the old \ngods. They thought it important to prove that he fell in battle. There- \nfore they invented the legend that, wounded and knowing himself \ndoomed, Cu Chulainn tied himself to the sacred pillar so he couldn\'t \nfall down before his enemies, who were piercing him with arrows, but \nrather "died with his honor unimpaired." 9 \n\nl.Rees,235. 2.

A 16th-century writer \ntherefore described the cuckold as "cornute," that is, "as soundly \narmed for the head, as either Capricorn, or the stoutest horned sign in \nthe Zodiac." 3 See Horns. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 80. 2. Frazer, G.B., 142. 3. Hazlitt, 160. \n\n\n\nCunt \n\nDerivative of the Oriental Great Goddess as Cunti, or Kunda, the \nYoni of the Uni-verse. 1 From the same root came county, kin, and kind \n(Old English cyn, Gothic kuni). Related forms were Latin cunnus, \nMiddle English cunte, Old Norse and Frisian kunta, Basque cuna. \nOther cognates are "cunabula," a cradle, or earliest abode; "Cun- \nina," a Roman Goddess who protected children in the cradle; \n"cunctipotent," all-powerful (i.e., having cunt-magic); "cunicle," a \nhole or passage; "cuniculate," penetrated by a passage; "cundy," a \ncoverted culvert; also cunning, kenning, and ken: knowledge, learn- \ning, insight, remembrance, wisdom. Cunt is "not slang, dialect or any \nmarginal form, but a true language word, and of the oldest stock." 2 \n\n"Kin" meant not only matrilineal blood relations, but also a cleft or \ncrevice, the Goddess\'s genital opening. A Saharan tribe called Kun- \ntahs traced their descent from this holy place. 3 Indian "kundas" were \ntheir mothers\' natural children, begotten out of wedlock as gifts of the \nGoddess Kunda. 4 Of old the name applied to girls, as in China where \ngirls were once considered children of their mothers only, having no \nnatural connection with fathers. 5 \n\nIn ancient writings, the word for "cunt" was synonymous with \n"woman," though not in the insulting modern sense. An Egyptolo- \ngist was shocked to find the maxims of Ptah-Hotep "used for \'woman\' a \nterm that was more than blunt," though its indelicacy was not in the \neye of the ancient beholder, only in that of the modern scholar. 6 \n\nMedieval clergymen similarly perceived obscenity in female-geni- \ntal shrines of the pagans: holy caves, wells, groves. Any such place \nwas called cunnus diaboli, "devilish cunt." Witches who worshipped \nthere sometimes assumed the name of the place, like the male witch \nJohannes Cuntius mentioned by Thomas More. 7 "Under painful cir- \ncumstances" this witch died at the hands of witch hunters, but it was \nsaid he was resurrected, and came back to earth as a lecherous incubus. 8 \n\nSacred places identified with the world-cunt sometimes embar- \nrassed Victorian scholars who failed to understand their earlier \n\n\n\n197 \n\n\n\nCupid meaning. A.H. Clough became a laughing-stock among Gaelic-speak- \n\nCurse, Mother\'s ing students when he published a poem called Toper-na-Fuosich, \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m literally "bearded well," a Gaelic place-name for a cunt-shrine. The \nsynonym "twat" was ignorantly used by another Victorian poet, \nRobert Browning, in the closing lines of his Pippa Passes: \n\nThen, owls and bats, \n\nCowls and twats, \n\nMonks and nuns, in a cloisters moods, \n\nAdjourn to the oak-stump pantry! \n\nEditors of the Oxford English Dictionary hesitantly asked \n\nBrowning where he learned the word. He said it came from a bawdy \n\nbroadside poem of 1659: "They talked of his having a Cardinal\'s Hat; \n\nThey\'d send him as soon an Old Nun\'s Twat." Browning thought the \n\nword meant a wimple, or other headgear corresponding to "hat." 9 \n\n1. G.R. Scott, 188. 2. Dames, 110-14. 3. Briffault 1, 604. \n\n4. Mahanirvanatantra, 289. 5.

In the same way, Latin \ncaritas was altered from sensual or sexual giving to the modern \n"charity," giving of money. \n\nRenaissance art made emanations of Cupid into amoretti, "little \nloves," shown as winged babies. But ancient talismans of Cupid were \nnot babies; they were winged phalli of bronze, ivory, or wood, which \ngave rise to an Italian slang term for the penis, uccello, "little bird." \' \n\n1. Young, 74. \n\n\n\nCurse, Mother\'s \n\nIn ancient Asiatic belief, a mother\'s curse meant certain death. All \ndeath was brought about by the Goddess\'s word of destruction, as all \nbirth was brought about by her word of creation. By virtue of \nmotherhood, any woman could tap the verbal power of the Goddess. \nThe Markandaya Purana says, "for all curses there is some remedy; \nbut there is nothing anywhere that can dispel the curse of those who \nhave been cursed by a mother." J Similarly, the biblical Hannah \nrejoiced when she became a mother, saying, "My mouth is enlarged \nover mine enemies" (1 Samuel 2:1) because maternity gave her \ncurses an irresistible power. \n\n\n\n198 \n\n\n\nHomer tells the story of Meleager, cursed by his mother for \nmurdering her brothers. Falling on her knees, she knocked the earth \nwith her fists and called upon the underground Goddess. "And the \nFury that walks in the dark and has inexorable thoughts heard her \nfrom Erebus." 2 The Fury told Meleager\'s mother to burn his soul in \nthe form of a wand, so he was stricken with a fever, and soon died. 3 \n\nWitchcraft of this sort was not even necessary the curse alone \ncould kill. The Greek word for the effect of a mother\'s curse was \nmiasma, a kind of spiritual pollution bringing slow but sure destruction. \nMiasma could pursue members of a clan for many generations. The \ntragic family history of Orestes might be traced to a curse laid by the \nGoddess Artemis herself on his ancestor Atreus, who dared to \nwithhold the golden fleece of a sacrificial lamb she had sent, using it to \nconfirm his right to rule. 4 \n\nGods launched curses too, and some of them were spectacular, like \nthose with which Yahweh threatened all who disobeyed him: a \ncombination of pestilence, fever, consumption, inflammation, blasting, \nmildew, extreme burning, emerods (hemorrhoids), the scab, the itch, \nthe botch of Egypt, madness, blindness, slavery, great plagues of long \ncontinuance, and barrenness of the land (Deuteronomy 28). How- \never, the gods\' curses seemed not to arouse as much terror as those of \nGoddess or Mother. \n\nThe terrible vehicle of the feminine curse was menstrual blood, \nstill called The Curse. To "damn" has been linked with the Hebrew \ndam, "blood," specifically mother-blood, the fluid of the womb, an- \nciently thought to create one\'s very soul and destroy it. Dam was \nalso synonymous with "mother" (ma-dam, my mother). Elder women \npast menopause were thought to be the most efficient cursers, on the \nancient theory that their "wise blood" was retained in their bodies, \ngiving them numinous power to make their words come true. 5 This \nwas why medieval Europe believed any destructive charm having \nmenstrual blood as one of its ingredients must be irresistible, and why \nelder women were viewed as prototypical witches, their words or even \ntheir glances heavy with dread. \n\nFathers of the church even wooed converts with the assurance that \nthe Christian faith was strong enough to overcome a mother\'s curse, \nthe most powerful curse known to man. St. Augustine claimed that \nsome children cursed by their mother were afflicted by constant \nweakness and tremors, but St. Stephen converted them to Christianity, \nand they were completely cured of the effects of the curse. 6 \n\nEastern sages believed the feminine power of the curse must be \nallayed not so much by opposing it with a patriarchal religion, as by \ntreating women well, so they would not be inclined to use their \ndestructive power. The Laws of Manu said: \n\nWomen must be honored and adorned by their fathers, brothers, hus- \nbands, and brothers-in-law, who desire their own welfare. Where \nwomen are honored, there the gods are pleased, but where they are not \n\n\n\nCurse, Mother\'s \n\n\n\nLaws of Manu \n\nPost-Vedic treatise on \nholy law, composed or \ncollected some time \nbetween the 2nd \ncentury B.C. and the \n2nd century a.d. \n\n\n\n199 \n\n\n\nCut hbert , Saint honored, no sacred rite yields rewards. Where the female relations live \n\nin grief, the family soon wholly perishes; but that family where they are \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not unhappy ever prospers. The houses on which female relations, not \n\nbeing duly honored, pronounce a curse, perish completely, as if destroyed \nby magic. 7 \n\nThis advice came from the place northern Aryans called Mut- \nspellheim, the Home of the Mother\'s Curse, in "the hot lands of the \nsouth." According to the Scandinavian prophecy of doomsday, the \nMutspell would fall upon the violent patriarchal gods who ignored \nancient tribal bonds and rules of morality, and instituted cruel \nwarfare. The result of the Mother\'s Curse would be the death of all \ngods, their Gotterdammerung or Going-Into-the-Shadow; thus it \nseemed the Mother\'s word of destruction meant the end of the world. 8 \n\nChristian Gnostic writings reveal the same belief in a world- \ndestroying curse from a Great Mother disgusted with the cruel \nbehavior of the gods she created. In her anger, the Goddess would send \na great power from the place "where the firmament of woman is \nsituated," the Gnostic equivalent of Mutspellheim. "Then she will drive \nout the gods of Chaos whom she had created together with the first \nFather. She will cast them down to the abyss. They will be wiped out by \ntheir own injustice." 9 \n\nMyths in general suggest that a mother\'s curse was the necessary \ninstrument of destruction for any god, even a Savior-son, most of \nwhom were solemnly cursed before immolation. 10 Since a mother\'s \ncurse was immutable, no guilt accrued to the executioners who \ncarried out sacrificial killings in ancient dramas of death and resurrec- \ntion. Mythology bears out the archetypal idea that one who gives \nbirth has unlimited power over the life so given, and may retain control \nof that life\'s duration. \n\nAs a rule therefore, death curses usually employed female symbol- \nism. Typical was the curse of the "black fast," utilizing a black hen, \nonce sacred to the Queen of the Shades as destructive twin of the \nMother of the World Egg. The curse was accomplished by the \noperator and the black hen fasting together, every Friday for nine weeks \n(the Goddess\'s day and number). After this, an accursed one was sure \nto die. 11 \n\n1. O\'Flaherty, 68. 2. Cavendish, P.E., 122. 3. Graves, CM. 1, 266. \n\n4. Graves, CM. 2, 44. 5. Gifford, 26. 6. de Voragine, 57. 7.

He was periodically displayed, and always \npronounced remarkably fresh. His remains were last viewed in 1827 \nand found to be as plump and rosy as ever almost as if he were a \nwaxwork, if it were possible to suspect the church of perpetrating \nsuch a hoax. \n\nOddly enough, while his incorruptible body lay in Durham Cathe- \ndral, St. Cuthbert also lived on at the bottom of the sea, as a marine \nsmith-god who forged beads for rosaries in his ocean cave. Crinoid shells \nwashed up on Northumbrian beaches after storms were known as St. \nCuthbert\'s Beads. 1 \n\nThere was also a St. Cuthbert\'s Well, located near the famous \nEden Hall, whose "luck" talisman was a sacred chalice inherited from \nthe fairies. 2 The waters of St. Cuthbert\'s Well were credited with the \nusual miraculous powers of healing and preserving health. \n\n1.

Her triumphal procession \nwas "later glorified by marvelous legends, and the poets told of \nedifying miracles that had occurred during Cybele\'s voyage." l \n\nHer holy aniconic image was carried to Rome by order of the \nCumaean Sybil, a personification of the same cave-dwelling Goddess \nherself. As the Great Mother of all Asia Minor, she was worshipped \nespecially on Mt. Ida, Mt. Sipylus, Cyzicus, Sardis, and Pessinus in \nGalatia. 2 \n\nHer festivals were called ludi, "games." 3 A highlight of her \nworship was the Taurobolium, baptism in the blood of a sacred bull, \nwho represented her dying-god consort, Attis. Her temple stood on the \nVatican, where St. Peter\'s basilica stands today, up to the 4th century \na.d. when Christians took it over. 4 She was one of the leading deities of \nRome in the heyday of the mystery cults, along with Hecate and \nDemeter of Eleusis. 5 \n\nOther names for Cybele assimilated her to every significant form \nof the Great Goddess. She was the Berecynthian Mother (genetrix \nBerecynthia). She was Rhea Lobrine, Goddess of sacred caves, known \nas her "marriage bowers." 7 She was called Augusta, the Great One; \nAlma, the Nourishing One; Sanctissima, the Most Holy One. Roman \nemperors like Augustus, Claudius, and Antoninus Pius regarded her \nas the supreme deity of the empire. Augustus established his home \nfacing her temple, and looked upon his wife, the empress Livia \nAugusta, as an earthly incarnation of her. 8 The emperor Julian wrote an \nimpassioned address to her: \n\nWho is then the Mother of the Gods? She is the source of the intellectual \nand creative gods, who in their turn guide the visible gods; she is both \n\n\n\nVariations of \nCybele\'s name \nKubaba, Kuba, \nKube have been \nlinked with the \nKa\'aba stone at Mecca, \na meteoric "cube" \nthat bore the Goddess\'s \nsymbol and was once \nknown as the Old \nWoman. 6 \n\n\n\n201 \n\n\n\nCyboread the mother and the spouse of mighty Zeus; she came into being next to \n\nCynosure and together with the great creator; she is in control of every form of \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ life, and the cause of all generation; she easily brings to perfection all \n\nthings that are; she is the motherless maiden, enthroned at the side of \nZeus, and in very truth is the Mother of all the Gods. 9 \n\nFathers of the Christian church vehemently disagreed. St. Augus- \ntine called Cybele a harlot mother, "the mother, not of the gods, but \nof the demons." 10 \n\nOne of her names, Antaea, made her the mythical mother of the \nearth-giant Antaeus, who was invincible as long as his feet remained \nin contact with his Mother\'s body, the earth. Heracles conquered him \nby holding him up in the air. Churchmen believed the powers of \nwitches came from the same sort of contact with Mother Earth. \nArresting officers often carried witches to prison in a large basket, so \ntheir feet would not touch the ground. 11 \n\nThere was a Christian sect founded in the 2nd century a.d. by \nMontanus (Mountain man), a priest of Cybele, who identified Attis \nwith Christ. Montanus maintained that women were agents of the \nGoddess, and could preach and prophesy as well as men. This \ncontradicted the orthodox Pauline sect, which followed St. Paul\'s rule \nthat women must never speak publicly on holy subjects. 12 During the \n4th century, Montanist Christianity was declared a heresy, and many of \nits adherents were slain. Some Montanists in Asia Minor were locked \nin their churches and burned alive. 13 \n\n1. Cumont, O.R.R.P., 47 2. Encyc. Brit., "Great Mother of the Gods." \n\n3. James, 246. 4.

Danu, Danuna, Dana \n\nDanae \n\n\n\nEponymous Great Mother of the Danes and many other peoples, \nsuch as the Danaans, the Danaids, the biblical Danites, and the Irish \nTuatha De Danann, "people of the Goddess Dana." l The Russians \n\n\n\ncalled her Dennitsa, "Greatest of all Goddesses." A medieval Russian \nexorcism said: "In the morning let us rise and pray to God and \nDennitsa." 4 \n\nAs Danu-Ana, or Anu, she led the Irish trinity of Fates, collective- \nthe Morrigan. Mountains in Kerry are still named after her breasts, \nthe Paps of Anu. 5 Under the name of Don she was masculinized as a \n"king" of Dublin in late Irish legend; but the same "king" was also \ncalled Mother of the Gods. 6 Sometimes the Irish called her Domnu, a \nmother Goddess personifying the Deep. 7 \n\nClassical Greek mythology humanized the Goddess Danae, in \nmuch the same way as the Bible humanized Earth Mother Eve; the \ntwo were the same deity, fructified by the Heaven-father\'s seminal rain. \nThe Hellenic Danae was a virgin princess impregnated by Zeus\'s \nshower of golden rain that is, urine, to which primitives sometimes \nattributed the same reproductive power as semen. As result of this \nbeneficial moistening, Danae bore the hero Perseus, who annoyed \nfathers of the Christian church by being as verifiably god-begotten \nand virgin-born and their own savior. 9 But Danae, like Eve, was really \nanother name for the universal Triple Goddess, also called Dam-kina \nby the Sumerians, Dinah by the Hebrews, and Danu or Dunnu in \nBabylon. The Greeks knew of three Danaids, known as Telchines or \n"Enchanters," who founded the three chief cities of Rhodes. 10 \n\nWriters of the Old Testament disliked the Danites, whom they \ncalled serpents (Genesis 49:17). Nevertheless, they adopted Dan-El \nor Daniel, a Phoenician god of divination, and transformed him into a \nHebrew prophet. His magic powers like those of the Danites emanat- \ned from the Goddess Dana and her sacred serpents. He served as court \nastrologer and dream-interpreter for both the Persian king Cyrus, and \nthe Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (Daniel 1:21, 2:1), indicating \nthat "Daniel" was not a personal name but a title, like the Celtic one: \n"a person of the Goddess Dana." \n\n1.

To the \nHindus she was \n"Waters of Heaven," \nmother of the Vedic \ngods. 3 \n\nIn Saxon myth, \nDanu-Ana became \nBlack Annis, or \nAnna of the Angles, or \nthe Blue Hag, or \nAngurboda, mother of \nHel. An ancient \ncave-shrine at Dane\'s \nHill in Leicestershire \nwas her dwelling place, \nknown as Black \nAnnis\'s Bower. 8 \n\n\n\nDaphne \n\n"Laurel," the plant of prophecy chewed by the Goddess\'s priestesses \nin the vale of Tempe, until Apollo\'s cult replaced hers, and restricted \nlaurel-chewing to the Delphic Pythoness. 1 The Goddess\'s original \nname was Daphoene, "Bloody One," in early times when her Maenads \nwere still performing blood sacrifices. \n\nOrgiastic Daphne entered classical mythology as a purified virgin \nwho was saved from rape by Apollo through a transformation into a \nlaurel tree in the nick of time. The myth seems to have been suggested \nby an icon showing the Goddess\'s face looking down from the \nbranches of a laurel tree upon the sacred king immolated at her feet. \n\n\n\n207 \n\n\n\nDark Age Laurel remained the plant of inspiration and poetic frenzy. Laurel \n\ncrowns were given to the best poets, who were then called "laureate"- \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ laurel-crowned. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,81. \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\nWestern histories have put forth many theories about the fall of \nRome and attributed the onset of the Dark Age to a wide variety of \ncauses, except the one cause that may have had more to do with it \nthan any other: Christianity. 1 By denying women\'s spiritual significance \nand forbidding Goddess worship, the church alienated both sexes \nfrom their pagan sense of unity with the divine through each other. \n\nChristians said one of the diabolic symptoms of the oncoming end \nof the world was "the spread of knowledge," which they endeavored \nto check with wholesale book-burnings, destruction of libraries and \nschools, and opposition to education for laymen. 2 By the end of the \n5th century, Christian rulers forcibly abolished the study of philosophy, \nmathematics, medicine, and geography. Lactantius said no Christian \nshould study astronomy. Pope Gregory the Great denounced all secular \neducation as folly and wickedness, and forbade Christian laymen to \nread even the Bible. He burned the library of the Palatine Apollo, "lest \nits secular literature distract the faithful from the contemplation of \nheaven." 3 \n\nIn the church\'s view, every opinion except its own was heretical \nand devilish, likely to raise doubts in the minds of believers. There- \nfore, pagan intellectuals and teachers were persecuted and schools were \nclosed. Christian emperors commanded the burning of all books of \nthe philosophers, as Theodosius said, "for we would not suffer any of \nthose things so much as to come to men\'s ears, which would tend to \nprovoke God to wrath and offend the minds of the pious." After years of \nvandalism and destruction, St. John Chrysostom proudly boasted, \n"Every trace of the old philosophy and literature of the ancient world \nhas vanished from the face of the earth." 4 \n\nIt was almost true. Christian persecutions left "but few fragments \nof a vast liturgy and religious literature of paganism which would have \ncast many a ray of light on the origins of our own faith; and demolished \nholy places and beautiful temples such as the world shall never rear \nagain." 5 After temples were destroyed, monks and hermits were settled \nin the ruins to defile the site with their excrement, and to prevent \nreconstruction. 6 \n\nRulers melted down bronze, gold, and silver artworks for money. \nPeasants broke up marble gods and goddesses and fed their pieces \ninto limekilns for mortar. 7 It is recorded that 4th-century Rome had 424 \ntemples, 304 shrines, 80 statues of deities in precious metal, 64 \nstatues of ivory, 3,700 statues in bronze, and thousands in marble. By \n\n\n\n208 \n\n\n\nthe next century, nearly all of them were gone. The historian \nEunapius, a hierophant of the Eleusinian Mysteries, watched the \ndestruction and wrote that the empire was being overwhelmed by a \n"fabulous and formless darkness mastering the loveliness of the world." 8 \n\nRoman society was losing its cohesiveness and discipline, with the \nusual symptoms of social decline: runaway inflation, shortages, crime, \napathy, and a discouraged middle class taxed to the breaking point to \nsupport a top-heavy, stagnant bureaucracy. 9 Most Christians came \nnot from that middle class, but from the lower elements of society, \ntaking advantage of lawless times to grab what they could. Celsus said \nthe Christians invited into their ranks "whosoever is a sinner or \nunintelligent, or a fool, in a word, whosoever is god-forsaken, him the \nkingdom of God will receive. Now whom do you mean by the sinner \nbut the wicked: thief, housebreaker, poisoner, temple robber, grave \nrobber?. . . Jesus, they say, was sent to save sinners; was he not sent to \nhelp those who have kept themselves free from sin? They pretend \nthat God will save the unjust man if he repents and humbles himself. \nThe just man who has held steadily from the cradle in the ways of \nvirtue he will not look upon." 10 \n\nBertrand Russell described the philosophical outlook of St. Jerome: \n"He thinks the preservation of virginity more important than victory \nover the Huns and Vandals and Goths. Never once do his thoughts turn \nto any possible measure of practical statesmanship; never once does \nhe point out the evils of the fiscal system, or of reliance on an army \ncomposed of barbarians. The same is true of Ambrose and Augus- \ntine. ... It is no wonder that the Empire fell into ruin." n \n\nConventional histories presented a picture of early Christians as \npeaceable souls, unjustly persecuted. This picture could only have \narisen because historical writing was monopolized by the church for \nmany centuries, and there was no compunction about changing or \nfalsifying records. Pagan Rome didn\'t persecute religious minorities. \n"It never disputed the existence or reality of other deities, and the \naddition of a new member to the Pantheon was a matter of indiffer- \nence. . . . [A]U deities of all peoples were regarded as but manifestations \nof the one supreme deity." Dionysus, Venus, and Priapus were \nhonored co-residents of the temple of Isis in Pompeii. Italian and Greek \ndeities mixed together in the temple of Mithra at Ostia. 12 All deities \nwere willing to co-exist except the Christian one. The Christian church \nalone "has always held the toleration of others to be the persecution \nof itself." 1J As early as 382 a.d., the church officially declared that any \nopposition to its own creed in favor of others must be punished by the \ndeath penalty. 14 \n\nContrary to the conventional mythology, Christians were not \nprosecuted under Roman law for being Christians but for committing \ncivil crimes. 15 They caused riots, "often tumultuously interrupted the \npublic worship, and continually railed against the national religion." 16 \nThey seem to have been guilty of vandalism and arson. The Great Fire \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\n\n\n209 \n\n\n\nDaik Age in 64 a.d. was set by Christians who were "anxiously waiting for the \n\nworld to end by fire and who did at times start fires in order to prompt \n^^^^^^^^^^^ God." 17 Crying that the world would end at any moment, Christian \nfanatics sometimes developed the notion that starting the fires of the \nfinal holocaust would redound to their credit in heaven. 18 At least one \nsaint was canonized for no particular reason other than having been an \narsonist: St. Theodore, whose sole claim to fame was burning down \nthe temple of the Mother of the Gods. 19 \n\nThe decline of Roman civilization and the onset of the Dark Age \nwas the period Gilbert Murray characterized as the western world\'s \nfailure of nerve. It marked the transition of the west from a position of \ncultural leadership to one of regressed barbarism, and transformed \nEurope into what is now known as an "undeveloped area." 20 Intellect, \ntaste, and imagination disappeared from art and literature. Rather \nthan broadening the western mind, its church crippled that mind by \nallowing childish superstitions to flourish in an atmosphere of igno- \nrance and unreason. 21 Suppression of the teaching priestess or alma \nmaterled to an eclipse of education in general. \n\nMany scholars fled from Christian persecutions eastward to Iran, \nwhere the Sassanid king helped them found a school of medicine and \nscience. This was the world\'s intellectual capital for two centuries. 22 \nAlready in 529, when Justinian closed the Athenian schools, Helle- \nnistic learning had been dispersed to Sassanian Persia, Gupta India, ant \nCeltic Ireland. 23 \n\nChurch historians have claimed nothing of real value was lost in \nthe destruction of pagan culture. Modern scholars disagree. The \nhavoc that afflicted art, science, literature, philosophy, engineering, \narchitecture, and all other fields of achievement has been likened to \nthe havoc of the Gigantomachia as if the crude giants overthrew the \nintelligent gods. The widespread literacy of the classical period \ndisappeared. Aqueducts, harbors, buildings, even the splendid Roman \nroads fell into ruin. It has been pointed out that centuries of \ndevastating war could hardly have shattered Roman civilization as \neffectively as did its new obsession with an ascetic monotheism. 24 \n\nBooks and artworks were destroyed because they expressed un- \nchristian ideas and images. 25 The study of medicine was forbidden, \non the ground that all diseases were caused by demons and could be \ncured only by exorcism. This theory was still extant in the time of \nPope Alexander III, who forbade monks to study any techniques of \nhealing other than verbal charms. 26 Under the Christian emperors, \neducated citizens were persecuted by the illiterate who claimed their \nbooks were witchcraft texts. Often, "magical" writings were planted \nby Christian magistrates for the sake of the financial rewards they \nreceived when they caught and executed heretics a system the \nInquisition also used to advantage in later centuries. Priestesses were \nespecially persecuted, because they were female, wealthy, and laid \nclaim to spiritual authority. 27 \n\nFathers of the church seemed cynically aware that public igno- \n\n210 \n\n\n\nranee worked in their favor. Gregory of Nazianzus wrote to St. Jerome: \n"A little jargon is all that is necessary to impose upon the people. The \nless they comprehend, the more they admire. Our forefathers and \ndoctors have often said, not what they thought, but what circumstances \nand necessity dictated." 28 \n\nLactantius declared that pagan temples should be torn down \nbecause, in them, "The demons are attempting to destroy the \nkingdom of God, and by means of false miracles and lying oracles are \nassuming the appearance of real gods." 29 It was dangerous to leave \nthe temples intact, even when they were converted into Christian \nchurches. The temple of the Mother of Heaven at Carthage was \nmade over into a church, but in 440 a.d. the bishop discovered that the \nCarthaginians were actually making their devotions to the old God- \ndess, and ordered the entire temple area leveled to the ground. 30 \n\nIgnorance was helpful to the spread of the faith; so ignorance \nwas fostered. Knight says, "Men are superstitious in proportion as they \nare ignorant, and . . . those who know least of the principles of \nreligion are the most earnest and fervent." 31 In keeping western Europe \nas ignorant as possible, however, the church lost much of its history. \nEven contemporary events went inaccurately reported, or altogether \nunnoted. Events of the past were absurdly garbled. All the public \nknew of history was provided by bards, who tried to maintain the druidic \ntradition of rote-learning, with indifferent success. They taught, for \nexample, that Alexander the Great made an expedition to the Garden \nof Eden, where he was instructed by the poet-magician Virgil, by \n"Monsignor St. Paul," and by "Tholomeus" (Ptolemy), king of Egypt. \nThey taught that Julius Caesar was a king of Hungary and Austria, \nand a prince of Constantinople; his mother was the Valkyrie Brunn- \nhilde, a daughter of Judas Maccabeus; he married Morgana, the \nFairy Queen, and became the father of Oberon and St. George. 32 \n\nThe field of natural science was in even worse disorder. Learned \nbooks taught that mice do not reproduce like other mammals but are \ngenerated spontaneously and asexually from "the putrefaction of the \nearth"; that wasps produce themselves out of a dead horse and bees \nout of a dead calf; that a crab deprived of its legs and buried will turn \ninto a scorpion; that some mammals, such as hares, can change from \none sex to the other; that a duck dried into powder and placed in water \nwill generate frogs; that a duck baked and buried will generate toads; \nthat asparagus is produced from buried shavings of ram\'s horn; that \nscorpions can be created from garden basil rubbed between two \nstones; that rain and lightning can be raised by burning a chameleon\'s \nliver on a rooftop; that no fleas can breed where a man scatters dust \ndug up from his right footprint in the place where he heard the first \nspringtime call of a cuckoo. 33 Because the very idea of experimenta- \ntion to test hypotheses had been replaced by credulous reliance on \ntheological authority, even notions that would have been simple to \ntest remained untested. \n\nAs for more complex hypotheses, they were beyond the ken of \n\n\n\nDark Age \n\n\n\n211 \n\n\n\nDavid, Saint theologians. Pagan thinkers long ago understood the shape of the \n\nearth, and even calculated its approximate circumference with only a \n\n^ ^^ m small error. But Lactantius and other learned churchmen called this \n\nfield of endeavor "bad and senseless," and proved by quoting the Bible \nthat the earth was flat. 34 \n\nThe most thoroughly Christianized nations hardly began to recov- \ner from the church\'s eclipse of learning until the present century. In \nSpain for example, the tradition of book-burning became an integral \npart of the auto-da-fe in 1 502. It was against the law for any layman \nto read any book not approved by the bishops. 35 To own vernacular \ncopies of either Testament of the Bible was punishable by burning at \nthe stake. 36 Reading declined to almost nothing. What few grammar \nschools existed were only "superficial preparation for the priesthood." \nStill, many priests were illiterate. General education was attempted only \nafter the revolutions of 1834 and 1855, when the monasteries were \nsuppressed. Yet in 18%, more than two-thirds of the population were \nstill unable to read or write. 37 \n\nSpanish suspicion of books carried over into the New World, and \ndeprived anthropologists and archeologists of literary treasures that \nmight have shed much light on pre-Columbian civilizations. Spanish \nfriars "converted" the Maya of Yucatan in 1 562, by their usual \nforceful methods, such as torture and burning. They fed the fires with \nhundreds of Maya sacred books which, had they survived, would \nhave greatly assisted modern scholars to unravel the mysteries of Mayan \nscript. The friars said the natives were "greatly afflicted" by the loss of \ntheir scriptures; but as far as the friars could see, these books "contained \nnothing in which there was not to be seen superstition and lies of the \ndevil, so we burned them all." 58 \n\n1.

Von Hagen, 432. \n\n\n\nDavid, Saint \n\nPatron saint of Wales, actually a pagan god Christianized in the 1 1th \ncentury a.d. He was the Welsh sea god worshipped as Dewi, from the \nAryan devior deva, "deity." Though he was called a 6th-century \nbishop, nothing was written of him until 1090, more than 500 years \nlater. His wholly unreliable biography was composed chiefly to \nsupport the Welsh bishops\' independence at the time. 1 \n\n\n\n212 \n\n\n\nThe city now called St. David\'s used to be Menevia, "Way of the Death \n\nMoon," the same as Danish Manavegr and Irish E-Mania, the lunar \nparadise. 2 ^^^^^^^^^^^_ \n\nSymbol of David-Dewi was the Great Red Serpent, now the red \ndragon, Wales\'s national emblem. Like the phallic god Python or \nOceanus encircling the World Egg, he may have been reddened by his \nunion with the Moon-goddess Mab, who gave sovereignty to all her \nkings by staining them red. 3 \n\nDavid\'s title, the Waterman, was explained by Christian scholars to \nmean he was a teetotaler. 4 Welsh sailors knew better; their traditions \nplaced him in the depths of the sea. They called him Davy Jones, who \nlike the sea god Mananann kept the souls of drowned seamen in his \n"locker." 5 \n\nWaterman was a popular title for several ancient gods of waters \nbesides Dewi: notably Ceadda, a Mercian god of medicinal springs, \nwho was canonized twice (see Chad). \n\nEven in Christian disguise, David retained the sacred skills of a \nbard. It was claimed that his miraculous talent for harping and singing \ncame from his lineal descent from the virgin Mary, of the ancient house \nof King David the Harpist, in the eighteenth generation. Mary was \nalso identified with the Welsh sea-goddess Marian, Dewi\'s bride, \nreceiver of the souls of the dead. Welsh bards called their death songs \nmarwysgafen, the "giving to Mary," sung to send the funeral boat to the \nIsles of the Dead. 6 \n\nSometimes David was confused with Merlin, who allegedly harped \nand sang the stones of Stonehenge into their places. Some legends \nmade David a bishop of Merlin\'s town, Caerleon. 7 Some said David \nwas King Arthur\'s uncle. Like many mythical saints, he was given a \nlong lifetime to demonstrate the health-giving virtues of Christian faith; \nhe lived to the age of 140 years. 8 His mother was the same virgin \ntemple-maiden who gave birth to nearly every ancient god; here she was \nSt. Non (Holy Nun). 9 Two cities claimed his shrine, located not only \nat St. David\'s but also in the city of Chester, which used to be named \nDeva or Dewi. 10 \n\n1.

Cumont, M.M., 57. \n\n\n\nIth \n\nbeen said that Death came into existence only with the rise of \nman\'s consciousness, a roundabout way of saying death is more real for \nhumans than for any other animal, because only humans foresee it. 1 \nReligions owe their existence to the unique ability of the human animal \nto understand that it must die. \n\nAgainst this realization the forces of imagination are mustered to \ndeny it. It\'s hard for any perceiving mind to perceive its own \n\n\n\n213 \n\n\n\nDeath notbeing, with cessation of all perception. Worshippers of Kali managed \n\nto view the beyond-death state as Dreamless Sleep. 2 But most ancient \n^^^^^^^^^^^ people couldn\'t formulate an idea of non-perception. \n\nEven when the land of the dead was minimally stimulating, as in \nthe Babylonian concept, it was perceptible to the senses. It was the \nHouse of Dust, and the end of the Road of No Return. The dead \nwere clothed in feathers, like birds. "Dust is their food and clay their \nmeat . . . , they see no light, they sit in darkness." Yet in the same \nHouse of Dust there were priests and kings ruling, and servants to carry \nthe baked meats and pour water from water skins. 3 \n\nBabylonian literature reveals a hope that eventually the right ritual \ncure for death will be discovered, rather as modern people hope for a \ncure for cancer. The recommended avenue of investigation was necro- \nmantic consultation with the dead themselves. "The quest for \nimmortality was essentially the search for the right ritual, the knowledge \nof what to do in order to secure a continued existence of the body \nafter death. This knowledge is possessed by the ancestors, and can only \nbe obtained from them." 4 \n\nMen have usually believed that knowledge of death can only come \nfrom those who have experienced it. Hence the initiatory procedures \ninvolving mock death, as among Siberian shamans, who experience in \ntrances being torn apart and reduced to bare bones. "By thus seeing \nhimself naked, altogether freed from the perishable and transient flesh \nand blood, he consecrates himself, in the sacred tongue of the \nshamans, to his great task, through that part of his body which will \nlongest withstand the action of the sun, wind and weather, after he is \ndead. . . . [I]n certain Central Asian meditations that are Buddhistic and \ntantric in origin or at least in structure, reduction to the skeleton \ncondition has . . . an ascetic and metaphysical value anticipating the \nwork of time, reducing life by thought to what it really is, an \nephemeral illusion in perpetual transformation." 5 \n\nSo vivid were the fantasies of the death-world that some Oriental \nsages prayed for sufficient conscious sense to realize that they were \nnothing more than inventions of the mind: "May I recognize whatever \nvisions appear, as the reflections of my own consciousness. May I \nknow them to be of the nature of apparitions in the intermediate State. \nMay I not fear the troops of my own thought forms, the Peaceful \n\nDeities and the Wrathful May it come that all the Sounds will be \n\nknown as one\'s own sounds; may it come that all the Radiances will . 1 \nbe known as one\'s own radiances." 6 \n\nTantric Buddhism proposed that the death world or Intermediate \nState could be controlled if one were prepared through carefully \nguided fantasy in life to retain memory, consciousness, and the goal of \nchoosing for one\'s self the right "womb-door" for a better reincarna- \ntion. 7 Living and dying were only complementary aspects of the same \ncycle, both requiring proper education. "Material life moves between \ntwo poles," Bachofen says. "Its realm is not that of being but that of \n\n\n\n214 \n\n\n\nbecoming and passing away, the eternal alternation of two colors, the \nLvhite of life and the black of death. Only through the equal mixture of \n!he two is the survival of the material world assured. Without death \nho rejuvenation is possible ... the positive power cannot for one mo- \nhtient exist without the negative power. Death, then, is not the \nbpposite but the helper of life." 8 \n\nThe Great Goddess was intimately involved in every manifestation \npf death as she was in those of life, which is why she had an \n[\'emanation" for each fatal disease, such as Mari-Amma, Ankamma, \nMutteyalamma, etc. Her priestesses supported and taught the dying. \n\'As among the gods, so among the mortals was death everywhere \nvoman\'s business. A woman is said to have invented the wailing for \nhe dead. . . . Women cradle the infant and the corpse, each to its \n^articular new life." 9 \n\nRomans thought death should be kept in mind at all times, \nspecially when life at its peak might make one forget the other, \nqually necessary part of the cycle. When a military hero entered Rome \nn triumphal procession, riding in a golden chariot, hailed as a god in \nhe ancient equivalent of a ticker-tape parade, a person wearing the \nnask and costume of Death stood at his shoulder, preserving him \nrom the sin of hubris by saying each moment in his ear, "Man, \nemember you will die." 10 \n\nPaganism fostered the Tantric idea of growth and decline in \necurrent cycles. "The old fertility gods did not shrink from the fact \n>f death; they sought no infantile evasion, but promised rebirth and \nenewal." u Christianity on the other hand denied that members of \nts sect could die. Early Christians who died were said to have "fallen \nsleep," soon to wake up again with the second coming of Christ. A \nnorbid anxiety often accompanied ritual denial. Kermode says, "Chris- \nianity of all the great religions is the most anxious, is the one which \naid the most emphasis on the terror of death." 12 \n\nSometimes fear became obsession, in a love-hate relationship with \neath. In the Secret Book of James, Jesus recommended suicide, \nmarking that the kingdom of death could only belong to those who \n>ut themselves to death, and no one who avoided this duty could be \naved. 13 \n\nObsession flowered into a thousand elaborate death customs and \nituals aimed at encapsulating the phenomenon, separating it from \nrdinary life experience so its inevitability need not be fully understood, \nn Frazer\'s opinion such customs and rituals have been the most \nwasteful ever seen in any society: \n\nNo belief has done so much to retard the economic and thereby the social \nprogress of mankind as has the belief in the immortality of the soul; for \nthis belief has led race after race, generation after generation, to sacrifice \nthe real wants of the living to the imaginary wants of the dead. The \nwaste and destruction of life and property which this faith has entailed are \nenormous and incalculable. \' 4 \n\n\n\nDeath \n\n\n\nSecret Book of \nJames One of the so- \ncalled Gnostic \nGospels discovered at \nNag Hammadi in \nUpper Egypt, 1945, \npurporting to have \nbeen written by the \napostle James. \n\n\n\n215 \n\n\n\nDeath Pagan philosophers\' acceptance of death may have been more \n\npractical than the elaborate denials that arose later. With a somber but \n\n^________ _ courageous serenity, Euripides stated the pagan idea that opinions on \n\ndeath are not possible: \n\nBut if any far-off state there be \n\nDearer to life than mortality \n\nThe hand of the Dark hath hold thereof, \n\nAnd mist is under the mist above; \n\nSo we are sick for life, and cling \n\nOn earth to this nameless and shining thing, \n\nFor other life is a fountain sealed, \n\nAnd the deeps below are unrevealed, \n\nAnd we drift on legends for ever. IS \n\nBecause they were westerners, the Greek philosophers have \nbeen given more credit for originality than they deserved. Actually, their \nopinions of death and its implications for the living were largely taken \nfrom Oriental sages who evolved them first. Greek notions of the \nDreamless Sleep, of reincarnation, of the four ages of man including \nthe primordial Age of Giants, all were derived from Oriental sources. \nTantric sages spoke of the faraway Golden Age when all men were \ngiants and lived lifetimes of about a thousand years each, because they \nwere nearer in time to the world\'s creation, when the Goddess\'s \nnourishing birth blood was more abundant and the knowledge of her \nwas more intimate among her children. As the Bible said, there were \ngiants in the earth in those days (Genesis 6:4). 16 \n\nThe same long-lived giants were identified with their own ances- \ntors by the authors of Genesis. The Hindu concept of human \nlongevity in the Golden Age was copied into the Bible as a quality of the \nearly patriarchs not quite a thousand years apiece, but at least more \nthan nine centuries. Adam lived to be 930 years old; Seth 912 years; \nEnos 905 years; and so on, the champion being Methusaleh at 969 \nyears (Genesis 5). \n\nHowever long delayed, though, death must come, and that was the \nthought that patriarchal thinkers found unacceptable. The older \nmatriarchal religions were more realistic in their acceptance of death, \nmaking it the sage\'s duty to realize the ugliness, corruption, and \ndecay in nature as fully as he might realize its beauty: to accord death \nthe same value as birth. The two were of equal importance, as two \npassages through the same Door: one coming out, the other going in. \nDifferent forms of the Goddess represented the idea. On the one \nhand she was the beautiful nubile Virgin or the tender nurturing \nMother; on the other hand she was a hideous ghoul, herself corpse- \nlike and a devourer of corpses and these two forms of her were to be \nadored equally. Avalon justly remarked that in the west, "the terrible \nbeauty of such forms is not understood"; missionaries could only \ndescribe the Death-goddess as a she-devil. 17 Yet, for the enlightened, \n\n\n\n216 \n\n\n\n"This fanged and bloody Goddess is the same as the other, the beautiful Deborah \n\n) mother and lover. To be able to superimpose and adore both images Delilah \n\n! in one is perhaps the solidest beginning on the road of sadhana." 18 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSome individuals in western culture arrived more or less indepen- \njdently at the vision of this archetypal female death spirit. Wherever \nthere was a concept of Mother Nature, it could hardly fail to be noticed \nthat it was natural to die, and the roots of every flower lay in organic \nrot. Coleridge spoke of the "Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH" as a \n(woman. Keats described himself as "half in love with easeful Death." \niLike the Oriental sages, Alfred de Vigny perceived Death as a maternal \n[Goddess: "O Death divine, at whose recall / Returneth all / To fade \nin thy embrace, / Gather thy children to thy bosom starred, / Free us \nfrom time, from number, and from space, / And give us back the rest \nthat life hath marred." 19 \n\nI. von Franz, pi. 7. 2.

Deborah lived under a sacred \nDalm tree that also bore her name, and was identified with the maternal \nTree of Life, like Xikum, the Tree of Ishtar. The Bible called her a \n\'prophetess" or "judge" to disguise the fact that she was one of the \ngoverning matriarchs of a former age (Judges 4:4). \n\nOne of Deborah\'s alternate names was Jael, "the Goddess Jah," \nwssibly the same one patriarchal Persians called Jahi the Whore, an \narlier feminine form of Yahweh. 2 \n\n1. Sobol, 138; Neumann, CM., 267. 2. Albright, 23. \n\n\n\nDelilah \n\n\'She Who Makes Weak," a name compounded of De (daleth), the \n\'onic Door, and lilu, the lotus, another yonic symbol. She was the \nGoddess who "weakened" the sun god every day and sent him to his \nleath on the wheel that turned him under the earth. In the case of \n>amson who was the sun god Shams-On, or Shamash it was the \nnill wheel. In the case of Heracles, another name for the same solar \nleity, it was Omphale\'s wheel: the omphalos often represented by the \nosmic yoni. \n\n\n\n217 \n\n\n\nDelphi Delphi \n\nDemeter \n\n\n\n"Womb"; Greece\'s oldest, most famous oracle, where Mother Earth \nwas worshipped under the name of Delphyne, the Womb of Creation, \nalong with her serpent-son and consort Python. 1 At various times the \noracle was said to belong to the Sea-goddess, or the Moon-goddess, \nvarious designations of the same primal Mother, whose priestess- \ndaughters, the Pythonesses, controlled the rites. Eventually the \npatriarchal god Apollo took it over, retaining the Pythonesses, but \nclaiming to have placed the Serpent in his underground uterine cave, \nwhence came the oracle\'s inspiration. Apollo murdered the priestess \nDelphyne, and held the oracle until it was closed by the Christian \nemperor Theodosius. After him, Arcadius had the temple entirely \ndestroyed. \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,80. \n\n\n\nDemeter \n\nGreek meter is "mother." De is the delta, or triangle, a female- \ngenital sign known as "the letter of the vulva" in the Greek sacred \nalphabet, as in India it was the Yoni Yantra, or yantra of the vulva. 1 \nCorresponding letters Sanskrit dwr, Celtic duir, Hebrew daleth \nmeant the Door of birth, death, or the sexual paradise. 2 Thus, \nDemeter was what Asia called "the Doorway of the Mysterious Femi- \nnine ... the root from which Heaven and Earth sprang." ? In \nMycenae, one of Demeter\'s earliest cult centers, tholos tombs with their \ntriangular doorways, short vaginal passages and round domes, repre- \nsented the womb of the Goddess from which rebirth might come. \nDoorways generally were sacred to women. In Sumeria they were \npainted red, representing the female "blood of life." 4 In Egypt, door- \nways were smeared with real blood for religious ceremonies, a custom \ncopied by the Jews for their Passover rites. \n\nThe triangle-door-yoni symbolized Demeter\'s trinity. Like all the \noldest forms of the basic Asiatic Goddess she appeared as Virgin, \nMother, and Crone, or Creator, Preserver, Destroyer, like Kali-Cunti \nwho was the same yoni-mother. Demeter\'s Virgin form was Kore, \nthe Maiden, sometimes called her "daughter," as in the classical myth \nof the abduction of Kore, which divided the two aspects of the \nGoddess into two separate individuals. Demeter\'s Mother form had \nmany names and titles, such as Despoena, "the Mistress"; Daeira, \n"the Goddess"; the Barley-Mother; the Wise One of Earth and Sea; or \nPluto, "Abundance." This last name was transferred to the male \nunderworld god said to have taken the Maiden into the earth-womb \nduring the dark season when fields lay fallow. But this was a late, \nartificial myth. The original Pluto was female, and her "riches" were \npoured out on the world from her breasts. 5 \n\nThe Crone phase of Demeter, Persephone-the-Destroyer, was \n\n\n\n218 \n\n\n\nidentified with the Virgin in late myth, so the Maiden abducted into \nthe underworld was sometimes Kore, sometimes Persephone. Some of \nthe Destroyer\'s other, earlier names were Melaina, the Black One; \nDemeter Chthonia, the Subterranean One; or The Avenger (Erinys). \nHer black-robed, mare-headed idol, her mane entwined with Gorgon \nsnakes, appeared in one of her oldest cave-shrines, Mavrospelya, the \nBlack Cave, in Phigalia (southwest Arcadia). She carried a dolphin \nI and a dove, symbols of womb and yoni. Like the devouring death- \ngoddess everywhere, she was once a cannibal. She ate the flesh of \nPelops, then restored him to life in her cauldron. 6 She was as fearsome \nas every other version of the Crone. The legendary medieval Night- \nMare an equine Fury who tormented sinners in their sleep was \nbased on ancient images of Mare-headed Demeter. \n\nHer cult was already well established at Mycenae in the 1 3th \ncentury B.C. and continued throughout Greece well into the Chris- \ntian era, a length of time almost equal to the lifespan of Christianity \nitself. 7 Her temple at Eleusis, one of the greatest shrines in Greece, \nbecame the center of an elaborate mystery-religion. Sophocles wrote, \n"Thrice happy they of men who looked upon these rites ere they go \nto Hades\'s house; for they alone there have true life." Aristides said, \n"The benefit of the festival is not merely the cheerfulness of the \nmoment and the freedom and respite from all previous troubles, but also \nthe possession of happier hopes concerning the end, hopes that our \nlife hereafter will be the better, and that we shall not lie in darkness and \nfilth the fate that is believed to await the uninitiated." Isocrates said: \n"Demeter . . . being graciously minded towards our forefathers because \nof their services to her, services of which none but the initiated may \nhear, gave us the greatest of all gifts, first, those fruits of the earth which \nsaved us from living the life of beasts, and secondly, that rite which \nmakes happier the hopes of those that participate therein concerning \nboth the end of life and their whole existence." 8 \n\nEleusis meant "advent." Its principal rites brought about the \nadvent of the Divine Child or Savior, variously named Brimus, \nDionysus, Triptolemus, Iasion, or Eleuthereos, the Liberator. Like the \ncorn, he was born of Demeter-the-earth and laid in a manger or \nwinnowing basket. 9 His flesh was eaten by communicants in the form of \nbread, made from the first or last sheaves. His blood was drunk in the \nform of wine. Like Jesus, he entered the Earth and rose again. \nCommunicants were supposed to partake of his immortality, and \nafter death they were known as Demetreioi, blessed ones belonging to \nDemeter. 10 \n\nRevelations were imparted to the initiate through secret "things \nheard, things tasted, and things seen." " This formula immediately \ncalls to mind the three admonitory monkeys covering ears, mouth, and \neyes, supposed to illustrate the maxim, "Hear no evil, speak no evil, \nsee no evil." Was the "evil" a secret descended from Eleusinian \nreligion? Demeter was worshipped as "the Goddess" by Greek \n\n\n\nDemeter \n\n\n\n219 \n\n\n\nDemetra, Saint peasants all the way through the Middle Ages, even up to the 19th \n\ncentury at Eleusis where she was entitled "Mistress of Earth and \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Sea." In 1801 two Englishmen named Clarke and Cripps caused a riot \namong the peasants by taking the Goddess\'s image away to a \nmuseum in Cambridge. 12 \n\nEarly Christians were much opposed to the Eleusinian rites \nbecause of their overt sexuality, even though their goal was "regener- \nation and forgiveness of sins." 13 Asterius said, "Is not Eleusis the scene \nof descent into the darkness, and of the solemn acts of intercourse \nbetween the hierophant and the priestess, alone together? Are not the \ntorches extinguished, and does not the large, the numberless assem- \nbly of common people believe that their salvation lies in that which is \nbeing done by the two in the darkness?" H Fanatic monks destroyed \nthe temple of these sexual mysteries in 396 a.d., but the site remained \nholy to the Goddess\'s votaries, and the ceremonies were carried on \nthere and elsewhere. 15 \n\nRustics never ceased believing that Demeter\'s spirit was manifest \nin the final sheaf of the harvest, often called the Demeter, the Corn \nMother, the Old Woman, etc. At harvest festivals it was often dressed in \nwoman\'s clothing and laid in a manger to make the cattle thrive. 16 \nSecret anti-Christian doctrines of medieval Freemasonry also drew \nsome symbolism from the cults of the ancient Mistress of Earth and \nSea, particularly the masonic sacred image of Plenty: "an ear of corn \nnear a fall of water." 17 The ultimate Mystery was revealed at Eleusis \nin "an ear of corn reaped in silence" a sacred fetish that the Jews \ncalled shibboleth. 18 \n\n1.

The saint\'s daughter \n(Kore) was kidnapped by "a wicked Turkish wizard" (Hades) and \nlocked up in a tower. A young hero rescued her, but perished \nmiserably, chopped in pieces by the wizard and hung from the tower\'s \nwalls "between heaven and earth." Guided by a stork (her ancient \ntotemic bird of birth), St. Demetra arrived on the scene, reassembled \n\n\n\n220 \n\n\n\nthe hero, and brought him back to life. Several elements of this story Demon \n\nwere repeated in the Germanic fairy tale of Rapunzel. \n\nA masculinized version of Demeter or perhaps one of her \n\nDemetreioi was accepted into the canon as a "St. Demetrius," of \nno known date, and no real biography. His legend, established in the \nlate Middle Ages, made him a warrior saint like the equally mythical \nSt. George. The basic story was invented to publicize his healing relics \npreserved at Salonika. 2 \n\n1. Lawson, 80-84. 2. Attwater, 102. \n\n\n\nDemon \n\nFrom Greek daimon, a personal familiar spirit or guardian angel, like \nthe Roman genius, roughly synonymous with "soul." The daimon of a \nhero could undergo apotheosis, become a god, and rise to heaven to \ndwell among the stars. \n\nThe medieval concept of the demon evolved from Christians\' \nblanket condemnation of all pagan daimones, though they continued \nto believe implicitly in their existence. 1 Demons were usually consid- \nered messengers and assistants of a single Devil, in the same \nrelationship to him as angels to God. Yet they were also called "devils" \nand their master could be "the Demon." The terms were never \nclearly distinguished. \n\nAnimals and people could be "demons," or could harbor demons \nwithin their bodies or minds. Sometimes, any alien group of people \ncould be called demons. Europeans often visualized demons as black, \nlike Negroes. 2 On the other hand, dark-skinned people like the \nSinghalese maintained that demons were white and hairy.* \n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, all bad weather and natural \ncatastrophes were brought about by demons. He said, "It is a dogma \nof faith that demons can produce wind, storms, and rain of fire from \nheaven." Pope Eugene IV issued a bull against human "agents of \nSatan" who controlled weather-demons. Pope John XXII complained \nof wizards who tried to kill him through the agency of demons they \nsent into mirrors and rings. 4 \n\nThe church had several mutually contradictory theories about the \norigin of demons. One theory said they were the rebellious angels \nwho fell with Lucifer, before the creation of Adam and Eve, so the \nprinciple of evil was ready in the garden of Eden to play the tempter\'s \nrole. A second, incompatible theory said demons were created after \nhuman beings. They were begotten by the angels on the daughters of \nmen (Genesis 6:4). "The majority opinion about the fall of the angels, \nheld by St. Augustine and therefore accepted in the Middle Ages, \nwas that it had occurred before the creation of Adam, but some of the \nold notion that the angels had fallen through lust for the daughters of \nmen persisted to reinforce antifeminine prejudices." 5 \n\n\n\n221 \n\n\n\nDemon Some authorities, familiar with the pagans\' animal masks and \n\nanimal-headed idols, said demons were an animal-like race created \n^^^^^^^^^^^ separately by God, ahd readily incarnate in animal form. Black goats, \nbulls, cats, or dogs could be demons. The Gaelic uile-bheist (Yule- \nbeast, moon-calf) was called a demonic animal. St. Ambrose told of a \ncertain priest who exorcised the frogs in a certain marsh to stop them \nfrom croaking during mass. A thirteenth-century bishop of Lausanne \nexorcised all the eels in Lake Leman. 6 St. Augustine confidently \nasserted that demons help sorcerers to perform their magic, and have \nthe power to assume many animal shapes. 7 \n\nAt Basel in 1474, a rooster committed the unnatural crime of \nlaying an egg. It was decided that the bird possessed a demon, but \nexorcism failed to remove it. So the unfortunate rooster was solemnly \nsentenced to death by church authorities, and burned at the stake. 8 \n\nGreeks still believe in the half-horse demons, kallikantzari, de- \nscended from ancient centaurs and the shape-shifting horse-wizards \nof India, the kinnaras, "canterers" who used to live on the holy \nmoilntain of Mandara. 9 Their descendants perhaps founded the city \nof Kallipolis (Gallipoli). Their chief is still called the Lame Devil, \nrecalling lame Amazonian smith-gods like Hephaestus. Until recently \nit was thought any child born on Christmas Day would become a \nkalhkantzaros. w A cruel custom arose from this belief. Children born \non Christmas Day were carried to the market square, where their feet \nwere thrust into a fire until the toenails were singed. 11 The magical \npurpose of this may have been to destroy the horse-demons\' "hoofs." \n\nRecords of witch trials show that almost any kind of animal could \nbe perceived as a demon. Witches were executed because a neigh- \nbor\'s child was frightened by "the devil in the shape of a dog"; or \nbecause a man saw "a Thing like unto a rat" run out of a woman\'s \nhouse; or because a woman kept "two devils in the form of colts"; or be- \ncause a neighbor saw "the devil in the form of a toad" in a woman\'s \ngarden; or because a traveler saw "a Thing like a black cow" near the \nhouse of the accused; or because children heard a woman "talk to the \ndevil in the form of a frog." One woman was condemned because \nneighbors heard near her house at night a "foul yelling, like a number \nof cats." No one seems to have suggested that the yelling was in fact \ndone by cats, not demons. \n\nUrsula Kemp was hanged in 1 581 on the evidence of her own 8- \nyear-old son, who testified that she kept four demons: two cats, a \ntoad, and a black lamb. 12 Not once in the recorded trials did authorities \nquestion witnesses\' ability to distinguish these demons from ordinary \nanimals. It was taken for granted that anyone, even a small child, could \nrecognize His Satanic Majesty no matter how cleverly he disguised \nhimself as an apparently normal beast. \n\nSeveral popes were believed to have familiar demons of their own, \nparticularly the famous Honorius, long remembered as a magician. \nDuring the controversy between Pope Boniface VIII and Philip IV of \n\n\n\n222 \n\n\n\nFrance, the king held an assembly that formally deposed the pope Demon \n\nand presented evidence to prove that he was a sorcerer with a familiar \n\nspirit. 13 ^^_ ^_^____ \n\nSometimes, in the description of demons, imagination failed and \nhad to fall back on popular make-believe. One poor wretch named \nMargot de la Barre was burned at Paris in 1 391 for calling up a demon \n"in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit." Pressed \nto describe the demon under the stimulus of torture she could think \nof nothing better to say than that he had "the shape that demons take \nin Passion plays." 14 \n\nIt was often assumed that demons congregated especially in and \naround churches, for some inexplicable reason. Churches had to be \nexorcised at their dedication. Crosses were painted on the walls "to \nterrify the demons." 1S \n\nHouses were similarly protected by many crosses and crucifixes \nbut, nevertheless, harbored many demons, a belief that betrayed little \ntrust in the alleged powers of the crucifix. The custom of ringing church \nbells at the time of a death was supposed to drive away demons "who \nstood at the bed\'s foot, and about the house, ready to seize their prey, or \nat least to molest and terrify the soul in its passage, but by the ringing \nof that bell (for Durandus informs us evil spirits are much afraid of \nbells), they were kept aloof: and the soul, like a hunted hare, gained \nthe start." Tolling the church\'s largest bell commanded a higher price, \n"for that, being louder, the evil spirits must go farther off, to be clear \nof its sound, by which the poor Soul got so much more the start of \nthem." 16 \n\nBefore the witchcraft mania set in about the 12th and 1 3th \ncenturies, there was a general understanding that demons were \nnothing more than the old gods and goddesses, all of whom had animal \nincarnations of some kind. Christian fathers insisted that the pagan \ndeities were not figments of imagination, but real, living demons. \nLearned men even in the 19th century still believed this. Rawlinson, \nthe translator of Herodotus, was sure the oracle at Delphi was an evil \nspirit. 17 An early medieval baptismal formula demanded renunciation \nof "relations with the demon," defining the old religion as "works of the \ndemon, and all his words, and Thor, and Odin, and Saxnot, and all \nevil beings that are like them." 18 Such formalities were largely ignored. \nCenturies later, holiday dancers included personifications of the \nHorned God and the Scandinavian Julebuk (Yule Buck), which church- \nmen denounced as "the devil himself." 19 Monastic writers of the \n1 1th century spoke of many demons who constantly tempted people \naway from the church, showing them "delights and secrets, such as \nhow they might become immortal." 20 It was clear that they spoke of a \nrival religion. \n\nA Spanish Dominican, Raymond of Tarrega, said demons were \nuseful for punishing sinners in hell; like angels, demons performed \nGod\'s will. It was permissible to adore demons "so long as we adore, not \n\n\n\n223 \n\n\n\nDenis, Saint their evil, but their existence, which was given them by God. It is not \n\nDevi desirable to sacrifice to demons, but to do so is no more serious than \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ adoring an image of Christ or of the saints." 21 Later this opinion was \nrejected, and the Inquisition burned Raymond\'s book. \n\nI.

The teachings of Krishna or Shiva were ad- \ndressed to the Devi as interrogator of the catechism; she was also \naddressed as Dearly Beloved, the Shakti, a convention copied by the \nNew Testament. Krishna\'s virgin mother was her "maiden" form, \nDevaki. The Goddess\'s title as "the Way leading to the Gods" was \nDevayani, the Divine Yoni. As the virgin mother of Mahavira she \nwas Devananda, "Blessed Goddess." \' A Czech name for the Moon- \ngoddess, Devana, came from the same root, as also the Latin Diana, \n\n\n\n224 \n\n\n\ni% \n\n\n\nMinoan Diwija, Serbian Diiwica, and the Roman Diviana all mean- \ning "The Divinity." 2 \n\nI. Larousse, 347. 2. Thorsten, 361. \n\n\n\nDevil \n\n\n\nDevil \n\nThe words "devil" and "divinity" grew from the same root, Indo- \nEuropean devi (Goddess) or deva (God), which became daeva (devil) in \nPersian. 1 Old English divell (devil) can be traced to the Roman \nderivative divus, divi: gods. 2 Thus it seems that, from the beginning, \ngods and devils were often confused with one another. \n\nDivine and devilish were relative terms, as the primary sense of \nHebrew words for "good" and "evil" really meant "beneficial" and \n"hurtful." 3 Gods did "evil" things if angered; devils could do "good" \nthings if they were pleased. One man\'s god was his enemy\'s devil. \nArmenians used to sacrifice one sheep to Christ at Easter time and thirty \nsheep to the devil, on the theory that the devil\'s influence in the here \nand now was greater. 4 \n\nSuch thinking was not unusual. Devils were often credited with \nbeneficent magic. There was a devil who "maketh men witty, turneth \nall metals into the coin of the dominion, turneth water into wine, and \nwine into water, and blood into wine, and wine into blood, and a \nfool into a wise man and he leads 33 legions of demons." Another \ndevil "perfectly teaches the virtues of the stars, he transformeth men, \nhe giveth dignities, prelacies, and confirmations." Another devil "talketh \nof divine virtue, he giveth true answers of things present, past, and to \ncome, and of the divinity, and of the creation, he deceiveth none, nor \nsuffereth any to be tempted; he giveth dignities and prelacies." 5 \n\nEven early Christians admitted that the "devils" worshipped in \npagan temples were known to restore the sick to health. 6 Tertullian \nsaid, Diabolus simia Dei, the Devil imitates God; but in point of \nchronology there was some doubt about who was imitating whom. 7 \n\nJudeo-Christian tradition attributed many "diabolic" acts to God. \nHe was the sender of pestilence and famine. He created a terrible \nhell, and its demons, who tortured human souls on his orders. He \ncaused violent storms, which were (and still are) called "acts of God." \nFrom the 1 5 th century on, the church sold waxen cakes, the Agnus \nDei, stamped with a cross and advertised as sure protection against \nstorms and other "acts of God"; thus God was incongruously invoked to \ncombat himself. 8 \n\nGod even killed himself in the person of Christ, according to the \npieological dogma that they were one and the same. On the other \nBiand, some claimed Christ was killed by "devilish" Jews. Though Jews \n(were carrying out God\'s ordained scheme of salvation, and doing \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens \nTertullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Carthage \nof pagan parents. \n\n\n\n225 \n\n\n\nDevil God\'s will by executing Jesus, nevertheless theology exonerated God \n\nand blamed them. Though the Old Testament God did much "evil," \n^^^^^^^^^^ even destroying many thousands of his own helpless worshippers for \ntrivial offenses (1 Samuel 6:19), yet churchmen seldom dared to \naccept the Bible\'s own presentation of God as the maker of evil: "I form \nthe light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I the \nLord do all these things" (Isaiah 45:7). On the basis of this scripture, \nsome advanced the theory that God had deliberately created the devil \nbefore the beginning of the world, because a pre-existing evil principle \nwas necessary to "test the faith" of the future human race. 9 Yet \nsomehow, to make a devil was not evil if God did it. \n\nThe Persians believed God and the devil were twin brothers, born \nsimultaneously from the womb of the dualistic mother of Infinite \nTime, Zurvan. The devil (Ahriman) was cast down from heaven to the \nunderworld only because his sacrifice, like Cain\'s, was not acceptable \nto the older deity. The heavenly god (Ahura Mazda) continued to reign \nin the heights because he knew how to make the right sacrifices. \n\nBut the devil, not the god, was the true creator of the earth and all \ncreatures in the mundane world of matter. Thus the Magi prayed to \nhim for assistance in all worldly endeavors, and revered him as the \nsource of their magic powers. Ahriman was worshipped in Roman \ntimes throughout northern Europe, identified with all chthonian gods \nlike Pluto, Saturn, or Dis Pater. 10 In early Christian mystery-plays he \nappeared as a wonder-working spirit, one Saint Mahown. 11 \n\nThe Christian devil became a composite of ancient deities in a \nsingle Protean form. He had the goat-horns and hoofs of satyr-gods \nlike Pan, Marsyas, and Dionysus; the trident of Neptune, Hades, or \nShiva; the reptilian form of Leviathan, Python, or Ouroborus; the \nfiery form of Agni or Helios; the female breasts of Astarte-Ishtar; the \nwolf face of Dis, Feronius, or Fenrir; the quadruple wings of \nBabylonian cherubim; the bird claws of ancestral spirits, the aves; and all \nthe god-names Christians had ever heard, including many secret \nnames of their own God: Jupiter, Mercury, Minerva, Venus, Hades, \nPluto, Baal-Zebub, Lucifer, Zeus Chthonios, Sabazius, Belial, Ado- \nnis, Sabaoth, Iao, Soter, Emmanuel, Sammael. 12 The devil could take \nany shape, even a human one: Pope Gregory IX described him as "a \npale, black-eyed youth with a melancholy aspect." 1? At other times he \nwas an animal composite, as on the Amulet of Bes: \n\nNaked genius with the head of Bes, flanked by seven heads of animals \namong whom are bull, lion, and ibis, and surmounted by atef crown \nwith several horns; four wings; falcon-tail and crocodile-tail; four arms \ntwo arms stretched out along the wings hold lances and serpents, while \nthe third on the left seizes a lion, the fourth on the right holds sceptre and I \nwhip. The erect penis ends in a lionhead; there are lionmasks on the \nknees, the feet are given the form of jackal-heads with pointed ears and \nprolonged as coiled snakes. Bes stands on an ouroboros (cosmic \nserpent) which contains various animals: scorpion, crocodile, tortoise. M I \n\n\n\n226 \n\n\n\nThe devil\'s popular nickname Old Scratch came from a Germanic Devil \n\nwood-spirit called a Scrat or Waldscrat, sometimes a protector of \n\nhouseholds known as Schraetlin or "little Scrat." The spirit inhabited \n\na phallic amulet based on the bisexual lingam-yoni, as suggested by \nAnglo-Saxon scritta, Old English scrat, a hermaphrodite. Another \nnickname of the devil, Deuce, came from Gaulish gods called Dusii, a \nvariation oldeus, "god." Again there was a hermaphroditic connota- \ntion, since "deuce" also meant "two." 15 \n\nSome demonologists postulated seven devils, one for each of the \nseven deadly sins: Lucifer (pride), Mammon (avarice), Asmodeus \n(lechery), Satan (anger), Beelzebub (gluttony), Leviathan (envy) and \nBelphegor (sloth). Belial, a slightly less prestigious spirit, governed \nsuch "vessels of iniquity" as playing cards and dice. 16 \n\n"Devils" and "the devil" were interchangeable. The devil was \none, and also many: a monotheistic transformation of a polytheistic \nconcept. Christian nations asserted that all other nations worshipped \n"devils" or "the devil" under many names. A 16th-century list of \ndevil-worshipping countries included: Tartary, China, Lapland, Fin- \nland, the Northern Islands, the East Indies, Persia, Arabia, Anatolia, \nEgypt, Ethiopia, Turkey, Russia, and Norway. 17 According to the 18th- \ncentury German theologian Johann Beaumont, any person anywhere \nin the world who "confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh" \nbelongs to the devils. 18 \n\nAs God incarnated himself in earthly flesh, so the devil was \nsupposed to incarnate himself in earthly flesh shortly before the \ncoming of doomsday. This demonic being was usually called Antichrist. \nHe would be known by his Christlike ability to perform healing \nmiracles, such as restoring sight to the blind. 19 It was never explained \nhow these demonic miracles were to be distinguished from holy ones. \nThe coming of Antichrist was constantly announced, dozens of times in \nj each century. Canon Moreau and contemporary churchmen report- \ned that Antichrist was born in 1 599 at Babylon, where the Jews \nacclaimed him as their Messiah. 20 Apparently he was identified with \nthe Messianic Elijah for whom the Jews looked each year at Passover. \n\nIf there were any devilish attributes on which most myths agreed, \nthey were the rather godlike qualities of (1) superhuman intelligence, \nand (2) superhuman sexuality. Inquisitor Jean Bodin wrote, "It is \ncertain that the devils have a profound knowledge of all things. No \ntheologian can interpret the Holy Scriptures better than they can; no \nlawyer has more detailed knowledge of testaments, contracts and \nactions; no physician or philosopher can better understand the composi- \ntion of the human body, and the virtues of the heavens, the stars, \nbirds and fishes, trees and herbs, metals and stones." Inquisitor Nicholas \nRemy said the devil had complete knowledge of everything human \nbeings could not explain. "Everything which is unknown lies ... in the \ncursed domain of demonology; for there are no unexplained facts. \nWhatever is not normal is due to the Devil." 21 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n227 \n\n\n\nDevil No Christian was permitted to disbelieve in the devil. His credibility \n\nrested on the same foundation as that of God. Indeed, the very \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m concept of salvation depended on the devil. If there had been no \nTempter, there was no original sin, no fall, no hell, no need of a \nredeemer or a church. De Givry correctly said, "If the Satanic concept \nis tampered with, the whole edifice laboriously erected by the Fathers \nof the Church crumbles to the ground." 22 \n\nThe devil was essential to the dualistic theology that Christianity \ncopied from Persia. If the world was divided between the forces of \ngood and evil, an evil deity was necessary, otherwise evil would have to \nbe blamed on God. Logically, a god couldn\'t be both all-good and all- \npowerful. If God could make a world without evil, and would not, he \ncouldn\'t be all-good. If God wanted to make a world without evil, \nand could not, he couldn\'t be all-powerful. The only solution not a \ngood one, but the only possible one was to supply God with an \nevenly matched adversary, to be responsible for evil. Thus theologians \nthought it the worst heresy, "contrary to the true faith," to suggest \nthat devils existed only in the ignorant imagination. 23 The devil was so \nreal to Martin Luther that he accosted him one evening and threw an \ninkpot at him. 24 \n\nIt was a severe theological problem to account for God\'s apparent \nhelplessness to halt the devil\'s activity. Though Lucifer or Satan was \nsupposed to have been utterly defeated and immobilized during the \nfamous War in Heaven, yet he was so lively that the War seemed to \nhave caused him nothing more than a momentary inconvenience. \nTheologians could only propose that God "permitted" the devil\'s \nfreedom of action. They said, "It is not the witch\'s ointment nor her \nincantation that makes her forked stick fly through the air, but the \npower of the devil, allowed by God." 25 They never explained why the \nchurch punished what God allowed. \n\nMuch semantic hairsplitting went into defining relationships be- \ntween the devil, God, and humanity, such as the distinction between \nsorcery and witchcraft. Sorcery was evoking spirits to "carry out those \npowers which God permitted the Devil." Witchcraft was evoking \nspirits to "commit acts against His ruling." In practice, a man who asked \nthe devil to help him seduce a woman was not guilty of any crime, \nbecause sex was under the devil\'s jurisdiction, by God\'s order. Devils \nwho killed children did nothing sinful, for God permitted them to kill \nchildren "in order to punish their parents." 26 On the other hand, a \nwoman who tried to save her dying child with witch-herbs was \nmortally guilty and deserved the death penalty. 27 \n\nTheologians argued that all works of witches were brought about \nby the devil with God\'s permission. Even a witch who did only good \nworks, like healing the sick, must suffer the same death as a witch whose \nacts were harmful. 28 Thus witches were placed in a no-win situation. \nOnce a man beat a witch for casting a spell on his son, and forced her to \nremove the spell. Pope Benedict XIV ruled that the witch committed \n\n\n\n228 \n\n\n\na double sin by using the devil\'s power twice, even though she did it \nunder coercion the second time. Benedict carefully stipulated that the \nman who beat her was entirely innocent of wrongdoing. 29 \n\nThe church created the idea that witches were the devil\'s helpers, \ninvolved in a vast plot to undermine Christian society. This theory \nwas the real root of the witch mania. The people were generally \nindifferent to the priests\' witch-hunting until this theory was forced \non them by propaganda from the pulpit, which deliberately played on \ntheir fear of the devil after stimulating it in the first place. 50 \n\nIt sometimes happened that churchmen themselves consulted the \ndevil, without paying the same penalties they inflicted on lay persons. \nSome miracle-working heretics were convicted by the bishop of Besan- \ncon in 1 1 70, on the evidence of none other than Satan, interviewed \nby the bishop with the help of a priest skilled in necromancy. Satan \nassured the bishop that the accused were indeed his servants, so they \nwere sent to the stake. 31 \n\nThe devil was useful to clergymen or anyone else seeking an \nexcuse for lecherous behavior. According to one story: \n\nThe devil transformed himself into the appearance of St. Silvanus, Bishop \nof Nazareth, a friend of St. Jerome. And this devil approached a noble \nwoman by night in her bed and began first to provoke and entice her with \nlewd words, and then invited her to perform the sinful act. And when \nshe called out, the devil in the form of the saintly Bishop hid under the \nwoman \'s bed, and being sought for and found there, he in lickerish \nlanguage declared lyingly that he was Bishop Silvanus. On the morrow \ntherefore, when the devil had disappeared, the holy man was scandal- \nously defamed. 32 \n\nSome sly fellows used the devil to defraud. There was a \nCornishman who convinced his neighbors that he had sold his soul to \nthe devil. Taking a few coins to the tavern each night, he pretended \nto receive money from the devil to pay for his drink. He would thrust his \nhat up the chimney, calling on his diabolic friend; and the coins \nappeared in his hat. The superstitious innkeeper wouldn\'t touch the \ndevil\'s money, so the Cornishman drank all evening for free. 35 \n\nThe devilish pact was not a joke, however; it was an essential \ningredient of the devil-mythology that killed millions during six \ncenturies of witch-hunting. Yet it was logically absurd. If the devil \nreceived the soul of every sinner, as the church taught, he had no \nneed to secure it with a "pact"; it would be his anyway. As for the \nsinners themselves, they seemed to derive little benefit from their side \nof the contract, as Scot pointed out: any woman in her right mind would \nreject the devil\'s bargain, saying, "Why should I hearken to you, \nwhen you will deceive me? Did you not promise my neighbor Mother \nDutton to save and rescue her; and yet lo she is hanged?" 34 \n\nEarly in the Christian era there were no very severe punishments \nfor making a pact with the devil. The Golden Legend tells of a young \nman who signed over his soul to the devil to win the love of a certain \n\n\n\nDevil \n\n\n\n\n\n\n229 \n\n\n\nDevil lady. Later, St. Basil prayed over the young man and retrieved his \n\ncontract, a piece of paper which dropped from an upper balcony of the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ church, "fluttered down through the air and fell into his hands, in the \nsight of all." The paper was torn up and the youth set free. 55 \n\nSeveral popes were said to have made a diabolic pact, including \none who may have ideological roots in a genuine pagan tradition: \nSilvester II. His real name was Gerbert de Aurillac. He grew up in a \nFrance still permeated by Dianic and druidic fairy-religion, where \nAphrodite was worshipped at Rouen up to the 12th century, and the \nMoon-goddess\'s groves attracted pilgrims up to the 14th. Silvester \nchose a papal name meaning "spirit of the grove," and it was said he \nhad a fairy mistress named Meridiana (Mary-Diana), who taught him \nthe secrets of magic. 36 According to Cardinal Benno and William of \nMalmesbury, Silvester signed a pact with the devil to achieve the \npapal throne, and the devil gave it to him. 37 \n\nThe truth about Pope Silvester was that he had unusually intellec- \ntual tastes for his time. He remarked that, for the frustrations and \ndifficulties of his life, "philosophy was the only cure." 38 In his time, \n"philosophy" didn\'t mean Christian theology. It meant pagan litera- \nture, natural science, and Hermetism. \n\nThe list of great wen in those centuries charged with magic . . . is \nastounding; it includes every man of real mark, and in the midst of \nthem stands one of the most thoughtful popes, Silvester II (Gerbert), and \nthe foremost of medieval thinkers on natural science, Albert the Great. \nIt came to be the accepted idea that, as soon as a man conceived a wish to \nstudy the works of God, his first step must be a league with the devil. 39 \n\nAnother "devilish" philosopher was Heinrich Cornelius Agrip- \npa von Nettesheim, historiographer to Emperor Charles V, author of \nthe famous treatise on Hermetism, De occulta philosophia. The \nchurch execrated his works and severely reprimanded him for trying to \ndefend accused witches, but his wealthy patrons protected him from \narrest: only once he was imprisoned for debt, not heresy. 40 He called \nmagic the perfect science, and implied as the Gnostic heretics did \nthat knowledge came to man not as a gift of God but as a gift of the \ndevil. \n\nAgrippa\'s life story contributed to the legend of Faust, around \nwhich centered many thrilling tales of the devil\'s pact. The real Faust \nwas not impressive. As an obscure schoolmaster in Kreuznach, he was \ndismissed from his post in 1 507 on a charge of sodomy. 41 Six years \nlater he reappeared as an astrologer and soothsayer calling himself the \nDemigod of Heidelberg. Later, citizens of Munster knew him as "the \nfamous necromancer, Dr. Faustus." Ultimately, his fame rested not on \nany of his doings but on the so-called Faustian books, Hb\'llenzwange, \n"Harrowings of Hell," which he didn\'t write. These anonymous works \ngrew into a large body of literature professing to tell the reader how to \nmake a pact with the devil, work magic, find buried treasure, win love \nand fortune, and finally renounce the pact in time to save one\'s soul. \n\n\n\n230 \n\n\n\nPredictably, such books were enormously popular. Two books really \nwritten by Agrippa von Nettesheim to win the favor of Margaret of \nAustria, The Superiority of Women and The Nobility of the Female \nSex, were declared heretical and forbidden publication by the clergy. 42 \n\nMagic books nearly always gave formulae for negotiating with the \ndevil. Le Dragon Rouge told the aspiring wizard to address "Emper- \nor Lucifer, master of all the rebellious spirits," and his ministers \nLucifuge Rofocale, Prince Beelzebub, and Count Ashtoreth. 4B Mag- \nic Papyri that had been early models for these books often confused the \nnames and attributes of Jehovah and Lucifer, speaking of "God the \nlight-bringer (Lucifer), invincible, who knoweth what is in the heart of \nall life, who of the dust hath formed the race of men." 44 We have \nseen the same kind of confusion in Christian theology itself. Yet in \n14th-century Toulouse, witches were burned for saying what was \nactually a tenet of the church\'s dualism: that "God and the Devil were \ncompletely equal, the former reigning over the sky and the latter the \nearth; all souls which the Devil managed to seduce were lost to the \nMost High God and lived perpetually on earth or in the air." 45 \n\nEven up to the 20th century, churchmen insisted on the devilish \npact. Father Thurston wrote: "In the face of Holy Scripture and the \nteaching of the Fathers and theologians the abstract possibility of a pact \nwith the Devil and of a diabolical interference in human affairs can \nhardly be denied." 46 But the Fathers and theologians never explained \nhow the devil could profit from the pact, other than to receive a \n"soul" that was his anyway. As Samuel Butler said, no one heard the \ndevil\'s side of any story, because God wrote all the books. 47 \n\nOne might think an "enlightened" modern society would have \ngiven up the idea of the devil. But a poll taken in 1978 showed "two \nout of five Americans believe in devils." 48 The strange viability of devils \nmay arise from their usefulness in assuaging the guilt of God and \nman. "Both Judaism and Christianity have maintained that God must \nbe given the credit for all the goodness in human history, and that \nmen must take the blame for all the evil." 49 Thus, the real purpose of \nthe devil was to take some of this heavy responsibility off frail human \nshoulders. In short: the devil, not Christ, was the true scapegoat who \nassumed the burden of men\'s sins. \n\n1. Larousse, 317. 2. Scot, 444. 3. Tennant, 13. 4. Briffault 2, 564. \n\n5. Scot, 323-25. 6. J.H.

Her true spirit moved within and behind these things, unseen. \nThrough the life of the universe she constantly arranged and re- \narranged the outward manifestations of her "order" to make infinite \nnumbers of different living forms. At doomsday she destroyed them \nall, to begin over with the next creation. See Tohu Bohu. \n\n1. Lindsay, O.A., 75, 120. \n\n\n\nDiamond \n\nLiterally, "World-Goddess." The ancients used to believe gem \nstones were solidified drops of the divine essence, embedded in rocks \nwhen the world was created. Diamonds were sacred to the Mother of \nthe gods because they "ruled" all other stones by their superior \nhardness. In Tantric Tibet, the divine essence of the Earth-goddess \nTara is still assumed to inhabit her human incarnation, the Diamond \nSow, traditional consort or feminine counterpart of the Dalai Lama. \n\nBecause diamonds were sacred to the supreme Goddess, they were \ntaken over by the cult of the Virgin; and because of this association \nwith virginity they came to be considered appropriate betrothal gifts. In \nthe transition from Tarot cards to modern playing cards, diamonds \nreplaced the ancient suit of pentacles, which were symbols of Mother \nEarth (Tara) and of the feminine earth element. \n\n\n\n232 \n\n\n\ni \n\n\n\nDiana \n\n"Queen of Heaven," Roman name for the Triple Goddess as (1) \nLunar Virgin, (2) Mother of Creatures, and (3) the Huntress (Destroy- \ner). Her Greek name was Artemis. Her major pilgrimage centers \nwere Ephesus and Nemi, the Sacred Grove. She was Dione, Diana \nNemorensis, or Nemetona, Goddess of the Moon-grove. In her \nsanctuaries, sacred kings periodically engaged in combat, the loser dying \nas the god Hippolytus, the winner invested as the Goddess\'s new \nfavorite, Virbius. See Hippolytus, Saint. \n\nAs Diana Egeria, patroness of childbirth, nursing, and healing, the \nGoddess made Nemi\'s holy spring the Lourdes of pagan Rome. 1 The \nlegendary King Numa was said to have derived all his wisdom from a \nsacred marriage with her. \n\nDiana\'s cult was so widespread in the pagan world that early \nChristians viewed her as their major rival, which is why she later \nbecame "Queen of Witches." The Gospels commanded total destruc- \ntion of all temples of Diana, the Great Goddess worshipped by "Asia \nand all the world" (Acts 19:27). \n\nRoman towns all over Europe habitually called the local mother \ngoddess Diana, as later Christian towns were to call her Madonna. \nFortunatus said Diana was the Goddess worshipped at Vernemeton, \n"which in the Gaulish language means the Great Shrine." In the 5th \ncentury a.d., the Gauls regarded her as their supreme deity. Christians \nspoke slightingly of their pagan custom of adoring the spirit of Diana \nin a cut branch or a log of wood. 2 Gozbert, a 7th-century Frankish \nchieftain, doubted the claims of a Christian missionary on the ground \nthat the Christian God was "no better than our own Diana." 3 \n\nAt Ephesus, the Goddess was called Mother of Animals, Lady of \nWild Creatures, and Many-Breasted Artemis, shown with her entire \ntorso covered with breasts to nourish the world\'s creatures. 4 In the 4th \ncentury a.d., the church took over this shrine and re-dedicated it to \nthe virgin Mary. 5 One of the earliest churches devoted to "Our Lady" \nexisted at Ephesus in 43 1 ; but most of the people believed the Lady \nwas Diana, not Mary. In 432 the Council of Ephesus tried to eliminate \nworship of the pagan Goddess, but the bishops were besieged by \ncrowds demanding, "Give us our Diana of the Ephesians!" 6 \n\nAn excuse for converting Diana\'s temples into Mary\'s churches \nwas provided by a made-to-order legend that Mary lived at Ephesus \nin her old age. Her tomb was located there, and some Christians even \npointed out the house in which she had lived. 7 But sometimes she \nwas identified with the sinister Widow of Ephesus, a Crone aspect of \nthe Goddess showing some primitive features. \n\nPetronius\'s version of the myth said the Widow hung her hus- \nband\'s dead body on one of the three crosses in front of Diana\'s \ntemple, replacing the body of a previously crucified thief. Then she lay \nwith her new lover at the foot of the cross. 8 The parallel between this \nimage and that of the triple Mary at the foot of Jesus\'s cross was too \n\n\n\nDiana \n\n\n\nVenantius Honorius \nClementianus \nFortunatus 6th- \ncentury poet, bishop of \nPoitiers, still venerated \nas a saint in France. \n\n\n\n233 \n\n\n\nDiana close for comfort, especially since Diana herself was assimilated to the \n\nChristian myth as Mary\'s mother, or elder self, the "Grandmother of \n^^^^^^^^^^^ God" under the name of either Anna (Hannah) or Di-anna \n(Dinah). 9 \n\nGnostic Christians called their Wisdom-goddess Sophia the same \nGrandmother of God, and frequently identified her with Diana of \nEphesus. When Diana\'s temple was finally pulled down, as the Gospels \nordered, its magnificent porphyry pillars were carried to Constantino- \nple and built into the church of Holy Sophia. 10 \n\nThe magic of Ephesus was remembered through the Middle Ages. \nA writer said in 1725: "It is recorded in divers authors that in the \nimage of Diana, which was worshipped at Ephesus, there were certain \nobscure words or sentences . . . written upon the feet, girdle and \ncrown of the said Diana: the which, if a man did use, having written \nthem out, and carrying them about him, he should have good luck in \nall his businesses." 11 \n\nSome Christians even remembered that Diana was once the triple \ndeity who ruled the world. A 14th-century poem attributed to the \nBishop of Meaux said Diana was an old name for the Trinity. 12 \n\nOfficers of the Inquisition however regarded Diana as the "God- \ndess of the heathen" with whom witches made their aerial night \njourneys or thought they did. 13 The worship of Diana was denounced \nwherever it was found, even when the worshippers were members of \nthe clergy. In the 14th century, a bishop found the monks of Frithel- \nstock Priory worshipping a statue of "the unchaste Diana" at an altar \nin the woods, and made them destroy it. 14 The notorious inquisitor \nTorquemada declared bluntly that Diana is the devil. 15 \n\nDevil or not, Diana ruled the wild forests of Europe through the \nmedieval period. As patron of the forest of Ardennes she was Dea \nArduenna; as patron of the Black Forest she was Dea Abnoba. 16 \nSerbians, Czechs, and Poles knew her as the woodland Moon- \ngoddess Diiwica, Devana, or Dziewona. 17 She remained the Goddess \nof wild woodlands and hunting, all the way up to the 18th century in \nEngland. \n\nDianic rites were celebrated even in church, despite objections \n\nfrom the clergy. A minister wrote against the traditional parade of a \n\nstag\'s head into St. Paul\'s Cathedral in London: "bringing in procession \n\ninto the church the head of a deer, fixed on the top of a long spear or \n\npole, with the whole company blowing Hunters Horns in a sort of \n\nhideous manner; and with this rude pomp they go up to the High \n\nAltar, and offer it there. You would think them all the mad Votaries of \n\nDiana." 18 \n\nl.Frazer,G.B.,5,10. 2. Graves, W.G., 273-74. 3. Reinach, 153. \n\n4. Neumann, G.M., pi. 35. 5. Ashe, 185. 6. Legman, 661. 7.

As Dido-Anna she was the consort \nof the Tyrian god Melek-Heracles, who died by fire as a sacrificial \nvictim each year. According to Roman myth, Dido chose Aeneas as her \nsacred king and was going to sacrifice him, but he escaped and fled, \nleaving her to perish in his place. He survived to become the founder of \nRome. \n\nAnother of Dido\'s names was Elissa, "the Goddess." \n\n\n\nDike var. Dice \n\nAlternative spelling of the Greek Fate-goddess Tyche, whom the \nOrphics called Eurydice, "Universal Dike."

They sought an honest man because \nthey believed they were living in the last age of the world, and the \nGoddess would destroy it when there was not one honest man still living \n\nSin it. \nThis matched the Oriental concept of the Kali Yuga, last age of \nI the world, when men become callous, violent, disorderly, and dishon- \norable. 2 When these conditions were completely fulfilled, doomsday \nwas imminent. \n\nThe word "cynical" descended from the implication that, despite \nI Diogenes\'s lifelong search, he never found the one honest man \nwhose existence still prevented the earth\'s destruction.

His only fault was that he never existed. \n\nDionysius\'s works were forged about the 6th century a.d. and \npalmed off as the work of one Dionysius the first bishop of Athens, \nsupposedly converted to Christianity by St. Paul personally, during the \nlatter\'s spirit-visit to Greece as a ghost, after having been "caught up \nto the third heaven." Paul told pseudo-Dionysius about heaven, and \npseudo-Dionysius wrote it down and preached it from the Athenian \nHill of Ares; hence his title, Areopagite. \n\nThe medieval church based its organization of three sacraments, \nthree holy orders, and three lower orders on the spurious revelations \nof Dionysius, in imitation of the heavenly hierarchy he described, \nconsisting of (1) Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones; (2) Dominions, \nVirtues, and Powers; (3) Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. The \nspirits of heaven remained thus organized all the way up to the 18th \ncentury. \n\nChurchmen reluctantly abandoned their belief in the authenticity \nof Dionysius\'s writings when it was pointed out that, despite earlier \nscholars\' unquestioning acceptance, they failed the simplest of chrono- \nlogical tests, constantly referring to events and institutions of much \nlater date than the time of the alleged Dionysius. 1 At first the pious tried \nto pretend these references were miraculous prophecies of the future, \nbut this defense proved untenable. \n\n1. White 2, 315-16. \n\n\n\nDionysus \n\nIdentified with many other savior-gods, Dionysus was also called \nBacchus, Zagreus, Sabazius, Adonis, Antheus, Zalmoxis, Pentheus, \nPan, Liber Pater, or "the Liberator." l His totem was a panther (Pan- \nthereos, the Beast of Pan). His emblem was the thyrsus, a phallic scepter \ntipped with a pine cone. His priestesses were the Maenads, or \nBacchantes, who celebrated his orgies with drunkenness, nakedness, and \nsacramental feasting. \n\nDionysus is often presented as a rustic wine-god, inventor of \nviniculture. He was more than that. He was a prototype of Christ, \nwith a cult center at Jerusalem as well as nearly every other major city in \nthe middle east. Plutarch said the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was \ncelebrated in his honor: "I think that the festival of the Sabbath is not \nwholly without relation to the festival of Dionysus." 2 He added that \nthe Jews abstain from pork because their god Dionysus-Adonis (Lord \nDionysus) was slain by a boar. In the 1st century B.C. the Jews \nthemselves claimed to worship Dionysus under his Phrygian name of \nZeus Sabazius. 5 \n\nTacitus said Dionysus Liber was the god of Jerusalem in a former \n\n\n\n236 \n\n\n\ntime, but a different god had replaced him, a god with less attractive Dionysus \n\ncharacteristics: "Liber established a festive and cheerful worship, while \n\nthe Jewish religion is tasteless and mean." 4 Dionysus and Jehovah \n\nwere literally two sides of the same coin in the 5th century B.C., when ^\'"\'^^^^^^^^ \n\ncoins found near Gaza showed Dionysus on one side, and on the \n\nother a bearded figure labeled JHWH Jehovah. 5 \n\nIn Lebanon, Dionysus was incarnated in Ampelus, a "beautiful \nyouth" torn to pieces by a bull and reincarnated as a grapevine. In \nChios, the blood of men murdered by Dionysus\'s Maenads was used to \nfertilize the vines. At Orchomenus, the Triple Goddess appeared in \nDionysian rites as "three princesses" who tore apart a male child and ate \nhim (the earth absorbing sacrificial blood). In Thebes, a king named \nPentheus dared to oppose the Dionysian cult, perhaps because he didn\'t \ncare to die like other Dionysian god-kings. But the women tore him \nto pieces anyway, led by the king\'s own mother (or mother-goddess), \nwho wrenched his head off. 6 Later Theban rites of Dionysus cen- \ntered on killing and eating a fawn named Pentheus, and the Maenads \nwore fawn skins. The god\'s Lydian totem was a fox, Bassareus, \nforerunner of the medieval Reynard. There the Maenads called them- \nselves Bassarids, and wore fox skins. 7 \n\nThese darker legends show Dionysus\'s typical "savior" pattern: \nfirst and most primitive, a king killed and cannibalized to provide both \nthe earth and women\'s wombs with fructifying blood; then a surrogate \nfor the king, a condemned criminal or a young man chosen by lot; \nthen an animal substitute for the man; and finally, "flesh" and "blood" \ndevoured in the form of bread and wine, the classical Dionysian \nsacrament at Eleusis. \n\nIn Palestine, Dionysus was identified with Noah, the first biblical \npatriarch to get drunk (Genesis 9:21). His Greek title was Deucalion, \n"New-wine sailor," the flood hero in pre-Hellenic myths. 8 Dionysus \nwas also a form of Adam, offspring of Father Heaven and Mother \nEarth (Zeus and Demeter), torn to pieces to make a sin offering of the \n"wine" of his blood. 9 His later hero-incarnation Orpheus, star of the \npopular Orphic Mysteries, was the same sacrificial god, torn to pieces by \nthe Maenads. Proclus said, "Orpheus, because he was the principal in \nthe Dionysian rites, is said to have suffered the same fate as the god." 10 \n\nOrpheus was a third-generation savior, identified with his divine \n[father Dionysus as Dionysus was identified with his divine father \nZeus. Seated on the Heavenly Father\'s throne, brandishing his light- \nning-scepter, Dionysus was hailed as King of Kings and God of \nGods. 11 He was also the god-begotten, virgin-born Anointed One \nUChristos) whose mother seems to have been all three forms of the \nTriple Goddess: the earth mother, Persephone the underworld queen, \nSemele the moon-maiden. Hints of a hanging or crucifixion ceremo- \nny appeared in his sacrificial title Dendrites, "Young Man of the \n[Tree." 12 He was also a Horned God, with such forms as bull, goat, \nand stag. \n\nAccording to the classic story of his dismemberment, the god took \n\n237 \n\n\n\nDionysus \n\n\n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and \ngeographer of the 2nd \ncentury a.d. Living in \na time of declining \nculture, he was \ninspired by a desire to \ndescribe the ancient \nsacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nsuch animal forms in rapid succession to avoid the onslaught of the \nTitans (pre-Hellenic earth-deities), who eventually caught him, tore \nhim to pieces, and devoured him. They trapped his soul in a mirror \nwhile he was admiring his reflection, which equates Dionysus with the \nspring-flower god Narcissus, another of his many disguises. Accord- \ning to Pausanias, it was Onomakritos who made the Titans into \n"authors of Dionysus\'s sufferings," but the orgia had not included \nthis detail of old. Probably one of the god\'s oldest forms was Dionysus \nMelanaigis, "Dionysus of the Black Goatskin," a scapegoat-satyr like \nMarsyas. 13 His traditional costume contributed much to the medieval \nChristian notion of the devil\'s habit of appearing in the form of a \nblack goat. \n\nAt Eleusis, the place of his "Advent," Dionysus appeared as a \nnewborn Holy Child laid in a winnowing-basket, liknon, from which \nhe was called Dionysus Liknites. This sacred object, his cradle, was \ncarried in his processions by a special functionary called a likno- \nphoros, cradle-bearer. 14 The liknon was the original form of the \n"manger" in which the infant Jesus was laid. All grain-gods, whose \nflesh was eaten in the form of bread, appeared as newborn babes in a \nvessel intended for seed corn. \n\nA long-remembered incarnation of the god was King Dionysus of \n\nSyracuse, who altered the custom of king-sacrifice in the 4th century \n\nB.C. When the time of his immolation approached, King Dionysus \n\nsubstituted for himself a courtier who was called Damocles, meaning \n\neither "Conquering Glory" or "Glory of Blood." Damocles was said to \n\nhave volunteered to take the king\'s place because he envied the \n\nprivileges of kingship. He enjoyed these privileges for a short while, but \n\nsoon discovered a sword suspended above his head by a single hair: \n\nsymbol of the fate of kings, in a time when they and the gods they \n\nembodied were periodically fated to die. 15 See Kingship. \n\n1.

Each wore \nhis half of the egg shell as a cap or crown. The twins were named \nCastor and Polydeuces, the latter meaning "abundant wine," perhaps a \nreference to the flowing blood of the solar Savior whom the twins \nushered in and out of the underworld in rites linked with fertility. 1 The \nname of Castor has been associated with the rite of castrating the god, \nin classical paganism defined as "the act of offering the phallus to the \nLove Goddess." 2 \n\n\n\n238 \n\n\n\nThe Love Goddess was called Venus in Rome, and her planet is Diotima \n\nthe same one that appears as both morning and evening "star." Djsj r \n\nPerhaps this was why Christians associated Pollux, the Roman form of \n\nPolydeuces, with "pollution." Like Shaher and Shalem in the land of \nCanaan, the Heavenly Twins announced the daily birth of the sun with \nthe words "He is risen," and sent him into the underworld at his daily \ndeath with the word "Peace" (Shalom, or Salaam). See Lucifer. \n\nTo Mithraic sun-worshippers the Dioscuri were symbolized by \ntwo golden stars, which still appear in the heavens as the Alpha and \nBeta stars of the constellation Gemini (the Twins). When the Dioscuri \nwere shown in anthropomorphic form in Mithraic shrines, they held \nspears or torches, one upward, the other downward, signifying the rising \nand setting directions of the sun. Their pose was standard: one twin \nhad the right leg crossed over the left, the other had the left leg crossed \nover the right. 3 The same "magic 4" leg position is seen on the \nEmperor card of the Tarot trumps. The Dioscuri were revered in \nSparta as horsemen, warriors, and war dancers. \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1, 249; 2, 406. 2. Jobes, 179. 3.

In Britain, Dis was regarded as a universal deity very like Jehovah, \nwhose later adherents, however, transformed Dis into an alternative \nname for the devil. 2 \n\n1 . Umusse, 211. 2.

Mohammedans viewed the \ndjinn as pagan semi-demons because they were connected with the \nOld Religion. See Genius. \n\n\n\nDog \n\nNo one knows when man first domesticated the dog. Evidence \nsuggests that "man" didn\'t do it at all; woman did it. In myth, dogs \naccompanied only the Goddess, guarding the gates of her after-world, \nhelping her to receive the dead. \n\nLike other carrion eaters e.g., vultures dogs, wolves, and jack- \nals were associated with funerary customs. Dogs carried the dead to \ntheir Mother. In Iran, even after it became usual to bury the dead, it was \nthought necessary to let dogs tear the corpse before burial, a survival \nof the older practice. 1 The Vendidad said the soul enroute to heaven \nwould meet the Goddess with her dogs: "Then comes the beautiful, \nwell-shapen, strong and graceful maid, with the dogs at her sides, one \nwho can discern, who has many children, happy and of high \nunderstanding. She makes the soul of the righteous go up above." 2 \n\nSemitic tradition transformed the Goddess into the Angel of \nDeath, whose approach can be seen only by dogs which is why \ndogs howl at the moon to announce a death. 3 Devonshire folklore still \nsays there is a dog in the moon who acts as a messenger of death. 4 \nThe Irish say two dogs guard the gate of death, which used to lead to \nEmania, the Moon-land; mourners were enjoined not to wail too \nloudly, lest they disturb the dogs and cause them to attack the soul at the \ngate. This and many other similar images can be traced to the ancient \nVedic concept of the moon as death\'s gate, ruled by the Goddess and \nguarded by her two dogs. 5 \n\n\n\n240 \n\n\n\n\'*ty \n\n\n\nThis Oriental symbol is still seen in an almost pure form on Tarot \ntrump #18, the card of the Moon. The conventional picture is of two \ndogs howling at the full moon in front of a gate, or two pylons, with a \nroad leading between them to a distant horizon. The scene was \nusually interpreted as having to do with death. 6 Sometimes the card was \ncalled Hecate, after the classic death-goddess whose totemic compan- \nions were dogs. 7 Her gates were guarded by the three-headed hound \nCerberus, "Spirit of the Pit." 8 In Celtic myth the gatekeeper was a \ndog named Dormarth, "Death\'s Door." 9 The same dog might be seen \non the famous Gundestrup Cauldron, guarding the yonic gate \nthrough which heroes pass on their way to death and transfiguration. 10 \n\nAccording to the Vedic tradition, the Bitch-goddess Sarama was \nthe mistress of the death dogs, and a divine huntress like Artemis, \nDiana, Anath, and other western versions of the lunar maiden. 11 \nAncient Babylon knew her as Gula, the Fate-goddess, whose symbol \nwas a dog. 12 She was assimilated to Ishtar, whose sacred king Tammuz \nwas torn to pieces by "dogs." B Under his Greek names of Adonis or \nActaeon, he was torn to pieces by the Dogs of Artemis. As the savior \nOrpheus, he was incarnated in Neanthus of Lesbos and torn to pieces \nin the Orphic temple by "dogs. " H When Athene assumed the guise of \nthe death-goddess, her priestesses filled her temple with canine \n"howlings" (houloi), like wolves or dogs singing to the moon. 15 Some- \ntimes a whole pack of dogs or priestesses? hunted souls in the \nrealm of death, like the Celtic Hounds of Annwn, which Christians \nsoon converted into the Hounds of Hell. 16 \n\nOriginally this meant the hounds of the Goddess Hel, ruler of the \nland of death. Norse myth said she gave birth to lunar wolf-dogs who \nate the flesh of the dead and carried souls to paradise. Their leader was \nManagarm, "Moon-Dog." The Prose Edda says Managarm was \n"gorged with the flesh of the death-doomed; and with red blood he \nreddens the dwelling of the gods." 17 In other words, he carried the \ndead away in primitive, carrion-eating canine fashion. \n\nAn alternative name for the Norse moon-dogs\' mother was Angur- \nboda, the Hag of the Iron Wood: an older version of Hel, sometimes \ncalled Hel\'s mother. 18 Two of Angurboda\'s canine children, Geri and \nFreki, lived in Valhalla and ate the food offered on "Odin\'s table," \nmeaning the altar. 19 This suggests that the Vedic image of the two death \ndogs passed into Norse mythology as a pair of canine gods, like the \nmany holy dogs, wolves, or jackals of the ancient world in general. \n\nOne of the oldest of these gods was Egyptian Anubis, brought \nfrom central Asia at a very early date under the name of Up-Uat, \n"Opener of the Way." He was also known as Mates, "He of the \nMother," similar to the archaic Irish word for a dog, madra. 20 This \nold Asian god was said to be a wolf, but he soon merged with the jackal \nAnubis, who was called his twin. The composite was a deity "whose \nface is like unto that of a greyhound . . . who feedeth on the dead . . . \nwho devoureth the bodies of the dead, and swalloweth hearts." In the \n\n\n\nDog \n\n\n\nProse Edda \n\nIcelandic saga, a \ncollection of traditional \nstories compiled by \nSnorri Sturluson in the \n13 th century a.d. \n\n\n\n241 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD8 predynastic period he governed sacrificial priests, "jackal-headed men \n\nwith slaughtering-knives," in an old section of the underworld. 21 \nmhmm^^^^^m Coptic Christians later identified Anubis with Cabriel, who was called a \njudge of the dead. 22 \n\nAs a lord of the land of death, Anubis became the god of \nmummification. He was often shown bending solicitously over the \nmummy of Osiris, applying the preservative mumiya from which the \nword "mummy" descended. When the Osiris cult became astrologi- \ncal, much of its imagery was transposed from the underworld to the \nheavens, including the image of Anubis. \n\nThe star of Anubis was Sothis (Sirius), the Eye of the Dog, in \nGreek, Canopis. Sirius is the star forming the "eye" of Canis Major, the \nGreat Dog. It is the brightest star in the sky. Egyptians believed it \nheld the soul of Osiris, whose rebirth coincided with the rising of the \nNile flood, when his star rose in the east. "Three wise men" pointed \nthe way to the newborn Savior: the three stars in Orion\'s belt, which \nform a line pointing to Sirius. The holy city of Anubis on earth was \nalso Canopis, the Eye of the Dog, origin of the canopic mummy-jar. \n\nAnubis came to Rome as a leading character in the Osirian \nMysteries. He was seen in processions "condescending to walk on \nhuman feet . . . rearing terrifically high his dog\'s head and neck that \nmessenger between heaven and hell displaying alternately a face \nblack as night, and golden as the day; in his left the caduceus, in his right \nwaving aloft the green palm branch. His steps were closely followed \nby a cow, raised into an upright posture the cow being the fruitful \nemblem of the Universal Parent, the goddess herself, which one of \nthe happy train carried with majestic steps, supported on his shoulders. \nBy another was borne the coffin containing the sacred things, and \nclosely concealing the deep secrets of the holy religion." 23 \n\nNot only Anubis, but many other dog-deities were worshipped \nthroughout the Roman empire. An early Roman cista from Pales- \ntrina-Praeneste showed the Moon-virgin Minerva sacrificing a naked \nMars over a cauldron, attended by her three-headed death dog, \nclearly the same as Persephone\'s or Hecate\'s Cerberus. 24 The dog as \nthe keeper of Mother\'s gate was known everywhere in antiquity, \nprobably because wild dogs were first domesticated as guardians of the \nhome threshold, doorways being generally sacred to women who \nowned the houses. In Assyria, images of dogs were buried under \nthresholds of houses, suggesting similar burials of deceased watchdogs \nin former times. 25 The dogs\' spirits continued to halt intruders, which \nmay account for the ancient custom of lifting a new bride over a \nthreshold, so the guardian spirits beneath would not think her an \nintruder but would accept her as a resident. \n\nThe Cynic sage Diogenes made himself a watchdog at the gate of \nthe Great Mother\'s temple, where he lived in "a large earthen pot," \nrepresenting the terrestrial womb. 26 Cynics were the Goddess\'s "doglike \nones" (kynikos). Their sect, founded in the 4th century B.C., professed \n\n\n\n242 \n\n\n\nto foretell the end of the world from the circumpolar constellation Ursa Dog \n\nMinor, which they called the Dog. The north pole star was the Dog\'s \n\nTail, kunos oura, the Cynosure. 27 When it moved from its place at the \n\nstill point of the turning world, according to the Cynics, the end of \nthe present universe was at hand. \n\nThe Cynic idea of the dog affixed to the north pole is still found in \nEuropean folklore. Slavs spoke of the three Zorya (triple Fate- \ngoddess), keeping "a dog which is tied by an iron chain to the \nconstellation of the Little Bear. When the chain breaks it will be the \nend of the world." 28 Egyptians similarly believed the Goddess kept \n"powers of darkness" fettered by a heavenly chain until the last days \nof the world. 29 Northern peoples said the chain held the cosmic \ndoomsday-wolf Fenrir, who would be released by the Norns (triple \nFate-goddess) to devour the heavenly father at the end of the world; this \nwould signal the destruction of all the gods. 30 Norsemen therefore \ncalled doomsday the Day of the Wolf. 31 \n\nThe Great Goddess was herself a wolf, in the very old Roman cult \nof the She- Wolf Lupa, whose original consort was Lupus, the Wolf. \nHe was also Feronius, or Dis Pater, a subterranean wolf god inherited \nfrom the Etruscans, as was the She- Wolf who suckled Rome\'s \nfounders, Romulus and Remus. The famous Lupercalian statue of the \nShe- Wolf was cast in bronze during the 5th century B.C. The two \nbabies under her belly were not part of the original work but were added \ncenturies later, to suit the Roman version of the legend. 32 \n\nThe Lupercalia may have been a corruption of Lupa-Kali; the \nOriental Great Goddess was also a she-wolf. Under her yoni-name of \nCunti she gave birth to a divine son "in the cave of the wolf," like the \nLupercal grotto. Her child was placed in a basket of rushes and set \nafloat on the Ganges, as Romulus and Remus were set afloat on the \nTiber, Moses was set afloat on the Nile, and Sargon was set afloat on \nthe Euphrates. The wolf bitch Lupa was identified with the midwife- \ngoddess Acca Larentia who took Romulus and Remus from their \nbasket, just as Akka took Sargon, and "pharaoh\'s daughter" (another \nversion of Akka) took Moses. Akka, Acca, or Acco was the same as \nHecate, who turned into a wolf bitch in Homeric legend. 33 Lupa (or \nAcca) disappeared into the sacred spring of the Lupercal grotto, \nwhere her spirit was worshipped every year at the Lupercalian festival. \n\nThere were many lupine foster-mothers in Middle-Eastern myths. \nTu Kueh, legendary founder of the Turkish nation, was preserved in \ninfancy by a holy she-wolf whom he subsequently married: that is, she \nwas the Goddess of the land in totemic form. 34 A famous Turkish \nleader was Ataturk, "the Gray Wolf." 35 Zoroaster was raised by a she- \nwolf. Cyrus the Great, born of Mandane (Moon-mother), was \nnursed by a woman whose Greek name was Cyno, her Median name \nSpako, meaning "Bitch." Siegfried too was a wolf\'s foster child; his \noldest name was Wolfdietrich. 36 \n\nThe oldest religion of the Canary Islands was a dog- or wolf-cult, \n\n\n\n243 \n\n\n\nDog traces of which are still seen in many ancient canine statues. Canary \n\nbirds and canary wine took their name from the islands, which were \n\n^^ mmmmmm ^^^^ am really named for Canis, the dog. 37 \n\nThe same name once applied to the hereditary caste of Jewish \npriests, Kohen or Cohen, from Greek kuon, "dog." 58 Because dogs \nwere associated with the old matriarchy, the epithet "dog" became an \ninsult to Semitic patriarchs; Islam forbids both women and dogs to \napproach a shrine. 59 Yet Moslems still incongruously believe the gall of \na black dog can serve as a holy amulet to purge an entire household \nof evil influences. 40 \n\nEarly Christians made an effort to assimilate the Gallo-Roman \nwolf god under the name of St. Lupus or St. Loup, "Holy Wolf." 41 \nHe was made a legendary bishop of Troyes, credited with miraculously \nturning back the invading Huns from his province; but this story was \nfiction masquerading as history. 42 The church was not wholly comfort- \nable with any of the manifestations of Lupus, who was really a \nprototype of the werewolf. Saxons used to worship him in the first \nmonth of the sacred year, called Wolf-monath (Wolf Month); but \nChristian authorities changed the name of this month to After- Yule, or \nJesu-monath. Its runic sign was a dot in a circle, the same as the \nFestival of the Circumcision of Christ (New Year\'s Day). 43 \n\nDiana the Huntress and her "dogs" had an extensive cult in \nEngland. Some of her legends merged with those of Arthur, Lance- \nlot, and other British heroes. One of the tales told how Lancelot, like \nActaeon, trespassed in the Goddess\'s greenwood and fell asleep at her \nsecret spring: \n\nThere was a Lady dwelt in that forest, and she was a great huntress, and \ndaily she used to hunt, and ever she bare her bow with her; and no man \nwent never with her, but always women, and they were shooters, and \ncould well kill a deer, both at the stalk and at the trest; and they daily \nbare bows and arrows, horns and wood knives, and many good dogs they \nhad. 44 \n\nWhen the "Lady" caught Lancelot in the forbidden place, she \ndidn\'t set her dogs on him as her forerunners had done. She only shot \nhim in the buttock, "that he might not sit on no saddle." 45 Thus he \nwas disgraced, since a warrior was supposed to show wounds only in \nfront. \n\nBecause dogs were natural companions of the housewife as well as \nthe huntress, they were often cited as witches\' familiars. A black dog \nseemed even more suspect than a black cat. The dog was frequently \nbelieved to be the animal form of a demon lover, probably because \nwomen were inclined to fondle their dogs; many women were hanged \nin England on that count alone. One witch was officially condemned \nfor having "carnal copulation with the devil in the likeness of a man, but \nhe removed from her in the likeness of a black dog." 46 \n\nGypsies told a story based on such witch trials: there was a \nbeautiful maiden whose lover was her dog. Once each year he \n\n\n\n244 \n\n\n\ntransformed himself into a man and lay with her. In due time, she gave Dog \n\nbirth to a "little white puppy," then she jumped into the river and \n\ndrowned (a popular method of disposing of witches was to drown them ^^^^_^^^__ \n\nin the so-called swimming ordeal). The demon lover assumed his \n\nhuman shape, retrieved the maiden\'s corpse, and brought her back to \n\nlife by placing the puppy-child at her breast to suck. Afterward, as in \n\nall fairy tales, they married and lived happily ever after. 47 \n\nThe black dog was the witch\'s helper in gathering materials for \ncharms. According to an exceptionally durable superstition, the \nmiraculous mandrake root could not be pulled out of the ground except \nby a black dog. This curiously formed root, called "the phallus of the \nfield," or "the devil\'s genitals," was supposed to emit a scream if \nuprooted by the unwary; and all who heard the sound would go \ninsane, or die. 48 \n\nThe Irish remembered the dog\'s connection with death and \nmaintained that true curses could be cast with a dog\'s help. Among \nthe Celts, cainte, "dog," denoted a satiric bard with magic power to \nspeak curses that would come true. 49 \n\nDogs or wolves played their ancient role of psychopomps in a \nnumber of strange stories about cathedral-building, which might be \ntraced all the way back to the Etruscan Lupus or Dis Pater, the wolf- \nheaded Lord of Death who carried sacrificial victims away. In the very \nold rite of the mundus, trenches dug for temple foundations were \nfilled with sacrificial blood. It was believed the building would be \nunstable if this blood-magic were omitted; so it was done, from Hindu \nIndia to Latium and Britain. Lupus appeared in sacred art as a wolf- \nangel carrying the victim to a blessed after-life. On an Etruscan vase, \nthe death-god Charon is assimilated to Lupus and wears a wolfskin. 50 \n\nThis notion that sacred buildings needed to be founded in blood \nhas been evident in every tradition including the Judeo-Christian \none. The Bible says when Hiel founded the city of Jericho, "he laid the \nfoundation thereof in (the blood of) Abiram his firstborn and set up \nthe gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of \nthe Lord" (1 Kings 16:34). British legend said Vortigern\'s temple \nwalls kept falling down because the blood sacrifice for their foundation \nhad been forgotten. 51 Such pagan customs continued in the Middle \nAges. Many skeletons have been found buried in walls, pillars, and \ncornerstones of churches and abbeys, placed there as supportive \nsacrifices. 52 A deaf-mute was buried under the cornerstone of a monas- \ntery near Gottingen. 53 A parish church at Holsworthy, North Devon, \nwas found in 1845 to have a skeleton in its southwest wall. 54 Illegitimate \nchildren were frequently buried in building foundations. One St. \nBenezet, or Little Bennet, was walled up in the foundation of a bridge \nat Avignon in 1 184. Five centuries later his crypt was opened, and \nSt. Benezet proved his saintly status by remaining fresh and unde- \ncayed. 55 So his ecclesiastical press agents claimed, at any rate. "It was \nreally a common thing among Christians to sacrifice children, maids, or \n\n\n\n245 \n\n\n\nDog \n\n\n\nChansons de gestes \n\nOld French epic \npoetry of the 11th to \n1 3th centuries. \n\n\n\ngrown-up people by burying them alive under the foundations of \ncastles, etc., to insure their stability." 56 \n\nWhen St. Columba founded a monastery on the island of Iona, he \ncalled for a volunteer to be buried alive in its foundation. A monk \nnamed Oran, or Odran, earned a later canonization by offering \nhimself. 57 For some reason perhaps a promise of Christ-like resurrec- \ntion he was dug up again after three days. Still alive, he began to \npreach blasphemous doctrines: there was no God, no devil, no heaven \nor hell. St. Columba therefore had him killed and re-buried. 58 It was \nnot uncommon for monks infected with Gnostic, agnostic, or atheistic \nbeliefs to meet with such a fate. \n\nEurope\'s totemic dog or wolf clans seem to have become involved \nin these sacrificial customs, just as they were involved in the ancient \ncult of the mundus. For instance, Cologne Cathedral was said to have \nbeen designed by the devil, and its bells were cast under the devil\'s \ndirection at the foundry of a mysterious smith named Wolf. After \ncasting a certain discordant bell, supposed to be rung only in time of \ndisaster, Wolf was killed by a fall from the bell tower. The architect who \ncollaborated with the devil was also killed, crushed by a great stone \nthat already had his name engraved on it. 59 \n\nChansons de gestes told a somewhat different version. The build- \ners of Cologne Cathedral killed a hero named Renaud (Fox) and \nburied him in the foundation. A church was erected to Renaud\'s \nmemory in 81 1 a.d.; a chapel stood on the spot in Cologne where he \nwas slain. 60 Some said Renaud was the same as the trickster-hero- \ndemigod Reynard the Fox; others said he was a great warrior, one of \nCharlemagne\'s paladins. \n\nThe devil and the wolf were also linked with Charlemagne\'s tomb \nat Aix-la-Chapelle. The devil contributed money to build the cathe- \ndral. In return, he demanded the life of the first creature to enter its \ndoors. At the dedication ceremony, people thrust a wolf into the \ndoor. The devil took the wolfs life. Then it was safe for people to enter. \nLike Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle had a discordant bell for emergencies. \nThe founder of this bell was crushed to death by the clapper, so the bell \nwas baptized with his blood. \n\nSimilar stories were told of Strasbourg Cathedral, supposedly \ndesigned by a wise witch named Sabine, once a title of Lupa, the \nSabine She- Wolf. The dedication of the cathedral was marked by the \nsacrifice of twin brothers, like Romulus and Remus, one of whom \nkilled the other by pushing him under a cornerstone as it was dropped \ninto place. (Of the twins nursed by the Sabine She- Wolf, Romulus \nkilled Remus while digging a furrow for the foundation of Rome\'s \nwalls.) The bishop of Strasbourg ordered the cornerstone raised \nagain, and the second brother was crushed under it also, by his wish. He \nexplained, "My body will serve as a protection to the cathedral." 61 \n\nRemnants of these curious beliefs and customs survived to the \npresent time. In World War II, the Nazi SS caused human bodies to \n\n\n\n246 \n\n\n\nbe "encased in the concrete fortifications and bunkers, as though such Dolcinists \n\nbodies could give strength to inanimate matter." 62 To this day, Greek \n\npeasants insist on a blood sacrifice at the building of any bridge, to bathe ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe foundation in the lifeblood of a bird or animal to "strengthen" \n\nit." \n\nThe notion that a dog\'s blood is equivalent to the blood of a \nhuman being is still found among the Berbers, who believe that a \nmurderer is magically tainted by the blood of his victim for the rest of his \nlife. The killer of a dog is similarly tainted. 64 Nearly everywhere one \ncan still find the belief that dogs can see ghosts and other spirits, left over \nfrom the formerly universal association of canines with the world of \ndeath and the special preserve of the underground Goddess. 65 \n\n1.

Believing himself nevertheless a true spiritual \nson of St. Francis, he gathered disciples and preached against the \nworldly wealth of the church. He was caught and burned, but the \nCongregation continued under Fra Dolcino, who preached the oncom- \ning doomsday, the fall of the sinful church, and the triumph of the \npoor and simple over the theocracy. \n\nDolcinists admitted women to their ranks, and granted their \n"sisters in Christ" the same right to preach and lead prayers as the \nmen, one of the worst manifestations of their heresy. Dolcinists claimed \nto renounce sexual relations; so when Dolcino\'s particular "dearly \nbeloved sister in Christ" Margherita di Trank bore him a child, it was \nbrought about through the miraculous agency of the Holy Ghost, \nthey said. \n\nThe Inquisition harassed the Dolcinists until they took refuge in \nthe high mountains. Three crusades were preached against them. In \nthe winter of 1 307 they were finally reduced to starvation, trapped, and \n\n\n\n247 \n\n\n\nDoomsday \n\n\n\nslaughtered. Dolcino was captured alive, unfortunately for him. After \nwatching his Margherita burn, he was torn to pieces by red-hot pincers \non a cart rolling slowly along the roads for all to watch. \n\nDespite this edifying example, Dolcinism persisted for another \ncentury. Two Dolcinist Apostles were captured and burned in \nGermany in 1404. 1 \n\n1. Lea unabridged, 614-23. \n\n\n\nPuranas are ancient \nSanskrit scriptures in \nverse, treating of cos- \nmologies, sacred \nhistories, and the nature \nof the divine. \n\n\n\nDoomsday \n\nThe universal idea of the world\'s end was rooted in ancient Hindu \nbelief in the cyclic alternation of universes, brought about by Kali. \n\nEach successive creation was divided into four yugas or ages: \nSatya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali, the fourth and last marking the age \nwhen Mother turns Destroyer because the race of men become violent \nand sinful, failing to perceive deity in the feminine principle. "Due to \nthe limited intelligence and lust of men in the Kali Yuga, they will be \nunable to recognize women as manifestations of the Shakti." Only a \nfew may escape spiritual degeneration: those who are devoted "to the \nlotus of their mothers\' feet and to their own wives." l \n\nWhen Kali\'s doomsday arrived, the gods would slay each other. \nEarth would be overwhelmed by fire and flood. The Goddess would \nswallow up everything and un-make it, returning to her primordial state \nof formless Chaos, as she was before creation. All beings would enter \nher, because "She devours all existence." 2 After a time that could not \nbe counted because even Time was destroyed, Kali would give birth \nto a new universe. \n\nThe Matsya Purana said signs of approaching doomsday were to \nbe found in the breakdown of social structures, the increase in \nviolence and crime, and the decline of human intelligence: \n\nThere is no one, any more, in whom enlightening goodness (sattva) \nprevails; no real wise man, no saint, no one uttering truth and standing \nby his sacred word. The seemingly holy Brahmin is no better than a fool. \nOld people, destitute of the true wisdom of old age, try to behave like \nthe young, and the young lack the candor of youth. The social classes \nhave lost their distinguishing, dignifying virtues. . . . The will to rise to \nsupreme heights has failed; the bonds of sympathy and love have dis- \nsolved; narrow egotism rules. . . . When this calamity has befallen the \nonce harmoniously ordered City of Man, the substance of the world- \norganism had deteriorated beyond salvage, and the universe is ripe for \ndissolution. } \n\nThe Vishnu Purana said the world in its last days reaches a stage \nwhere "property confers rank, wealth becomes the only source of virtue, \npassion the sole bond of union between husband and wife, falsehood \n\n\n\n248 \n\n\n\nthe source of success in life, sex the only means of enjoyment, and Doomsday \n\nwhen outer trappings are confused with inner religion." 4 \n\nAsiatic arts of astronomic observation and calculation of calendars ^^- B ^^^ \nwere motivated by an earnest desire to know the exact length of each \nyuga, to foresee the end. An age was supposed to begin when sun, \nmoon, and planets stood in conjunction at the initial point of the \necliptic and to end when they returned to the same point. By Hindu \nreckoning, the present yuga began in 3 1 02 B.C. The chronology of \n\'the Central American Maya began in 3 1 1 3 B.C., only 1 1 years later, "a \ndiscrepancy probably due to some minor miscalculation in reckoning \nbackward from the observed movements of the heavenly bodies." 5 \n\nAncient Mesopotamia set the same dates as India and Mexico \nbetween 3113 and 3 1 02 b.c. for the beginning of civilized arts, \nespecially astronomical calculation. The Babylonian sage Berossus said \n"the world will burn when all the planets that now move in different \ncourses come together in the Crab, so that they all stand in a straight \nine in the same sign, and . . . the future flood will take place when \nthe same conjunction occurs in Capricorn. For the former is the \nconstellation of the summer solstice, the latter of the winter solstice; \nthey are the decisive signs of the zodiac, because the turning points of \nthe year lie in them." Jeremias commented: \n\nThis Babylonian doctrine has spread over the whole world. We find it \nagain in Egypt, in the religion of the Avesta, and in India; traces of it \nare discovered in China, as well as in Mexico and among the savage \nnations of South America. To refer these phenomena back to "elemen- \ntary ideas" such as may arise independently among different peoples, will \nnot hold good in view of the circumstance that we have to do with ideas \nconnected with definite facts which rest upon continued astronomical \nobservations. 6 \n\nThese remarks shed light on the great Neolithic monuments \npiown to be astronomical calculators, suggesting a good reason why \nhey were built with so much care and effort. The Stoic philosophers \n)f doomsday drew upon a very ancient tradition in predicting the \nvorld\'s end in terms almost identical with those of Oriental sages: "A \nlew sea will overrun everything, and the Ocean, today the boundary \n.nd girdle of the world, will occupy its centre. . . . What nature has \nnade into separate parts will be confounded into a single mass." This \nreed of dissolution into Chaos became "an important part of \nitoicism." 7 \n\nNorthern Europeans drew their myths of doomsday or Ragnarok \nrom the same ancient tradition. They said the world\'s end would be \nrought about by the Mutspell (Mother\'s Curse) when violent gods \neglected the old laws of peace and blood kinship. The angry \nJoddess would become Skadi the Destroyer, a great shadow devouring \nle world, like her Oriental counterpart Kali. The gods would enter \n\n\n\n249 \n\n\n\nDoomsday that shadow of Gotterdammerung, literally the Going-Into-the-Shadow- \n\nof-the-Gods. They would be consumed, and the heavens and earth \n^^^^^aa^ with them. The world would sink back into the womb of primal chaos \nwhich gave it birth in the beginning. 8 \n\nThis was the prophecy of the sybilline priestess who wrote the \nVoluspa. It was echoed by the Irish sybil Babd, one of the three Fate- \ngoddesses. She foretold the coming of the Waste Land, "trees without \nfruit and seas without fish; old men would give false judgments and \nlegislators make unjust laws; warriors would betray one another, and \nmen would be thieves, and there would be no more virtue left in the \nworld." 9 \n\nAfter destruction of this nonvirtuous world and its cruel gods, there \nwould be a period of dark nonexistence. Then the Goddess\'s womb \nwould bring forth a new universe. A new human race would arise from \na primal couple, a woman named Life one of the Semitic names of \nEve and a man named Desirer-of-Life. 10 \n\nPatriarchal Persians made some alterations in the picture. Their \nidea of doomsday was as dire as any, with the usual convulsions of the \nearth, fires, flood, and fallings of heaven; but they denied the subse- \nquent creation of a new world. Their concept was not cyclic, but \nlinear. Creation and doomsday could occur only once. After the great \nbattle Armageddon at the end of the world, "The War of the Sons of \nLight with the Sons of Darkness," the heavenly forces of the sun god \nwould prevail. 11 They would divide the sinful from the virtuous and \nassign them to heaven or hell. The aftermath was not another creation, j \nbut eternal stasis, like the Brahman Nirvana. \n\nPassing through Jewish-Essenic and Roman-Mithraic sects into \nChristianity, this Persian doomsday became the familiar one in the west \nwith numerous details borrowed from the older Aryan paganism. The \nlast Trump played on Gabriel\'s horn was originally played on Rig- \nHeimdall\'s "ringing horn" (Gjallarhorn). 12 The Great Serpent slain \nby Thor in the final battle became identified with Satan. 13 Like \npaganism\'s sacred dramas, the final drama of the earth\'s dissolution \nwas divided into five acts. 14 Christians even translated the Norse \n"Mother\'s Curse" as "Judgment Day" when they found it variously \nrendered Mutspell, Muspell, Muspelle, Mudspeller, or Muspilli. 15 \n\nThe Savior destined to appear before the world\'s end had an old I \nform in Buddhist scriptures as Kalki Avatara, the Destroyer of Sin, \nwho would come from heaven to announce doomsday. 16 Persians \ncopied him, changing his title to Son of Man, or Messiah. Before 1 70 \nB.C., the Book of Enoch called him Christos, the Anointed One, and \nannounced that he had already come and gone, and that his Second \nComing was expected at any moment. 17 \n\nAccording to the Gospels, Jesus identified himself with this person \nage who would be seen "coming in the clouds with great power and \n\n\n\n250 \n\n\n\nglory. And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his Doomsday \n\nelect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the \n\nuttermost part of heaven" (Mark 13:26-27). Jesus was not the only ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nMessiah of his time. Josephus said before 70 a.d. there were countless \n\nMessiahs and Christs announcing the end of the world. 18 \n\nThe Gospels promised doomsday almost at once. Jesus said it \nwould occur in his own generation: "There be some standing here, \nwhich shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God" (Luke \n9:27). Early Christians accordingly expected the world\'s end so soon \nthat there was no reason to marry and beget children who would never \ngrow up, a major reason for Christianity\'s renunciation of marriage. \nMotherhood would only harm women in the convulsions of the last \ndays: "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give \nsuck, in those days!" (Luke 21:23). \n\nHopeful Christians found that Jesus\'s generation and many other \ngenerations passed without apocalyptic symptoms. Seeking an expla- \nnation, theologians discovered the text saying a thousand years were but \na day in the sight of God (Psalms 90:4), another borrowing from \nOriental sages who said a Day of Brahma lasted a thousand years. On \nthe basis of this scripture it was decided that the world would end in \nthe year 1000 a.d. With the approach of that year, Europe was seized \nby an apocalyptic mania. Farms and towns were abandoned as \nfanatics tramped the countryside announcing the Last Days. In some \nareas, agriculture and commerce came virtually to a standstill. The \nyear passed uneventfully enough, but human society suffered greatly \nfrom famines and civil disorders caused by the doomsday belief. 19 \n\nSome Franciscans declared that Christ really had returned to earth \nin 1000 a.d., disguised as St. Francis, the new Messiah, who was \n"entirely transformed into the person of Christ." Francis was said to \nhave performed all the Christ-like miracles, cast out devils, turned \nwater into wine, cured the sick, raised the dead, made the blind see, and \nso on. 20 There were those who went so far as to claim that Christ was \nimportant only as a precursor of St. Francis. 21 \n\nNot only the Christ figure was supposed to return just before \ndoomsday, but also Antichrist, his adversary, for the final battle \nbetween good and evil couldn\'t take place until all the forces were \nassembled on either side. According to a German legend, Antichrist \ncould not come to earth as long as the Holy Roman (German) Empire \nstood. 22 This legend served to keep some of the warring nationlets in \nline at times, but the Holy Roman Empire was a rather loose, indefin- \nable entity for most of its existence. Antichrist was almost as \nconstantly anticipated as Christ. \n\nAnother who taught that the Last Judgment had already taken \nplace was Swedenborg; he gave its date as 1757, the date of the \nestablishment of his own Church of the New Jerusalem. He wisely \n\n\n\n251 \n\n\n\nDoppelganger refrained from predicting the world\'s end a short time in advance, but \n\nDove others fell into this trap, dimming, in England, predicted the end of the \n\n^ wm world in 1867, with resulting injury to his credibility when the end \nfailed to come. \n\nA prominent doomsday prophet was William Miller, inadvertent \nfounder of the sects of Jehovah\'s Witnesses and Seventh-Day Ad- \nventists. He fixed the date of the millenium on March 21, 1843. His \nfollowers were afire with enthusiasm, but still failed to see Christ \ndescending from the clouds as expected. Miller decided he had miscal- \nculated, and fixed a new date on October 21 of the same year. "On \nthe appointed day of doom frenzied believers donned their robes, \ntucked an ultimate lunch in the folds, and took their places on the \nhousetops, facing east. On the 22nd they ate their lunch and climbed \ndown. Miller confessed his disappointment, but insisted \'the day of \nthe Lord is at the door.\' " 23 The Millerites never gave up hope. Their \noffshoot sects still exist and flourish, though naive displays of credulity \nare usually avoided. \n\n1. Mahanirvanatantra, 12, 53, 56, 177. 2. Mahanirvanatantra, 295-96. \n\n3.

Sometimes the afterbirth was said to be an un- \nformed twin of the newborn baby; by magic it might assume the \nliving twin\'s shape and follow him through life. Sometimes this was \nthought to be the Doppelganger seen in one\'s reflection. \n\n\n\nDove \n\nAphrodite\'s totem, the bird of sexual passion, symbolically equivalent \nto the yoni. 1 In India, too, the dove was paravata, the symbol of lust. 2 \nJoined to her consort the phallic serpent, the Dove-goddess stood for \nsexual union and "Life." \n\nThe phrase attributed to Jesus, "Be ye therefore wise as serpents, \nand harmless as doves" (Matthew 10:16), was no random metaphor \nbut a traditional invocation of the Syrian God and Goddess. 3 The \nOriental meaning was remembered by the gypsies, whose folk tales \nsaid the souls of ancestors lived inside magic hollow mountains, the men \nhaving been changed into serpents and the women into doves. 4 \n\n\n\n252 \n\n\n\nChristians adopted the feminine dove as a symbol of the Holy Dove \n\nGhost, originally the Goddess Sophia, representing God\'s "Wisdom" \n\nas the Goddess Metis represented the "Wisdom" of Zeus. Gnostic ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nChristians said Sophia was incarnate in the dove that impregnated the \nvirgin Mary, the same dove that descended on Jesus at his baptism to \nimpregnate his mind (Matthew 3:16). Pious admirers of Pope Greg- \nory the Great made him even more saintly than Jesus by reporting that \nthe Holy Ghost in dove shape descended on him not once but many \ntimes. 5 All this was copied from Roman iconography which showed the \nhuman soul as a dove that descended from the Dove-goddess\'s \noversoul to animate the body. 6 \n\nAphrodite as a bringer of death, or "peace," sometimes bore the \nname of Irene, Dove of Peace. Another of her death-goddess names \nwas Epitymbria, "She of the Tombs." 7 Romans called her Venus \nColumba, Venus-the-Dove. Her catacombs, mausoleums, and ne- \ncropoli were known as columbaria, "dovecotes." 8 Thus the soul \nreturning to the Goddess after death was again envisioned as a dove. \nFrom this image, Christians copied their belief that the souls of saints \nbecame white doves that flew out of their mouths at the moment of \ndeath. In the Catholic ceremony of canonization, white doves are \nreleased from cages at the crucial moment of the ritual. 9 \n\nChristian iconography showed seven rays emanating from the \ndove of the Holy Ghost: an image that went back to some of the most \nprimitive manifestations of the Goddess. 10 In the Orient, the mystic \nseven were the Pleiades or "Seven Sisters," whose Greek name \nmeant "a flock of doves." They were daughters or "rays" of Aphrodite \nunder her title of Pleione, Queen of the Sea. 11 Herodotus said seven \nholy women known as Doves founded the oracles of Dodona, Epirus, \nand Theban Amon. 12 They were worshipped in the Middle East as \nSeven Sages or Seven Pillars of Wisdom: the seven woman-shaped \npillars that had been upholding temples of the Goddess since the \nthird millenium B.C. 13 See Caryatid. Arabs still revere the Seven Sages, \nand some remember that they were women, or "doves." H The \nSemitic word for "dove," ione, was a cognate of "yoni" and related to \nthe Goddess Uni, who later became Iune, or Juno. \n\nThe cult of the Doves used to incorporate primitive rites of \ncastration and its modification, circumcision. India called the seven \nSisters "razors" or "cutters" who judged and "critically" wounded men, \nthe Krittikas, "Seven Mothers of the World," root of the Greek \nkritikos, "judge." They killed and gave rebirth to gods who were \ncastrated to make them fertile, like women. The name of Queen \nSemiramis, legendary founder of Babylon, also meant "Dove" in the \nSyrian tongue. She was said to have castrated all her consorts. 15 \n\nWhen circumcision replaced castration, the doves were involved in \nthat too. Even Christian symbolism made the connection. The \n\n\n\n253 \n\n\n\nDrama official symbol of the Festival of the Circumcision of Christ was a dove, \n\nholding in its beak a ring representing the Holy Prepuce. "Christ\'s \n\n^ HMMHHH i^^^^ M fructifying blood" was linked with the similar emblem of Pentecost, \n\nwhich showed the descending dove on a background of blood red, \n\nofficially described as a representation of the church fertilized by the \n\nblood of Christ and the martyrs. 16 \n\nA certain "maiden martyr" called St. Columba (Holy Dove) was \n\nwidely revered, especially in France, although she never existed as a \n\nhuman being. 17 Another curious survival of pagan dove-lore was the \n\nsurname given to St. Peter: Bar-Iona, "Son of the Dove." 18 Some \n\nsurvivals may have been invented to explain the doves appearing on \n\nancient coins as symbols of Aphrodite and Astarte. 19 \n\n1.

The \naudience participated with songs, dances, sexual orgies, laments, eating \nthe god and rejoicing at his restoration. One object was attainment of \nreligious ecstasy: entering into the "dream." \n\nIt has been shown that every dream bears "a remarkable resem- \nblance to drama." 1 Old Norse draumar, related to German Traum \n(dream), featured a sacrificial slaying of the god, the "tragic" part of the \nperformance. 2 \n\nTragedy descended from the "goat-song" enacting the sacred \ndramas of Dionysus or Pan. The five-act structure of classical tragic \ndrama still seen in the plays of Shakespeare was established by the \nfive-act rites of the god. The acts were: (1) agon, the Contest: the \nincumbent incarnation of the god fought his challenger; (2) pathos, the \nPassion: the god united with the goddess and sent forth his soul with \nhis semen (or blood) to fertilize the world anew he died in his own \nbegetting; (3) threnos, the Lament: a "threnody" of wailings and \ngestures of grief, partly to absolve the audience of responsibility for the \ngod\'s death; (4) anagnorisis, the Discovery: priestesses returned to the \ntomb to find that the god was "risen," in much the same ritual enacted \nby Mary Magdalene and other temple-women at the tomb of Jesus \n(Luke 24:10) where, significantly, no men were present; (5) apotheosis, \nthe Deification: the resurrected victim became God, and rose to \nheaven, to be a part of his divine father. 3 On this occasion the \n\n\n\n254 \n\n\n\nworshippers threw themselves into an orgy of rejoicing, such as Droit du Seigneur \ndistinguished the Roman carnival called Hilaria, "Day of Joy," follow- \ning the death and resurrection of the savior Attis. 4 \n\nDionysus, Pan, Attis, Osiris, Orpheus, and many other gods of the \nmystery-cults contributed their dramas to medieval mystery plays, \ntheir linear descendants. The mummers\' play, the ceremonies of \nCarnival, May Day, Harvest Home and other festivals used parts of \nthe old sacred drama. Characters of the classic commedia were modeled \non some of the pagan deities. The Dove-goddess became Columbine \n(Dove). The Serpent-god became Pierrot (Big Peter, or the Pied One). \nThe name of Harlequin came from the Hellequins, or Hella cunni, \n"kindred of the Goddess Hel," souls of the pagan dead riding forth from \nher underworld. 5 \n\nMasks were customary in the early medieval drama, just as they \nwere in the plays of ancient Greece and Rome. From a magical point \nof view, the essence of the character lay in the mask, not in the actor \nwho wore it. This was the primitive theory behind all appearances of \nmask and costume in religious ceremonies, from the animal-headed \n"gods" of Egypt human bodies wearing the deities\' disguises to \nmodern priestly vestments. Savages still say that, by putting on the mask \nand costume of an animal, spirit, or deity (or all at once), they do not \nsimply make believe but actually become that creature. 6 See Mask. \n\nl.Sagan, 178. 2.

An outgrowth of the feudal system that equated ownership of \nand with ownership of women. The droit du seigneur meant that \nivery serf\'s bride must be deflowered on her wedding night not by her \n>ridegroom but by the lord of the land. \n\nAs laid down by Ewen III of Scotland in the 9th century, the law \naid wives of common folk could be raped by any nobleman at any \nime; and "the lord of the ground shall have the maidenhead of all \nirgins dwelling on the same." \' \n\nThe church upheld the droit du seigneur as a God-given right of \nle nobility. For a vassal bridegroom to consummate his marriage \n/ithin three nights after the wedding was declared blasphemous "to the \n\nbenediction" and tantamount to "carnal lust." 2 The overlord\'s \n\nhowever, was right and proper. The eastern church provided legal \n\nlties for a man who tried to consummate his marriage before his \n\ner could rape the bride.* \n\nDroit du seigneur was a general rule throughout the feudal period \n\ncontinued in Russia up to the 19th century. 4 \n\n\n\n255 \n\n\n\nDruids \n\n\n\nThe system also continued in America\'s slaveholding south before \nthe civil war, unofficially but generally acknowledged. Every black \nwoman was the sexual property of her master, whether she was married \nto another slave or not. 5 Slave marriages could be legally ignored if \nplantation owners cared to do so. In 1757, Peter Fontaine said planta- \ntion owners begot so many children on their female slaves that "the \ncountry swarms with mulatto bastards." Thomas Anburey praised the \nsystem, calling it "a pleasant method to procure slaves at a cheap \nrate." 6 \n\nl.Bullough ( 168. 2.Brasch,74. 3. Briffault 3, 242. 4. Fielding, 155. \n5.

Greek \nmyth said the dryads were oak nymphs, each an oracular priestess with \nher own personal tree spirit, like the biblical Deborah who lived \nunder a tree that bore her own name (Judges 4:5). Dryads were called \npriestesses of Artemis, whose souls dwelt in their trees. They could \nalso assume the shapes of serpents, and were then called Hamadryads, \nor Amadryades. 2 In their druidic groves throughout northern Europe, \nStrabo said, they practiced rites "similar to the orgies of Samothrace."* \n\nDryadism and druidism were two phases of the same religion, \nevidently restricted to a female priesthood in the earlier, matriarchal \nstage, later open to male priests as well. Gaulish and British priests of th< \noak groves formed a class of bardic wizards, keeping a sacred tradition \nby memorizing orally transmitted material, the nucleus of medieval \nsagas, epics, and ballads. \n\nThere is no break between the ancient semi-magical formulae chanted b 4 \nthe Druids and the later incantation of the wizard and the "wise- \nwoman. " They both arose in the Veda-like sacred hymns which formed \nthe depository of the learning professed by the body of the druidical \nteachers and diviners and taught orally in the druidic schools. Most of \nthem were never written down, and the fragments that we possess in \nwriting are probably only the remains of a considerable body of oral \nliterature. 4 \n\nDruids were attacked by the Christian church for their pagan- \nism, but especially for their propensity to include sacred women in their \nranks. Scot said even in his day there were feminine spirits associated \nwith trees, called Dryads in Greece and Druids in Scotland. They were \nshape-shifters, and could appear as either birds or women. "They \nknow our thoughts, and can prophesy of things to come." 5 \n\nDespite nominal conversion to Christianity, the Irish clung to \ndruidism for many centuries. Their revered pagan king Diarmuid was i \n\n\n\n256 \n\n\n\ncalled "half a druid and half a Christian." To make St. Patrick\'s legend Durga \n\nmore palatable to the Irish, monks claimed he had been educated by a \n\ndruid. 6 Irish churches were known by the old druidic name of dairthech, ^^^^^^^^^^ \n"oak-house," formerly applied to the sacred grove. 7 \n\nThe "colleges" of druidesses, or dryads, passed by almost imper- \nceptible degrees into a new designation of Christian nuns. One of the \nthree classes of druidesses consisted of secluded sisterhoods, like the \npriestesses of Brigit, living in convent-like sanctuaries and tending \nsacred fires that were kept perpetually burning. Another, less secluded \nclass of druidesses consisted of married women who lived at the \ntemple and went home occasionally to visit their husbands. A third class \nwas composed of temple servants who lived with their families. 8 With \nthe coming of Christianity, the high holy sisterhoods were assimilated as \nnuns. The others were usually described as witches. \n\nThe druidic religion lasted a surprisingly long time over a surpris- \ningly wide geographical area. Christians continued to worship oak \ndeities in their sacred groves through the 8th century a.d. in Hesse. \nAccording to Gildas, Christian monks copied their tonsure from the \ndruids. Traces of druidism were found as late as 1874 in Russia. 9 Even \nclearer traces were found in the 20th century in the Holy Land, \nwhere the Goddess of the sacred groves was worshipped as Asherah \nsince pre-biblical times, and was known in Canaan as progenitress of \nthe gods. 10 Her priestesses the oak-nymphs continued to be venerated \nunder the title of Benat Ya\'kob (Daughters of Jacob), said to dwell in \ntheir trees near old shrines that were rededicated to mythical Moslem \nsaints. The trees were taboo. Their wood was never taken for fuel, \nexcept for votive purposes. 11 \n\nTo some extent the mystical reverence for oak trees persists to this \nday. Many British and American towns have their venerable "Char- \nter Oak" or some superannuated tree where seasonal ceremonies take \nplace. Acorns and oak leaves are still considered appropriate for \nwreaths and harvest decorations, even if they no longer crown the \n| Goddess\'s sacred kings. \n\n1. Piggott, 105-6. 2. Lawson, 153. 3.

Durga was entitled "The Inaccessible." A crowned \nKmazon, she rode tigers into battle and defeated many demonic \nmonsters, defending her children the gods. 1 Like other forms of the \npoddess-as-warrior, such as the Middle-Eastern Ma-Bellona, Durga \n\n\n\n257 \n\n\n\nDusii drank the blood of her enemies. 2 What this really meant was that her \n\nDymphna, Saint altars or images were anointed with the blood of war captives, killed as \n\n^^g^^^B^ trophies. \n\nAs "The Inaccessible," Durga personified the fighting spirit of a \nmother protecting her young, and perhaps also the nursing mother \nsexually "inaccessible" to men, according to the old Oriental custom. \nDurga stood for the basic animal instincts of maternity, for which the \nadult male is no longer significant, and only her offspring claims a \nmother\'s attention. \n\nDurga was sometimes Shasthi, "the Sixth," Leader of the Moth- \ners. This title arose from the custom of invoking her on the sixth day \nafter childbirth, when the continuous spells for protection of mother and \nchild could be brought to an end. The seventh day was a day of rest. 3 \nThis was the true beginning of the common patriarchal legend of gods \nwho gave birth to the world in six days and rested on the seventh. \nAmong such gods were Persia\'s Ahura Mazda, Memphian Ptah, Babylo- \nnian Marduk, Syrian Baal, and the Hebraic Jehovah. 4 \n\nDurga\'s titles and character penetrated western ideas of the God- \ndess before the first century B.C. Rome\'s Great Mother Juno had the \nsame attributes as her Oriental sister; she was Juno the Preserver, \nQueen of the Mothers. 5 \n\nl.L*rousse,333. 2. O\'Flaherty, 249. 3.

Dympna Dymphna, Saint \n\nA canonization of what seems to have been a bit of graffiti on a brick \nfound near Antwerp in the 1 3th century. The brick was buried near a \ncoffin containing the bones of an unidentified man and woman. The \nwords on the brick were ma dompna, "my lady," the traditional address \nof a medieval poet to his lady-love. \n\nThough having no more basis than these words on an old brick, \n\n\n\n258 \n\n\n\nJk \n\n\n\nthe cult of St. Dymphna was carefully developed. A large asylum \nnear Gheel was named after her, so she became the patron saint of the \ninsane perhaps appropriately. To this day she is still touted as the \nintercessor for people with emotional problems. 1 \n\nl.Attwater, 108. \n\n\n\nDymphna, Saint \n\n\n\n259 \n\n\n\nThe Creation of eve, in \nthe version that says \nshe was made from one \nof Adam\'s ribs. \nFlorentine School. \nWood panel; Fra \nBartolommeo, ca. 1510. \n\neuropa and the Bull, here \nshown on a red-figure \nvase, approximately 1 1 \nby 1 1 inches. Greek, \nca. 490 b.c. \n\n\n\n\nEag\'e Eagle \n\nClassic soul-bird, symbol of apotheosis associated with the sun god, \n^^^^^^^^ fire, and lightning. Greeks thought eagles so closely akin to the lightning \nspirit that they nailed eagles to the peaks of temples to serve as magic \nlightning rods. Hence the name aetoi, "eagles," for the pediments of \nGreek temples. 1 These were ancient forerunners of the "weather- \ncock" on the rooftree of a barn or house. \n\nCults of fire and the sun made the eagle a bearer of kingly spirit: \nthe god\'s soul returning to heaven after a period of earthly incarna- \ntion as the king. 2 It was the Roman custom to release an eagle above the \nfuneral pyre of each emperor, just as an Egyptian pharoah rose to \nheaven on the wings of the solar hawk. 3 \n\nZeus himself took the shape of an eagle to carry his young lover \nGanymede to heaven. This was often interpreted as a symbol of the \nfather-god\'s reception of men\'s souls when they were initiated into the \nsolar Mysteries. 4 \n\nThe eagle was connected with rites of calling down "fire from \nheaven," probably with a burning-glass, to consume sacrifices on the \naltar. Such "fire from heaven" came down from Yahweh to consume \nthe sons of Aaron (Leviticus 10:2), who died like sacrificial victims to \nthe solar gods of Tyre. Such victims "passed through the fire" as \nofferings, and rose to heaven in the form of eagles. \n\nWe must bear in mind that in the East, whence all these beliefs and cults \nderive, not only was fire regarded as an all-powerful purifying agent, \nbut death by fire was looked upon as an apotheosis which raised the victim \nto the rank of the gods. . . . "Fire, "says Iamblichus, "destroys the \nmaterial part of sacrifices, it purifies all things that are brought near it, \nreleasing them from the bonds of matter and, in virtue of the purity of \nits nature, making them meet for communion with the gods. So, too, it \nreleases us from bondage of corruption, it likens us to the gods. 5 \n\nThe eagle was often identified with the fire bird or phoenix, \nwho underwent a baptism of the fire that "burns all sins" and was \nreborn from his own ashes. The eagle also stood for the soul of \nHeracles, who passed through fire into heaven at seasonal festivals of \nTarsus, and inspired St. Paul\'s belief in the virtue of giving one\'s \nbody to be burned (1 Corinthians 13:3). The eagle was the totemic \nform of Prometheus, who "stole" fire from heaven, like the eastern \nfire-lightning-sun hero, man, or angel embodied in the Garuda bird. \nGaruda flew to the mountain of paradise to steal the gods\' secret of \nimmortality. Later, he assumed the golden body of the sun. American \nIndians had a similar hero, the thunderbird or lightning bird. 6 \n\nAs the royal bird of Rome, and the embodiment of deified \nemperors, the eagle was worshipped by Roman legionaries. Each \nlegion had its sacred eagles, carried into battle like banners. If a legion \nshould lose its eagles, the disgrace was unbearable; another whole \nexpedition might be mounted to recover them. 7 \n\n\n\n262 \n\n\n\nThe Roman imperial emblem was inherited by the Germanic E-Anna \n\n"Holy Roman Empire" and its Kaisers, derived from Caesars. Thus Earth \n\nthe eagle became a Teutonic symbol of sovereignty. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nl.Reinach,90. 2. Strong, 182. 3. Campbell, Oc.M., 334. 4. Strong 187 \n5. Strong, 194. 6. Hallet, 376. 7. Tacitus, 41. \n\n\n\nE-Anna \n\n"Land of Anna," one of the territories of Babylon, named after the \nGoddess under one of her most common Mesopotamian names (see \nAnne, Saint). \n\n\n\nEarth \n\nHerodotus said, "Three different names have been given to the \nearth, which is but one, and those derived from the names of women." \' \nHerodotus miscounted. Thousands of feminine names have been \ngiven to the earth. Continents Asia, Africa, Europe were named \nafter manifestations of the Goddess. Countries bore the names of \nfemale ancestors or of other manifestations of the Goddess: Libya, \nLydia, Russia, Anatolia, Latium, Holland, China, Ionia, Akkad, \nChaldea, Scotland (Scotia), Ireland (Eriu, Hera) were but a few. 2 Every \nnation gave its own territory the name of its own Mother Earth. \nTacitus said the tribes of Europe regarded Mother Earth as "the all- \nruling deity, to whom all else is subject and obedient." 3 \n\nMother Earth received universal worship because she was the \nuniversal parent. American Indians still relate how all peoples and \nanimals in the beginning emerged from Earth\'s yonic hole, and "it was \njust like a child being born from its mother. The place of emergence \nis the womb of the earth." Siberian reindeer hunters say the human race \nemerged from a Goddess, whose carved figurines protect the hunter\'s \nhut, when given offerings and prayers: "Help us to keep healthy! Help \nus to kill much game!" 4 \n\nThe central doctrine of Amerindian religion was reincarnation in a \nnew body from Mother Earth\'s womb, the ancient meaning of "born \nagain." A chief named Smohalla spoke of his moral obligations formed \nby this doctrine: \n\nIt is a sin to wound or cut, to tear or scratch our common mother by \nworking at agriculture. You ask me to dig in the earth? Am I to take a \nknife and plunge it into the breast of my mother? But then, when I die, \nshe will not gather me again into her bosom. You tell me to dig up and \ntake away the stones. Must I mutilate her flesh so as to get at her bones? \nThen I can never again enter into her body and be born again. 5 \n\nOriental Indians had much the same idea about entering the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n263 \n\n\n\nEarth earth. Hindu priests told a dead man: "Go, seek the earth, that wise and \n\nkind mother of all. O Earth, rise up and do not hurt his bones; be \n\n^^^^^^^^m kind and gentle to him. O Earth, cover him as a mother covers her \ninfant with the skirts of her garment." 6 \n\nAncient Roman philosophers had the same idea too. "The Earth \nMother is the mysterious power that awakes everything to life. ... All \ncomes from the earth and all ends in the earth ... the earth produces all \nthings and then enfolds them again . . . the Goddess is the beginning \nand end of all life." A Roman writer of the 3rd century a.d. prayed to \n"Holy Goddess Earth, Nature\'s mother, who bringeth all to life, and \nrevives all from day to day. The food of life Thou grantest in eternal \nfidelity. And when the soul hath retired we take refuge in Thee. All \nthat Thou grantest falls back somewhere into Thy womb." 7 \n\nPatriarchal Christians might have been expected to speak of Father \nHeaven rather than Mother Earth, yet even they found it impossible \nto give up the older deity. The epitaph of Pope Gregory the Great said: \nSuscipe Terra tuo de corpore sumptum: "Receive, O Earth, what \nwas taken from thy body." 8 Even up to the 20th century, tombstones of \nGerman Christians bore the formula: Hier ruht im Mutterschoss der \nErde . . . , "Here rests in Earth\'s maternal womb. . . ." 9 In Chaucer\'s \nPardoner\'s Tale an old man pleaded with the Goddess: \n\n. . . / walk alone and wait \nAbout the earth, which is my mother\'s gate, \nKnock-knocking with my staff from night to noon \nAnd crying, "Mother, open to me soon! \nLook at me, Mother, won \'tyou Jet me in? \nSee how I wither, flesh and bones and skin! \nAlas! When will these bones be laid to rest?" 10 \n\nThis was more than a poetic metaphor. As late as the 1 2th \ncentury, many Europeans still recognized Mother Earth as a Goddess, \nperhaps their only supreme divinity. She was described in an English \nherbal of the period with no mention of God at all: \n\nEarth, divine goddess, Mother Nature, who dost generate all things and \nbringest forth ever anew the sun which thou hast given to the nations; \nGuardian of sky and sea and of all Gods and powers; through thy \ninfluence all nature is hushed and sinks to sleep. . . . Again, when it \npleases thee, thou sendest forth the glad daylight and nurturest life with \nthine eternal surety; and when the spirit of man passes, to thee it \nreturns. Thou art indeed rightly named Great Mother of the Gods; \nVictory is thy divine name. Thou art the source of the strength of \npeoples and gods; without thee nothing can either be born or made \nperfect; thou art mighty, Queen of the Gods. Goddess, I adore thee as \ndivine, I invoke thy name; vouchsafe to grant that which I ask of thee, so \nshall I return thanks to thy godhead. " \n\nUp to the Renaissance, English farmers continued to call upon \nErce, eorthan modor (Earth, mother of earth) when planting. 12 Similar- \n\n\n\n264 \n\n\n\nly, up to the 20th century, Russian farmers continued to call upon Earth \n\nMati-Syra-Zemlya (Moist Mother Earth) for almost everything. Instead \n\nof touching a Bible when taking an oath, a Russian peasant would put ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\na clod of earth on his head, invoking the Mother\'s curse if he broke his \nword. 13 This perpetuated an ancient Greek habit. Even the patriar- \nchal Olympian gods swore their binding oaths by Mother Earth: Gaea, \nor Rhea, called Universal Mother, Deep-Breasted One, firmly \nfounded, oldest of divinities. 13 Hesiod admitted that she ruled Olympus \nbefore the coming of the Hellenic deities. She ruled Russia too. The \ncountry bore her ancient name, Rha (Rhea), the Red One, mother of \nthe Volga and all its tribes. 14 \n\nHome and Mother were literally identical to people who combined \nboth in their image of the earth-goddess. Many believed they must be \nburied in the same soil that supported them in childhood. Threatened \nby invaders, the matriarchal Cimmerians could have saved them- \nselves by moving away from their homeland; but they chose to face \nsuperior numbers of enemies, and die where they were, believing \ntheir lives valueless if they couldn\'t re-unite with the same Earth that \ngave them birth. 15 The Egyptian traveler Sinuhe felt the approach of \ndeath and hurried home to his motherland "to follow the Lady of All," \nhoping that she would "spend eternity by my side." 16 \n\nPost-mortem reunion with the Mother always overlapped with \nthe idea of marrying her. Man seldom distinguished clearly between his \nthree roles as the Goddess\'s child, corpse, and bridegroom. Balkan \npeasants still view death as a sacred marriage, and dress corpses as for a \nwedding. Formal dirges say: "The black earth for my wife I took." \nAncient Greek epitaphs similarly proclaimed the dead man "admitted to \nthe bridal chamber of Persephone." Artemidorus wrote: "All the \naccompaniments of marriage are exactly the same as those of death." 17 \n\nThe archetypal image of the marriage-with-Earth had a curious \nrevival in the special mid- Victorian pornography known as pornoto- \npia, in which the female body was a landscape, and man \ncorrespondingly reduced in fantasy to about the size of a fly: \n\nIn the middle distance there looms a large irregular shape. On the horizon \nswell two immense snowy white hillocks; these are capped by great, \npink, and as it were prehensile peaks or tips as if the rosy-fingered dawn \nitself were playing just behind them. The landscape undulates gently \ndown to a broad, smooth, swelling plain, its soft rolling curves broken only \nin the lower center by a small volcanic crater or omphalos. Farther \ndown, the scene narrows and changes in perspective. Off to the right and \nleft jut two smooth snowy ridges. Between them, at their point of \njuncture, is a dark wood . . . sometimes it is called a thicket . . . triangular \nin shape. It is also like a cedarn cover, and in its midst is a dark romantic \nchasm. In this chasm the wonders of nature abound. From its top there \ndepends a large, pink stalactite, which changes shape, size, and color in \naccord with the movement of the tides below and within. Within the \nchasm which is roughly pear-shaped there are caverns measureless \n\n\n\n265 \n\n\n\nEarth to man, grottoes, hermits\' caves, underground streams a whole internal \n\nand subterranean landscape. The climate is warm but wet. Thunder- \n\n^^__^^___^^^^_ storms are frequent in this region, as are tremors and quakings of the \n\nearth. The walls of the cavern often heave and contract in rhythmic \nviolence, and when they do the salty streams that run through it double \ntheir flow. The whole place is dark yet visible.

IS \n\nMarcus attributes these images of pornotopia to a spiritual loss, \npossibly related in a direct way to contemporary denial of the earth- \nmother figure in a religious symbolism, as well as Victorian society\'s \nsuppression of sexuality: \n\nOne gets the distinct impression, after reading a good deal of this \nliterature, that it could only have been written by men who at some \npoint in their lives had been starved. . . . Inside of every pornographer \nthere is an infant screaming for the breast from which he has been torn. \nPornography represents an endless and infinitely repeated effort to recap- \nture that breast, and the bliss it offered. \' 9 \n\nAcquisitiveness seems to have been another manifestation of the \nhidden psychic hunger for possession of Mother Earth. Her European \nnames Urth, Hertha, Eortha, Erda, Hretha, etc. stemmed from \nSanskrit Artha, " materia] wealth." Among the Hindu-rooted gypsies, \n"earth" meant good luck, fortune, money. 20 Latin Mater (Mother) \nbecame English "matter," of which Plutarch said, "Matter hath the \nfunction of mother and nurse . . . and containeth the elements from \nwhich everything is produced." 21 Tibetans still say the elements are \nproduced by the Old Mother. 22 The material body has the special \nname of Anna-Maya, variations of which appeared everywhere in the \nancient Mediterranean world as names of the Great Goddess. 23 The \n"soul manifested in matter" is defined as the Anna-Maya self. The sages \nsay, "Mind and matter are at base one as modes of the same Power. \n. . . Mind is the subjective and Matter the objective aspect of the one \npolarized Consciousness." 24 \n\nWestern theology split this former unity into a duality, regarding \nmatter (or flesh) and mind (or spirit) as intrinsically different from, \nand opposed to, one another. Thus, says Jung, "the word \'matter\' \nremains a dry, inhuman, and purely intellectual concept, without any \npsychic significance for us. How different was the former image of \nmatter the Great Mother that could encompass and express the \nprofound emotional meaning of Mother Earth." 25 \n\nAfter the image of Mother Earth as birth-giver, perhaps that of \nMother Earth as receiver of the dead aroused the most profound \nemotional responses. When death was viewed as a return to the infantile \nstate of sleep in the Mother\'s bosom, it seemed less terrifying. The \nRig Veda says, "Crawl to your Mother Earth. She will save you from \nthe void." 26 In medieval ballads, the hero\'s lady-love sometimes \nimpersonated Mother Earth by covering her lover with her green \n\n\n\n266 \n\n\n\nmantle, to put him "out of sight" as if buried. 27 Greek peasants Easter \n\nthought the worst kind of curse on an enemy was to wish Mother Earth \n\nwould not accept him: "May the earth not digest thee! May the black ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nearth spew thee up! May the ground not consume thee!" 28 Such a one \n\nrejected by the earth would be a revenant or a restless ghost. \n\nIn France during the 12th century, a sect of heretics were sent to \nthe stake by the Archbishop of Reims, apparently for worshipping \nMother Earth, among other offenses. Led to execution, one of them \n"cried again and again, \'O Earth, cleave asunder!\'" His hearers \nthought he was trying to get the earth to swallow his enemies, but he \nmay have believed the earth could open and swallow him to save him \nfrom the stake. 29 Like the original death aspect of Rhea or Cerridwen, \nMother Earth still was supposed to devour her children. \n\n1.

Coulton, 55. \n\n\n\nEaster \n\nSpringtime sacrificial festival named for the Saxon Goddess Eostre, \nor Ostara, a northern form of Astarte. Her sacred month was Eastre- \nmonath, the Moon of Eostre. 1 \n\nSaxon poets apparently knew Eostre was the same Goddess as \nIndia\'s Great Mother Kali. Beowulf spoke of "Ganges\' waters, whose \nflood waves ride down into an unknown sea near Eostre\'s far home." 2 \n\nThe Easter Bunny was older than Christianity; it was the Moon- \nhare sacred to the Goddess in both eastern and western nations. \nRecalling the myths of Hathor- Astarte who laid the Golden Egg of the \nsun, Germans used to say the hare would lay eggs for good children \non Easter Eve. 3 (See Cat.) \n\nLike all the church\'s "movable feasts," Easter shows its pagan \norigin in a dating system based on the old lunar calendar. It is fixed as \nthe first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox, \nformerly the "pregnant" phase of Eostre passing into the fertile \nseason. The Christian festival wasn\'t called Easter until the Goddess\'s \nname was given to it in the late Middle Ages. 4 (See Menstrual \nCalendar.) \n\nThe Irish kept Easter on a different date from that of the Roman \nchurch, probably the original date of the festival of Eostre, until the \nRoman calendar was imposed on them in 632 a.d. Nevertheless, the \nColumban foundation and their colonies in Britain kept the old date \nfor another fifty years. 5 \n\nThe Persians began their solar New Year at the spring equinox, \n\n\n\n267 \n\n\n\nEcclesia and up to the middle of the 1 8th century they still followed the old \n\ncustom of presenting each other with colored eggs on the occasion. 6 \n\n^ m ^^^^ m Eggs were always symbols of rebirth, which is why Easter eggs were \n\nusually colored red the life-color especially in eastern Europe. Rus- \nsians used to lay red Easter eggs on graves to serve as resurrection \ncharms. 7 In Bohemia, Christ was duly honored on Easter Sunday and \nhis pagan rival on Eastern Monday, which was the Moon-day \nopposed to the Sun-day. Village girls like ancient priestesses sacrificed \nthe Lord of Death and threw him into water, singing, "Death swims \nin the water, spring comes to visit us, with eggs that are red, with yellow \npancakes, we carried Death out of the village, we are carrying \nSummer into the village." 8 \n\nAnother remnant of the pagan sacred drama was the image of the \ngod buried in his tomb, then withdrawn and said to live again. The \nchurch instituted such a custom early in the Middle Ages, apparently in \nhopes of a reportable miracle. A small sepulchral building having \nbeen erected and the consecrated host placed within, a priest was set to \nwatch it from Good Friday to Easter Sunday. Then the host was \ntaken out and displayed, and the congregation was told Christ was \nrisen. 9 \n\nA curious 16th-century Easter custom was known as "creeping to \nthe cross with eggs and apples," a significant use of the ancient \nfemale symbols of birth and death, beginning and fruition, the opening \nand closing of cycles. The Ceremonial of the Kings of England \nordered carpets to be laid in the church, for the comfort of the king, \nqueen, and courtiers as they crept down the aisle on hands and \nknees. 10 The penitential implication of the creeping ceremony is clear \nenough, but the female-symbolic foodstuffs are a bit mysterious. \n\nGermany applied to Easter the same title formerly given to the \nseason of the sacred king\'s love-death, Hoch-Zeit, "the High Time." \nIn English too, Easter used to be called "the Hye-Tide." n From these \ntitles came the colloquial description of any festival holiday as "a high \nold time." \n\n1.

Holy \nMother Church was both bride and mother of God, according to \nChristian mystics, postulating even an incestuous Sacred Marriage in \nthe old pagan style. The erotic poetry of Solomon\'s Song was glossed \nas an expression of the love between Christ and "Ecclesia." Irenaeus \nsaid Mary-Ecclesia was "the pure womb which regenerates man unto \n\n\n\n268 \n\n\n\nGod." As in the manner of pagan temples, even the church building \nwas likened to Mary\'s body. \n\n\n\nEcho \nEden \n\n\n\nEcho \n\nGreek "nymph" at whose reflecting pool Narcissus met his death. \nAccording to the classical myth, Echo grieved so sorely for her beloved \nflower-god that she pined away until there was nothing left of her but \nher voice. \n\nOriginally, she was Acco, the pre-Hellenic birth-goddess, in an \noracular mood as "the last echo of the Voice," meaning the Voice of \nCreation, the same as the Goddess Vac in ancient India (see Logos). In \nHebrew she was Bath Kol, Daughter of the Voice. 1 \n\nApparently the Word she spoke to the springtime god Narcissus- \nAntheus-Adonis-Hyacinthus was the death curse heralding the final \nphase of the sacred king\'s fatal drama; for Narcissus was the same god as \nDionysus with all his flower-titles. 2 \n\n1. Leland, 220. 2. Graves, G.M. 1, 288. \n\n\n\nIrenaeus Doctor, \nsaint, and father of the \nchurch, said to have \nlived in the 2nd century \na.d. as bishop of \nLyons. His history is \nobscure, largely \nbased on (possibly \nfraudulent) assertions \nof Eusebius, who \nclaimed to have \nletters from Irenaeus, \nbut none of these \nwere preserved. The \nstory of Irenaeus\'s \nmartyrdom has been \nproved false. \n\n\n\nEcstasy \n\nGreek ekstasis meant "standing forth naked," a word for the state of \n\nmind ensuing in a religious trance when the consciousness was stripped \nI away, leaving only the essential self. In Greece as in ancient India, \n\nproper worship was sometimes conducted in a state of physical naked- \nIness (Hindu digambara) to symbolize purification from all \n\ndistractions, to concentrate on the ecstatic experience. \n\n\n\nEdda \n\n"Great-Grandmother," a Norse name for Mother Earth (Erda); also \nthe word for sacred poetry inspired by her. Icelandic sagas or Eddas \nusually opened with an invocation to this Goddess, who gave birth to \nthe oldest third of the human race. 1 \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 150. \n\n\n\nsbrew "Garden of Delight," based on the Persian Heden or primal \nrden where the first couple were joined together as a bisexual being in \nGolden Age. Like all images of the earthly paradise, Eden was \nated in the far west originally, where the sun went each night. That is \nly the Bible says known lands lay "east of Eden" (Genesis 4:16). \n\n\n\n269 \n\n\n\nEdmund, Saint Edmund, Saint \n\nEgg-and-Dart Frieze \n\n\n\nCanonized form of the heathen deity worshipped at Bury St. Ed- \nmunds, where he was seasonally slain, like Shiva, in the shape of a white \nbull. \n\nRitual bull-killing dated back to the Cretan Minotaur cult, through \nrites of Artemis Tauropolos, the Roman Taurobolium, and via \nIberian paganism up to the bullfights of modern Spain. St. Edmund\'s \nshrine was supposedly founded on the tomb of the saint, a young \nman who became "chosen king" of the East Angles in the 9th century. 1 \nBut his legend was wholly mythological. Like other Celtic savior-gods \nhe was tied to a tree and pierced by many arrows: the same fate meted \nout to the sacrificial bull, still demonstrated by Spanish picadors. On \nEdmund\'s heraldic crest, the martyr\'s head was held by a wolf, the \ntraditional Doorkeeper of Death, and the Triple Goddess appeared \nsymbolically in the shape of three Crowns. (See Dog.) \n\nMonastic records reveal the true totemic nature of "St. Edmund." \nA white bull was chosen each year to be paraded through the streets, \nwhile women wishing to conceive would caress him, for a doomed god \nwas usually credited with great fertilizing power. A contract paper \nfrom the monastery said: "This indenture certifies that Master John \nSwassham, sacrist, with the consent of the prior of the convent . . . \nshall find, or cause to be found, one white bull every year of his term, so \noften as it shall happen that any gentlewoman, or any other woman, \nfrom devotion or vows made by them shall visit the tomb of the glorious \nmartyr St. Edmund to make oblation to the same white bull." 2 \n\n1. Attwater, 109. 2. Briffault 3, 190. \n\n\n\nE gg \n\nMystical symbol of the Creatress, whose World Egg contained the \nuniverse in embryo. Orphics said the Great Goddess of darkness, \nMother Night, first brought forth the World Egg which was identi- \nfied with the moon. Heaven and earth were made of the two halves of \nthe eggshell, and the first deity to emerge was the bisexual Eros the \nDesired. The Egg was a common Oriental image of creation. Its \nwestern versions "went back to cosmologies of the Tiamat-type and \nto early exchanges between Greece and the East." \' Egyptians\' signs for \nthe World Egg was the same as for an embryo in a woman\'s womb. \n\n1. Lindsay, O. A., 116. \n\n\n\nEgg-and-Dart Frieze \n\nClassical architectural decoration sometimes called the Frieze of \nVenus and Mars: a symbol of the magic circle alternating men and \nwomen. On the frieze, ovals alternate with trident-shaped darts, \n\n\n\n270 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nfemale and male genital emblems. Ancient builders carried the frieze all Eide \n\nthe way around a building or room without a break, since an El \n\ninterruption in the frieze could mean a break in the succession of i_^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhuman generations. \n\nThe same design in Egypt presented even more overtly sexual \nhieroglyphs: downward-pointing phalli alternating with narrow man- \ndorlas (female almond shapes), each topped by a small triangle \nrepresenting a clitoris. 1 \n\nThe Tantric "magic circle" or chakra was a human equivalent of \nthe Egg-and-Dart frieze. In pagan Britain, druidic priests also worked \nin magic circles alternating with green-robed dignitaries known as \nOvates, or Eggs. 2 Wearing the color associated with Life in druidic \nreligion, these must have been priestesses, like the eastern shaktis, or \nelse men impersonating women by wearing female dress. \n\nMany counting-games originated with the magic circle, in which \nthe even numbers were assigned to men, the odd numbers to \nwomen. Pagan traditions said odd numbers represented "immortality" \nbecause all odd numbers are female. 3 This explains why Roman \nreligious festivals were scheduled for odd-numbered days, on the theory \nthat these days were more propitious. \n\n1 .

Aristotle was one of the first philosophers to attempt \nreplacing this ancient notion of Mother-given intelligence with a \ndoctrine of astral theology. 1 \n1. Lindsay, O.A., 102. \n\n\n\nEire var. Erin \n\nCeltic name of Ireland, from "the Lady Eriu," or Erinn, the Triple \nGoddess. 1 She was a form of Hera, whose apple-isle was located on an \nisland in the western sea. 2 \n\n1. Squire, 126. 2. Graves, G.M. 1, 93. \n\n\n\nEl \n\nGeneral Semitic word or name for a deity, especially in combining \nforms, as Isra-el, Beth-el, Dani-el, El-ijah. Both El and its plural, \nelohim, meaning many deities of both sexes, are the Hebrew words \nrendered "God" by biblical translators. Sometimes "God" is Elias, a \nHebraic version of the sun (Greek Helios); this was the "father" Jesus \n\n\n\n271 \n\n\n\nElaine \nElements \n\n\n\naddressed (Matthew 27:47-49). In Phoenicia, El was the Heavenly Bull \nat the head of the pantheon, spouse of Asherah as Cow-Mother. He \nusually appeared as a human figure wearing the head or horns of a bull. \n\n\n\nvar. Elen, Hel-Aine, \nEileen \n\n\n\nElaine \n\nBritain\'s "Lily Maid," the virgin Moon-goddess bearing the same \nname as Helen of Troy; British tradition claimed the islands were \ncolonized by Trojans. According to the bards, the Roman emperor \nacquired Britain only by marrying its queen, Elen. The people agreed to \nhelp build Roman roads because she ordered them, and the roads \nwere called Roads of Elen of the Hosts: "The men of the Island of \nBritain would not have made those great hostings for any save for \nher." 1 \n\nElen or Elaine became the mother-bride of Lancelot-Galahad in \nArthurian romance. Lancelot the father begot on her his own \nreincarnation, Galahad the son; but Lancelot in his youth had been \nnamed Galahad, and his mother was Queen Elaine. The Lily Maid \ngave Lancelot her sexual-symbolic charm to make him invincible: her \npearl-bedewed sleeve of red silk. The womb-symbol of the Holy \nGrail was displayed in her castle, tended by her dove-soul, Colombe. \nGalahad saw this vision again in his last moments, as he expired at the \naltar in ancient sacred-king style. 2 \n\n1. Mabinogion, 85. 2. Malory I, 377; 2, 268. \n\n\n\nElectra \n\nOne of the Seven Sisters (see Pleiades); virgin mother of Dardanus, \nfounder of Troy, whose name is still borne by the Dardanelles. Electra \nwas also known as a sea nymph. Myths of the classic period made her \na "daughter" of two queens responsible for their husbands\' ritual \nmurders, Queen Clytemnestra and Queen Jocasta, who brought \ndeath to Agamemnon and Oedipus, respectively. Electra\'s name means \n"amber," and may have been applied to a priestess who wore certain \namulets of amber as a badge of office. \n\n\n\nElements \n\nOn each of the inhabited continents, the same four elements were \ndistinguished as building-blocks of all substances living or dead, organic \nor inorganic: water, fire, earth, and air. Indians of Missouri and New \nMexico, Aztecs, Chinese, Hindus, ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Ro- \nmans all had the same idea. 1 The earliest known literate \ncivilization, Sumeria, had already designated the elements water, fire, \nearth, and air. 2 The "science" of western Europe continued to \n\n\n\n272 \n\n\n\nbelieve in the same mystic elements up to the 18th century when real \nelements began to be discovered. \n\nIndo-European tradition said the four elements were created by \nGreat Mother Kali, who organized them into letter-mantras carved \non her rosary of skulls, to form the Sanskrit alphabet, which she invested \nwith power to create what it expressed. Elemental sounds were \ndivided into four categories: Va, water; Ra, fire; La, earth; and Ya, air. \nThey were bound together by the Mother-syllable Ma (Kali Ma \nherself), representing "intelligence." 3 Tibetan Buddhists still say the \nelements are ruled by "Old Mother Khon-Ma," the Great Goddess. 4 \n\nThe Goddess was addressed in scriptures: "Thou art Earth, Thou \nart Water, Thou art Fire, Thou art Air, Thou art the Void, Thou art \nconsciousness itself, Thou art life in this world; Thou art the knowledge \nof self, and Thou art the Supreme Divinity." 5 The ancient theory of \nthe human body\'s elemental "humors," adopted by the medical profes- \nsion in the west up to the 1 9th century, was based on Kali\'s supposed \ndistribution of elements in living forms. She gave water to create the \nblood stream, fire to make its vital heat, earth to produce the solid \nparts of the body, and air to animate it with breath. 6 \n\nThis theory was earnestly adopted by western philosophers. Firmi- \ncus Maternus said man is a microcosm "under the direction of \nNature ... so that within the small compass of his body he might bestow \nunder the requirements of Nature the whole energy and substance of \nthe elements." 7 \n\nThe same elemental symbols shown in the four hands of Kali \nappeared in western iconography also. Kali\'s bowl of blood signified \nwater; her scepter or dorje (lightning bolt) was fire; her lotus wheel \nstood for earth; and her sword was air. The Greeks assigned their \nown versions of these symbols to the Goddess Nemesis (Fate): a cup; an \napple-bough or wand; a wheel; and a sword. 8 Later in European \nhistory, the same symbols of the elements gave rise to the four suits of \nthe Tarot deck: (1) cups; (2) wands, rods, or scepters; (3) pentacles, \ncoins, or discs; and (4) swords. These in turn evolved into the modern \nhearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades. \n\nThe two colors now allotted to the four suits of cards echo the very \nancient Tantric concept of two sexes expressing themselves as ele- \nments. Female water and earth were paired with male fire and air. \nOriental sages maintained that mantras with a preponderance of fiery \nor airy (male) letters are cruel and destructive. Mantras with a prepon- \nderance of watery or earthy (female) letters are benevolent. 9 Like the \ncorresponding card suits in red, the life-color, female elements were said \nto possess the active, life-giving energy. Greek philosophers later \nreversed this opinion, calling male elements "active" and female ele- \nments "passive." Yet, even in the Christian Middle Ages, an \naphorism purportedly derived from Moses said, "Only Earth and Water \nbring forth a living soul." 10 \n\nAccording to Thales of Miletus, water was the Arche, the first of \n\n\n\nElements \n\n\n\nThales of Miletus \n\nPythagorean \nphilosopher, said to be \none of the Seven \nWise men of the an- \ncient world. \n\n\n\nH \n\n\n\n273 \n\n\n\nElements the elements, having "mastery" over the others because it represent- \n\ned the abyssal womb. 11 The combination of water and fire as \nh^^^i^^ female-and-male signified a very ancient theory that blood, the basic \nessence of life, was made of sea water infused by magic fire from \nheaven, which made it warm and red, though it still tasted like sea \nwater. Vedic sages sometimes called the combination Kali and Agni. \nThe Goddess, fructified by Agni\'s fire, become the Ocean of Blood \nat the beginning of the world, source of the vitality of all living things \nuntil the day of destruction. "Sacred fire" symbolized sexual passion, \nits heat engendered by fire-from-heaven gods like Agni, Lucifer, He- \nphaestus, Syrian Baal, Heracles-Melkart, Thor-Heimdall, etc. The \nfire god lost his life when he was swallowed up by the all-encompassing \nMother of Waters; sages said he was "quenched in her yoni" like a \nlightning bolt quenched in the sea. 12 (See Lightning.) This image led \nto the Roman belief that the feminine water-element was dangerous \nto men. 13 \n\nOf the other male-female pair, the air-earth combination obviously \nrepresented Father Heaven and Mother Earth, whose separation was \ncaused by their firstborn son, the god who "divided heaven from earth," \nan Oedipal myth known throughout southeastern Asia, Oceania, and \nancient Mesopotamia. \n\nEgyptians assigned a male-and-female pair to each of the primordi- \nal elements as they arose from the undifferentiated Abyss, or womb \n(Ma-Nu). These eight, together with their Great Mother, made up the \nfirst Ennead (Nine Great Deities). 14 Their elemental totems were \nassociated with the four cardinal points, the four winds, the four sides of \na Holy Mountain (pyramid), the four spirits called Sons of Horus \nwho guarded the corners of a temple. 15 These were like the four Princes \nof Heaven revered in China and Japan as guardians of the four \ncardinal directions: a blue dragon in the east, a red bird in the south, a \nwhite tiger in the west, a black warrior in the north. Three animal \nspirits and one human were the same as Egypt\'s "four powers of \nAmenti." 16 The same elemental totems gave rise to the four angels \nof the Apocalypse and the four evangelists, symbolized in Christian \niconography as a bull (earth), lion (fire), serpent (water), and eagle, \nangel, or man (air). \n\nAmerican Indians had remarkably similar elemental symbolism. \nVillages and camps were divided into four quarters or phratries of \nfire, air, water, and earth, each with its colors and totems. For example, \nthe Zunis associated wind with the north, war, and yellow; fire with \nthe south, summer, tillage, and red; water with the west, spring, peace, \nand blue; earth with the east, autumn, magic, and white. Aztec \nelemental totems were the rabbit (north, black, winter, air); the flint \n(south, blue, summer, fire); the house (east, white, autumn, earth); \nand the cane (west, red, spring, water). 17 \n\nNew World mythology postulated four primordial aeons, each \ncorresponding to an element. Sacred histories of Mexico showed that \neach of the former ages was brought to destruction by the same element I \n\n274 \n\n\n\nthat ruled it. 18 "Earth, the world support and base, became the Elements \n\niswallower of things. Air, the breath of life, became a devastating wind. \n\nFire that descends from heaven tempered as the fire-of-life in ^^__^_^_^_ \n\nlifegiving rain came down as a rain of flames. And finally Water, gentle \n\nmothering vehicle of the energies of birth, nourishment, and growth, \n\nbecame a deluge." 19 \n\nThese myths provide a clue to the original invention of the \n\nelements. Of all substances or forces in the world, why should these \n\nfour have been chosen as the basis of all things? The simple answer is \n\nthat the elements represented the only four possible ways other than \n\ncannibalism to dispose of a dead body, thus returning it to an "origin." \n\nA body could be buried in the earth, burned with fire, thrown into \n\nwater, or given to the birds of the air. Each funerary practice was viewed \n\nas a return to the same power that engendered birth. \n\nThe same four methods of corpse-disposal are still practiced all \n\ntogether in Tantric Tibet. Common folk are chopped in pieces and \n\nexposed to carrion birds, as are the Parsees of India and Persia. \n\nWealthier Tibetans are cremated, or buried if death was caused by \n\ndisease. Sometimes, as among the Hindus, corpses are thrown into \nI rivers or lakes. 20 Vedic peoples followed both funerary customs of burial \n\nand cremation, maintaining that Yama, Lord of Death, received the \n\nsoul either way. 21 \n\nSome ancient thinkers tried to classify different nations under \n\nelemental categories, possibly on the basis of funeral customs pre- \ndominating in them. It was said that water-worship belonged to Egypt \nand the Nilotic Goddess; Phrygians were worshippers of "the earth, \nwhich was to them the Great Mother of everything; the Syrians and \nCarthaginians of the air, which they adored under the name of \ncelestial Juno"; and the Persians worshipped fire. 22 \n\nA few traditions listed a fifth element that the Greeks called ether, \n"heavenly," of which the immortal bodies of gods, angels, star-spirits, \nor saints were made. It was changeless, having no part in the eternal flux \nof other elements constantly combining and re-combining. The idea \nof changeless ether was so important to western notions of the immortal \nsoul that it was never abandoned; even today some occultists call it \nthe substance of the "astral body." In the 18th and 19th centuries, \nastronomers believed ether was a gas filling all of outer space. \n\nEtheric spirits were immortal, but the other elements were also \nrepresented by spirits of a superhuman nature; undines (water), \nsalamanders (fire), gnomes (earth), and sylphs (air). Some said these \nwere pre-human races born of the four rivers that flowed from the \nGreat Mother\'s belly in the paradisial age. Elemental colors were \nassociated with these four rivers of feminine nurturing fluids: water, \nblood, honey, and milk. Oriental gemsmiths assigned to them the jewels \nof mystical significance: sapphire or lapis lazuli (water), ruby (blood \nor fire), gold (earth), and silver, crystal, or diamond (air). 2 \' According to \nbiblical symbolism, the female land was made of rivers Milk and \nHoney; the male god or ancient Savior contributed blood and water, the \n\n275 \n\n\n\nElements \n\n\n\nCompendium \n\nMalcficarum A \ntreatise on witches \nand witchcraft compiled \nby Guazzo in 1608. \n\n\n\nMichael \nConstantine Psellus \n\n1 lth-century Byzantine \npolitician, scholar, \nphilosopher, and \ncourtier; author of a \nHistory, poems, and \nletters on many \nsubjects. \n\n\n\nvery same fluids that flowed from the body of Jesus in the "land of \nmilk and honey" (John 19:34). \n\nThe philosophical sect called Stoics after stoicheia, "the ele- \nments" assigned color symbolism, signs of the zodiac, seasons, and \ndeities to the elements. 24 Their system passed into the Roman Circus, \nwhich was divided into four elemental regions with their colors: green \nfor Spring, Earth, Flowers, Terra Mater, and Venus; red for Summer, \nFire, and Mars; blue for Autumn, Water, Heaven, Saturn, and \nNeptune; white for Winter, Air, Zephyrs, and Jupiter. 25 The same \ndeities were still connected with the elements in the 16th century \na.d.: Venus (water), Mars (fire), Jove (earth), and Saturn (air). \n\nThe Compendium MaleEcarum quoted Psellus\'s list of elemental \nspirits in defining various kinds of devils in the Middle Ages. "The \nfirst is the fiery, because these dwell in the upper air and will never \ndescend .... The second is the aerial, because these dwell in the air \naround us. . . . The third is terrestrial . . . some dwell in the fields and \nlead night travelers astray; some dwell in hidden places and caverns. \n. . . The fourth is the aqueous, for these dwell under the water in rivers \nand lakes. . . . They raise storms at sea, sink ships in the ocean, and . . . \nare more often women than men." 26 According to Scot, fire-spirits \ngovern the intellect, water-spirits the instincts and passions: "Fiery \nspirits urge men to contemplation, watery spirits to lust." 27 Sexual \nprejudices entered into these definitions, for the supposed sexual \npolarity of fire and water was never forgotten. \n\nThe human "temperament" came from Latin temperare, "to mix, \nto combine"; temperament was a mixture of elemental "humors" or \nfluids. These were supposed to be controlled by various gods associated \nwith the elements. Thus, a character could be Martial, Jovial, \nSaturnine, or Mercurial. A predominance of blood gave a sanguine \ntemperament; of phlegm, a phlegmatic one; of bile, a melancholic \none; of ether, an ethereal one; and so on. The temperamental mixture \nwas also related to tempor, the time or season, for the elements were \ncategorized also with the four seasons of the year and various configura- \ntions of the stars. 28 These ideas were old even before Rome was built. \nThe legendary ancestor of the Scythians was said to have arranged all \nthings in the world under four elemental symbols that came down \nfrom heaven: a plough (earth), a bowl (water), an ax (fire), and a yoke \n(air, the "yoke" between heaven and earth, related to the word \nyoga). 19 In general, the lore of the elements was a prime example of \nwhat may be one of humanity\'s most characteristic behavior patterns: \nclassifying. \n\nI.

After dispatching his victim, Shiva put on ^^^^^^^ \n\nthe elephant\'s skin and turned himself elephantine, while "watched \n\n| by the Goddess-spouse." \' In the erotic poem Song of the Cowherd, the \n\ni god was incarnated as Krishna and the Goddess-spouse as his sexually \n\ninsatiable consort Radha, "She-Elephant." Radha was named for an \n\nelephant because elephants were common symbols of the most \n\npowerful sexual energies. The Kama Sutra designated "elephant men" \n\nand "elephant women" those with the largest genitals and most \n\nvoracious sexual appetites. Yet Radha was entirely human, described as \n\nWoman, "the object of devotion to which even God, the Creator \n\nhimself, bows down." 2 \n\nA male elephant was often given the title of Begetter, or Father, or \nGrandfather. 3 Buddha was begotten on the virgin Maya by the \nelephant god under his title of Ganesha, "Lord of Hosts," most \nprobably derived from the use of elephants in warfare. 4 Every history \nstudent knows North African war leaders considered the magic of \nelephants so essential to victory that the Carthaginian general Hanni- \npal insisted on trying to take them over the Alps to attack Rome from \nthe north a disastrous tactical misjudgment, resulting in the loss of \nall his elephants and his war as well. \n\nThe elephant-god "Lord of Hosts" had a flourishing worship in \nNorth Africa and Egypt, which is why this same title was taken by the \n[biblical Yahweh, who was identified with the elephant god at his sacred \npity of Elephantine during the 5th century B.C. 5 Jewish mercenary \nsoldiers stationed there insisted that their god was the same as the \nklephant-mate of the Virgin Mother Neith, or Anath: the two of \npern were totemized as Cow and Bull Elephant at what was then called \npe source of the Nile. 6 Elephants were worshipped as sexual- \npymbolic deities in Egypt from an early date. Totem standards showing \nelephants, and artifacts of elephant ivory, appeared in pre-dynastic \n(times. 7 \n\nJudeo-Christian scholars tended to ignore Yahweh\'s involvement \nIn the elephant cult because, as Hooke says, "it is naturally repugnant \nto most people [i.e., men] to entertain the suggestion that Jahveh could \never have been thought of as possessing a female consort like all the \npaals of Canaan"; and for no more reason than this allegedly natural \nrepugnance, evidence of the sacred marriage at Elephantine was \nsuppressed. Yet the same author admitted that Jahveh was once one of \nthe very same Baals, and even addressed as Baal in the Bible. 8 \n\nA curious parallel to the Flight into Egypt of Yahweh\'s son is \nfound in Buddhist iconography. The Virgin Mother was shown \nriding a white bull, led by Shiva in the costume of a peasant, holding in \ntier arms the elephant-headed Divine Child, the reborn Ganesha. 9 \nPossibly the original Egyptian version of this reborn god entered the \nBible under the name of Behemoth, who became an elephant- \nlieaded demon in the later mythology of western Europe. \n\n277 \n\n\n\nElias, Saint The elephant still symbolizes the sacred marriage in a Buddhist \n\nElizabeth, Saint fertility ritual. Monks lead a painted white elephant in solemn \n\nmm ^^^ ma ^^am^m procession, attended by men wearing women\'s clothes and making \nsalacious jokes. "Through this ritualistic female disguise they do \nhonor to the cosmic female principle, the maternal, procreative, feeding \nenergy of nature, and by the ritualistic utterance of licentious lan- \nguage stimulate the dormant sexual energy of the living power." 10 The \nsame transvestism and lewd language can be found in fertility rituals \nthe world over. \n\n1.

Eusebius built upon the name alone a nonsensical Christian \nmyth, calling Elias one of five Egyptians who were "questioned" at the \ngate of Caesarea and gave their names and their city, Jerusalem. \n"The governor ordered them to be tortured to exhort more precise \ninformation; but they remained mute and were beheaded." 2 \n\nl.Lawson, 44. 2.

She was a mother at 14, \na widow at 20, and a corpse at 24, having died of an excess of \nChristianity. \n\nHer spiritual advisor was Conrad von Marburg, who loved to strip \nboth Elizabeth and her maids and mercilessly whip them for the \nslightest infraction of his orders. On one occasion the young Landgra- \nvine was invited to visit a nunnery and went without asking his \npermission. He beat her so severely that "for three weeks the marks of \nthe cords could be seen upon her." After her husband\'s death, other \nnobles robbed her of her estates and left her destitute; von Marburg \nordered her to send away her last few friends and her children. She \nsaid, "I fear a mortal man as much as I should fear the heavenly Judge. \nTherefore I have given my obedience to Master Conrad . . . that I \nmight be bereft of every earthly consolation." l \n\nShe inflicted further austerities on herself, in addition to the abuse \nshe received from von Marburg, and soon died of these physical \nhardships. Conrad von Marburg pulled political strings to have her \n\n\n\n278 \n\n\n\ncanonized, to enhance his own reputation as her teacher. He busied \nhimself in the torture chamber a task plainly suited to his personal- \nityand was credited with bringing 8000 heretics to the stake in a \nsingle year. At last he was assassinated by a group of irate knights, \nagainst whom he had preached a crusade. 2 He was promptly canon- \nized as a saint and a martyr. 5 \n\n1. de Voragine, 684. 2.

In \nthe original manuscripts of the book of Genesis, Yahweh was only \none of the elohim. Sometimes the singular form was taken as a name, \ne.g. the Phoenician bull-god called simply El, "the god." l \n\nMedieval wizards thought Elohim was one of the magical secret \nnames of God; or, at times, it was taken to be the name of a devil. \n\n1 . Lamusse, 74. \n\n\n\nElohim \nElves \n\n\n\nElves \n\nSpenser said the word "elf meant "alive." \' But there is little doubt \nthat elves were the ancestral dead, still "alive" in their burial mounds; "it \nis well known that in Scandinavia the dead were formerly called \n\'elves.\' " 2 The Kormaks Saga, pagan Icelandic poem of the 10th \ncentury, described sacrifices to them for curative purposes: "Redden \nthe outside of the mound with bull\'s blood, and make the elves a feast \nwith the flesh; and you will be healed." 3 \n\nThe paradise of Alfaheimr (Elf-land) was always matriarchal, \ninhabited by the bright female spirits who made the sun. Like their \neastern counterparts the dakinis, these Valkyries or fairies could be \nboth beautiful and hideous, representing both birth and death. 5 In the \nnew creation after doomsday, the new female sun would be Glory-of- \nElves. 6 \n\nChristianity opposed this ancient female-centered theology, as \nshown by accounts of elf-feasts as demonic sabbats where "cloven- \nfooted dancers" trod their fairy rings. Henry More, 17th century \nEnglish philosopher and poet, said they often appeared in northern \nEngland and in Ireland. 7 Ballads merged the demon lover with the "elf- \nknight," a wooer from pagan northlands. 8 The custom of the Wild \nHunt or Night Ride, sacred to the elf-king (Odin), was transformed into \na procession of wind-riding demons, as at Halloween and other \nIpagan festivals. Leader of the night riders was called the Erl King, from \nDanish eherkonge, a king of those who belong to Hel. He associated \nwith the sacred alder tree. 9 \n\n\n\nThe word elf was \nrelated to the helleder, \npeople belonging to \nMother Hel as Death- \ngoddess. In general it \nmeant heathen, both \ndead and living. \nSigvat Thordarson in \nthe 11th century \ncalled heathen people \nalfar, "elves," who \nworshipped their deities \nat feasts called \nalfablot (elf-blood) in \ncertain "heathen- \nholy" houses ruled by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 \n\n\n\nElysium \nEndymion \n\n\n\nOther plants often associated with elves were the holly sacred to \nHel, the mistletoe, the mandrake, and various witch-herbs including \nrosemary, known as the Elfin Plant, 10 named after the Goddess herself. \n(See Rose.) \n\nl.Keightley,57. 2.

It was once thought that male genitals were \nrotruding ends of intestines, literally "testes-within." Egyptian sma \nneant both entrails and male genitals. 1 Egyptians prayed to be delivered \nm the day of reckoning from a Kali-like death-goddess Baba, who not \n>nly "devoured" men sexually but also "feeds on the entrails of the \nlead." 2 \n\nKali devoured her lover genitally and also devoured his entrails at \nfie same time. 5 Similarly, Aphrodite in her Crone form as Andro- \nihonos, Man-Slayer, killed her lovers as a queen bee does by ripping \nut their intestines along with their genitals. 4 In northern Europe \nhere was the same ceremony: spring was brought to the world by \npibolically ripping out the entrails of Loki via a rope tied around his \nenitals. His blood bathed the lap (womb) of the Goddess; then she \npiled, and the spring could come. 5 See Skadi. \n\nBecause men\'s "guts" were supposed to possess the spirit of the \n\nhallic god, also mythologized as the underground serpent, it was \n\nsual to take omens from the entrails of sacrificial victims. Among the \n\nLmazonian tribes of the Black Sea area, the readers of entrails were \n\nold gray-haired women." 6 The Romans called similar diviners haruspi- \n\n(es, "those who gaze into the belly." 7 \n\n1.

Jesus, John the Baptist, and Simon Magus were said to have \nbeen trained in Essenic communities, which formed the bulk of the \nfirst Christians. Epiphanius said, "They who believed on Christ were \ncalled Essenes before they were called Christians." l \n\nAn Essenic hierarchy included a chief priest called Christos \n(Anointed One), "head of the entire Congregation of Israel." There \nwere ordinary priests called "sons of Aaron," and another functionary \nknown as the Messiah of Israel. 2 The latter was also called Teacher of \nRighteousness. He suffered physical abuse in atonement for the sins of \nthe entire community, enduring "vindictive sentences of scourging \nand the terrors of painful sicknesses, and vengeance on his fleshly \nbody."\' \n\nJosephus said the Essenes "reject pleasures as an evil, but esteem \n\n\n\nEpiphanius Sainted \n4th-century father of \nthe church, friend \nof St. Jerome, writer of \nmany tracts and \npolemics against \npaganism. \n\n\n\n283 \n\n\n\nEssenes continence, and the conquest over our passions, to be virtue. They \n\nneglect wedlock, but choose out other persons\' children, while they are \n^^^^^^^ pliable, and fit for learning; and esteem them to be of their kindred, \nand form them according to their own manners." We are not told \nwhether these "other persons\' children" were abandoned by their \nparents, or sold, or given to, or kidnapped by, the Essenes. These harsh \nanchorites imposed cruel sentences for the least infraction of rules, \npartial starvation being the most common punishment. Some suffered \npunishments lasting two or more years for wavering from the doc- \ntrines of the community. 4 \n\nThe doctrines were strikingly similar to those of early Christianity. \nEssenes anticipated St. Augustine in teaching that immortal souls \nbelonged in heaven, but were drawn down to earth and entrapped in \ncorruptible flesh by the "natural enticement" of sex. 5 The soul\'s \npurity might be recovered by ascetic techniques such as mortification of \nthe flesh, fasting, renunciation of sensual pleasures, and by solitary \nmeditation in the wilderness, like the voluntary exiles of John and Jesus. \n\nEssenes called themselves Therapeutae, "healers," claiming their \naustere lifestyle gave them power to cast out demons of sickness, even \nto restore life to the dead; Jesus\'s raising of Lazarus was a typical Essenic \nmiracle. 6 Much of their training as exorcists consisted of learning lists \nof spirits\' names, and the holy names that would expel them. Like Jesus \nin the episode of the Gadarene swine, Essenes always demanded the \ndemons\' names. (See Name.) They were sworn to strictest secrecy \nregarding the magical names they used in their exorcisms. 7 \n\nEssenes preached giving away all one\'s worldly goods upon joining \nthe sect, which meant those who joined gave away everything they \nowned to their superiors. Dire punishments were meted out to those \nwho lied about their possessions in order to hold something back for \nthemselves or their families. 8 An Essenic episode in the Gospels tells of \nAnanias and his wife Sapphira, killed by St. Peter for giving the \napostles only a part, but not all, of the money they received for a sale of \nland. Peter and his associates were jailed for murder, but later escaped \n(Acts 5:2-10, 18). \n\nDespite their vows of poverty, the Essenes were strangely obsessed \nwith visions of wealth and power coming to them after Armageddon, \n"The War of the Sons of Light with the Sons of Darkness." 9 Sons of \nLight of course were the Essenes, and all others outside their \nbrotherhood were Sons of Darkness, otherwise called "men of the \nPit." 10 The Essenes believed firmly in the imminence of the Last \nDays, when they would be called upon to fight the forces of evil. Their \nreward would be to rule the world in an oddly materialistic manner, \nas envisioned by their scriptures: \n\nArise, O Warrior, take thy captives, O glorious man! Seize thy plunder, O \ndoer of mighty deeds! Lay thy hand on the necks of thy enemies and \nthy foot on the heaps of the slain; smite the nations, thy adversaries, and \nmay thy sword devour guilty flesh Let there be a multitude of \n\n\n\n284 \n\n\n\n\n\n\npossessions in thy fields, silver and gold and precious stones in thy palaces. Esther \n\n...Let thy gates be continuously open, that the wealth of the nations \n\nmay be brought unto thee; and let their kings serve thee, and all the _^^^^__^^___ \n\noppressors bow down to thee and lick the dust of thy feet. " \n\nA large colony of Essenes occupied the Qumran community \nfrom 1 10 B.C. to the fall of Jerusalem in 70 a.d. with a significant period \nof vacancy during the reign of Herod, 31-4 B.C. In 31 b.c. the site \nhad to be abandoned because a severe earthquake cracked the water \ncistern and ruined the buildings. 12 \n\nSurvivors evidently took the earthquake as a sign of the oncoming \nLast Days and went forth into the world to preach their message. \nJosephus said before 70 a.d. there were many Messiahs and Christs \nannouncing the end of the world. 15 Some were willing to die a \nmartyr\'s death, believing this would gain them special privileges in the \nworld of the hereafter. One such martyr may have been John the \nBaptist, who came from the wilderness to call Herod and his court to \nrepentance, and remained to serve as a sacred king (see Salome). \n\nEarly Mandaean Christians said the true prophet was not Jesus but \nJohn the Baptist. They called themselves Christians of St. John, and \nalso Nasoraje, or "Nazarenes." H One of the colonies of exiled hermits \nfrom Qumran settled around Nazareth and took up the craft of \ncarpentry; hence the craft-brotherhood of Nazorenes, from najjar, \n"carpenters," after whom the town may have been named. Some \nChristian authorities of the first centuries a.d. wrote that during this \nperiod "all Christians were called Nazorenes." 15 Jesus too was called \na Nazorene. The oldest Gospel called him "Jesus the carpenter" (Mark \n6:3). \n\nOddly, what began in the east as a carpenters\' metaphor passed \ninto the Gospels as a masons\' metaphor. Essene-like Buddhist her- \nmits described themselves as logs rejected by the carpenter\'s craft. 16 The \nsame words were put into Jesus\'s mouth, somewhat altered: he called \nhimself a stone rejected by the masons (Matthew 21:42). \n\n1.

The biblical Book \nof Esther is a secularized Elamite myth of Ishtar (Esther) and her \nconsort Marduk (Mordecai), who sacrificed the god Hammon, or \nAmon (Haman). Yahweh was never mentioned, because the Jews of \nElam worshipped Marduk, not Yahweh. (See Purim.) \n\nEsther probably was the name given to any priestess chosen to \nrepresent the Goddess on the occasion of the king\'s sacred marriage. \n\n\n\n285 \n\n\n\nEthan Even the Bible story admits that Esther-Ishtar was not the real name of \n\nEuphemia, Saint the Elamite-Jewish queen.

He was the Sumerian god-king Etana, called \nEytan in the land of Canaan. He ascended to heaven on eagle-back, \nlike Ganymede, to reach the Goddess and learn the secret of eternal life. \nHe came down again to earth, some said thrown down by the jealous \nsun god for his hubris. 1 Evidently he returned to earth to be reincarnat- \ned in the next king.

Her legend claimed she was one of the \nwomen who entered a Christian sect by "turning herself into a man," \nfor some sects would not admit women unless they did this. 1 St. \nEugenia accordingly became a monk and called herself Brother \nEugenius. The same story told of all she-monks was told of her: she was \nfalsely accused of rape and condemned to a life of expiation, which \nshe patiently endured. Still, the healing miracles attributed to her shrines \nwere older than her Christian legend, showing that she was really the \nGoddess whose "eugenic" springs were even more popular in the 1st \ncentury than Lourdes or Compostela in the 20th. 2 \n\n1 .

She stood aloft on \na high place, and could not be reached except with ladders; those who \nclimbed up to pull her down were afraid, because the first of their \nnumber had been stricken with paralysis upon touching her and was \nborne away half dead. 1 That is, she was a holy image protected by so \nstern a taboo that even early Christians feared to violate it. \n\n1. de Voragine, 552. \n. \n\n\n\nEuropa \nEurynome \n\n\n\nEuropa \n\n"Full Moon," the Great Goddess as mother of the entire continent. \nShe was embodied in the same white Moon-cow as Hathor, Hera, Io, \nand Kali who "rode" Shiva in the guise of the white bull Nandi, \njust as Europa rode Zeus disguised as a white bull. 1 Her Hellenic legend \nsaid Zeus kidnapped and raped her; but it was "deduced from pre- \nHellenic pictures of the Moon-priestess triumphantly riding on the \nSun-bull, her victim." 2 Garlanded white bulls were sacrificed to the \nlunar cow-goddess in Crete and Mycenae from a very early date. \nAccording to Pausanias, Europa was a surname of the ancient \nMycenaean goddess, Demeter.* \n\n1.

He too \nbecame too arrogant and had to be punished for forgetting his Mother. 2 \nSee Eve. \n\nLike many titles of the Great Goddess, Eurynome was both \ndiabolized and masculinized by later Christian writers, who con- \nsigned her to hell and made her a male "demon Eurynome," sometimes \ndescribed as a Prince of Death. 3 \n\n1.

She was also known in India as Jiva or leva, \nthe Creatress of all manifested forms. 1 In Assyrian scriptures she was \nentitled Mother- Womb, Creatress of Destiny, who made male and \nfemale human beings out of clay, "in pairs she completed them." 4 \nThe first of the Bible\'s two creation myths gives this Assyrian version, \nsignificantly changing "she" to "he" (Genesis 1:27). \n\nThe original Eve had no spouse except the serpent, a living \nphallus she created for her own sexual pleasure. 5 Some ancient \npeoples regarded the Goddess and her serpent as their first parents. 6 \nSacred icons showed the Goddess giving life to a man, while her \nserpent coiled around the apple tree behind her. 7 Deliberate misinter- \npretation of such icons produced ideas for revised creation myths like \nthe one in Genesis. Some Jewish traditions of the first century B.C., \nhowever, identified Jehovah with the serpent deity who accompanied \nthe Mother in her garden. 8 Sometimes she was Eve, sometimes her \nname was given as Nahemah, Naama, or Namrael, who gave birth to \nEve and Adam without the help of any male, even the serpent. 9 \n\nBecause Jehovah arrogantly pretended to be the sole Creator, Eve I \nwas obliged to punish him, according to Gnostic scriptures. Though \nthe Mother of All Living existed before everything, the God forgot she j \nhad made him and had given him some of her creative power. "He \nwas even ignorant of his own Mother. ... It was because he was foolish \nand ignorant of his Mother that he said, \'I am God; there is none \nbeside me.\'" Gnostic texts often show the creator reprimanded and \npunished for his arrogance by a feminine power greater and older \nthan himself. 10 \n\nThe secret of God\'s "Name of power," the Tetragrammaton, \nwas that three-quarters of it invoked not God, but Eve. YHWH, yod- \nhe-vau-he, came from the Hebrew root HWH, meaning both "life" \nand "woman" in Latin letters, E-V-E. 16 With the addition of an I \n\n\n\n288 \n\n\n\n(yod), it amounted to the Goddess\'s invocation of her own name as the \nWord of creation, a common idea in Egypt and other ancient lands. 17 \nGnostic scriptures said Adam was created by the power of Eve\'s \nword, not God\'s. She said, "Adam, live! Rise up upon the earth!" As \nsoon as she spoke the word, her word became reality. Adam rose up and \nopened his eyes. "When he saw her, he said, \'You will be called "the \nmother of the living," because you are the one who gave me life.\'" 18 \n\nAdam\'s name meant he was formed of clay moistened with blood, \nthe female magic oiadamah or "bloody clay." 19 He didn\'t produce \nthe Mother of All Living from his rib; in earlier Mesopotamian stories, \nhe was produced from hers. (See Birth-giving, Male.) His Babylo- \nnian predecessor Adapa (or Adamu) was deprived of eternal life not by \nthe Goddess, but by a hostile God. \n\nThe biblical idea was a reversal of older myths in which the \nGoddess brought forth a primal male ancestor, then made him her \nmate the ubiquitous, archetypal divine-incest relationship traceable in \nevery mythology. The reversal was not even original with biblical \nauthors. It was evolved by Aryan patriarchs who called Brahma the \nprimal male ancestor. They claimed their god brought forth the \nMother of All Living from his own body, then mated with her, so she \ngave birth to the rest of the universe. 20 In the Hebraic version, a \nwombless God made his offspring with his hands, and the actual birth- \ngiving was left to Adam. The Bible as revised by patriarchal scribes \nsaid nothing about a divine birth-giving, since the scribes were deter- \n\nined to separate the concepts of "deity" and "mother" insofar as \npossible. \n\nGnostic scriptures however reverted to the older tradition and \nsaid Eve not only created Adam and obtained his admission to heaven; \nshe was the very soul within him, as Shakti was the soul of every \nHindu god and yogi. Adam couldn\'t live without "power from the \nMother," so she descended to earth as "the Good Spirit, the \nThought of Light called by him \'Life\' (Hawwa)." She entered into \nAdam as his guiding spirit of conscience: "It is she who works at the \ncreature, exerts herself on him, sets him in his own perfect temple, \nnlightens him on the origin of his deficiency, and shows him his \n(way of) ascent." Through her, Adam was able to rise above the \ngnorance imposed on him by the male God. 21 \n\nBy this Gnostic route came the Midrashic assertion that Adam and \nSve were originally androgynous, like Shiva and his Shakti. She dwelt \nn him, and he in her; they were two souls united in one body, which \n3od later tore apart, depriving them of their bliss of union. Cabalists \nook up the idea and said the paradise of Eden can be regained only \nrvhen the two sexes are once more united; even God must be united \nvith his female counterpart, the heavenly Eve called Shekina. 22 \n\nAnother Gnostic version of the story made God a true villain, who \nursed Adam and Eve and expelled them from paradise out of \nealousy of their happiness. He also lusted after the Virgin Eve, raped \nler, and begot her sons Jahveh and Elohim, whose other names were \n\n\n\nEve \n\n\n\nEve was one of the \ncommon Middle- \nEastern names of the \nsuperior feminine \npower. To the \nHittites, she was \nHawwah, "Life." 11 \nTo the Persians, she \nwas Hvov, "the \nEarth." 12 Aramaeans \ncalled her Hawah, \n"Mother of All \nLiving." 13 In \nAnatolia she was Hebat \nor Hepat, with a \nGreek derivative Hebe, \n"Virgin Mother \nEarth," with the same \nrelationship to the \nGreat Goddess Hera as \nKore-Persephone to \nDemeter, and Hebe \nmay have been an \neponymous ancestress \nof "Hebrews." A \nSemitic root of her \nnames was hayy, a \nmatrilineal kinship \ngroup, once \nconsidered the "life" of \nevery tribe by direct \ndescent from the \nCreatress. H The \nnames of Eve, the \nSerpent, and "Life" \nare still derived from the \nsame root in \nArabic. 15 \n\n\n\n289 \n\n\n\nEve \n\n\n\nSt. John Chrysostom, \n\n"Golden-mouthed \nJohn," 4th-century \nChristian orator who \nserved as Patriarch of \nConstantinople until he \nincurred the wrath of \nthe empress Eudoxia, \nwho arranged to \nhave him deposed and \nexiled. \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens Ter- \ntullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Car- \nthage of pagan parents. \n\n\n\nCain and Abel. Here was one of several myths that made Eve the \nmother not only of Adam, but also of Jehovah, and of all the \nelements as well. The myth went on to say the first of Eve\'s offspring \nruled the male elements of fire and air; the second ruled the female \nelements of earth and water. 23 \n\nLike her prototype Kali Jaganmata, Eve brought forth death as \nwell as life that is, she brought forth all living forms, all of which \nwere subject to death for the very reason that they were alive. Under \npatriarchal systems of belief, the fact that every living thing is doomed \nto die was blamed on the Mother who gave it a finite life. Instead of \nblaming God for casting Adam out of the paradise where he might \nhave lived forever, the patriarchs blamed Eve for bringing this about. \nThe Wisdom of Jesus ben Sirach said evil began with Woman (Eve): \n"because of her we all die." 24 Fathers of the Christian church said Eve \nconceived by the serpent and brought forth Death. The seeds of all \nwomen already existed in Eve, St. John Chrysostom maintained, so that \nin her sin "the whole female race transgressed." 25 \n\nThe Book of Enoch said God created death to punish all humanity \nfor Eve\'s sin, but many patriarchal thinkers hesitated to blame God \neven indirectly. The prevalent opinion was that when Eve disobeyed \nthe deity, death somehow just happened. 26 St. Paul blamed only Eve, \nabsolving Adam from guilt for the apple-eating incident: "Adam was not \ndeceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression" (1 \nTimothy 2:14). A church council announced in 418 a.d. that it was \nheresy to say death was a natural necessity rather than the result of \nEve\'s disobedience. 27 \n\nThis was the real origin of the church fathers\' fear and hatred of \nwomen, which expanded into a sexist attitude that permeated all of \nwestern society: Woman was identified with Death. Her countervailing \nresponsibility for birth was taken away, and the creation of life was \nlaid to the credit of the Father-god, whose priests claimed he could \nremove the curse of death. As every woman was understood to be an \nemanation of Eve, Tertullian said to Everywoman: \n\nAnd do you not know that you are an Eve? The sentence of God on this \nsex of yours lives in this age; the guilt must of necessity live too. You \nare the devil\'s gateway . . . the first deserter of the divine law; you are she \nwho persuaded him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack. \nYou destroyed so easily God\'s image, man. On account of your desert | \nthat is, death, even the Son of God had to die. 28 \n\nMedieval theologians said Adam was forgiven. Christ descended \ninto hell and rescued Adam along with other biblical patriarchs. He \nescorted Adam into heaven, saying, "Peace be to thee and to all the \njust among thy sons." 29 But for Eve there was no forgiveness. No peace \nwas offered to her or her daughters. Presumably, they were left \nbehind in hell. Christian theologians espoused the same theory as \nPersian patriarchs, that heaven was closed to all women except those \nwho were submissive and worshipped their husbands as gods. 30 Even \n\n\n\n290 \n\n\n\nmodern theologians naively blame human death on the Edenic sin. \nRahner said, "Man\'s death is the demonstration of the fact that he has \nfallen away from God Death is guilt made visible." 51 Theolo- \ngians have not yet dealt with the question of what "guilt" causes death \namong non-human creatures. \n\nActually, churches depend for their very existence on the orthodox \nmyth of Eve. "Take the snake, the fruit-tree, and the woman from \nthe tableau, and we have no fall, no frowning Judge, no Inferno, no \neverlasting punishment hence no need of a Savior. Thus the \nbottom falls out of the whole Christian theology." 32 \n\nEqually destructive to Christian theology would be restoration of \nbooks arbitrarily excluded from the canon, such as the Apocalypse of \nAdam, in which Adam stated that he and Eve were created together but \nshe was his superior. She brought with her "a glory which she had \nseen in the aeon from which we had come forth. She taught me a word \nof knowledge. . . . And we resembled the great eternal angels, for we \nwere higher than the God who had created us."" \n\nSome of these once-sacred books made Eve superior to both Adam \nand the creator. It was she, not God, who gave Adam his soul and \nbrought him to life. It was she, not God, who cast down the evil deities \nfrom heaven and made them demons. And she, as the eternal female \nPower, would eventually judge the God she created, find him guilty of \ninjustice, and destroy him. 34 \n\nAs an allegory, this might reflect a social truth. Fragile constructs \nof the collective mind, gods are easily destroyed by those who ignore \nthem. Early Gnostic documents show that most women of the ancient \nworld were disposed to ignore the God who was said to have cursed \ntheir sex and their descendants forever. Had one of the other versions of \nthe Eve myth prevailed over the canonical version, sexual behavior \npatterns in western civilization almost certainly would have evolved \nalong very different lines. Christianity managed to project man\'s fear \nof death onto woman, not to respect her as Kali the Destroyer was \nrespected, but to hate her. \n\nThe uncanonical scriptures were no more and no less creditable \nthan the canonical ones. Their picture of Eve as God\'s stern mother, \nhe defender of mankind against a tyrannical demon-deity, had more \nadherents in the early Christian centuries than the picture that is now \namiliar. One of Christianity\'s best-kept secrets was that the Mother of \nMl Living was the Creatress who chastised God. \n\n1. Avalon, 120, 278. 2. Waddell, 126. 3. d\'Alviella, 153. 4.

At \nfirst he was \naccounted a saint, but \nthree centuries after \nhis death he was \ndeclared a heretic \nbecause of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\n\n\nEvolution \n\nThe theory of species development given to the world by Darwin and \nhis successors had no special religious significance, except that Christian \nauthorities viewed it as a contradiction of their all-important Eden \nmyth, just as Galileo\'s astronomical discoveries contradicted the Bible\'s \ngeocentric cosmos. The theory of evolution showed man could not \nhave "fallen"; there was no original sin and therefore no need of \nsalvation. \n\nIn 1869 a German theologian, Dr. Schund, said, "If Darwin be \nright in his view of the development of man out of a brutal condition, \nthen the Bible teaching in regard to man is utterly annihilated." The \nAmerican Episcopal Church said: "If this hypothesis be true, then is \nthe Bible an unbearable fiction . . . then have Christians for nearly two \nthousand years been duped by a monstrous lie. . . . Darwin requires \nus to disbelieve the authoritative word of the Creator." Another theo- \nlogical heavyweight declared: "If the Darwinian theory is true, \nGenesis is a lie, the whole framework of the book of life falls to pieces, \nand the revelation of God to man, as we Christians know it, is a \ndelusion and a snare." \' \n\nThese gentlemen were right. The theory of evolution does indeed \ncontradict the biblical creation myths and the dogma of the Fall. As \nthe evidence in favor of evolution continued to pile up, fundamentalist \nchurches desperately sought ways to ignore it, or else reconcile the \nirreconcilable. Pope Paul IV spoke on the subject of evolution in 1966: \n\nSuch explanations do not agree with the teaching of Sacred Scripture, \nSacred Tradition, and the Church \'s magisterium, according to which \nthe sin of the first man is transmitted to all his descendants not through \nimitation but through propagation. . . . The theory of evolution will not \nseem acceptable to you whenever it is not decisively in accord with the \nimmediate creation of each and every human soul by God, and \nwhenever it does not regard as decisively important for the fate of \nmankind the disobedience of Adam, the universal first parent. 2 \n\nSince the theory of evolution can never be "decisively in \naccord" with the orthodox view, it can never be accepted by the \n"infallible" church. The orthodox view has remained on the 17th- \ncentury level of Father Mersenne who "expressed the opinion of the \nmost enlightened theologians when he declared that orthodoxy did \nnot fear either science or reason, and was quite prepared to accept all \ntheir conclusions, \'provided they agreed with the Scriptures.\'" 3 \n\nSeventeen hundred years ago, Origen wrote of the Garden of \nEden myth: "No one would be so foolish as take this allegory as a \ndescription of actual fact." 4 But Origen was excommunicated, and \ncountless millions have been precisely that foolish. \n\n1.

Protestant churches don\'t \nexorcise. As far back as 1603 the Church of England forbade ministers \nto cast out devils, though a present-day Archbishop of Canterbury \npublicly confessed a belief in "genuine demonic possession" in 1974. 1 \nThe Roman church maintains the office of exorcist, whose rite of \nordination states: "An Exorcist must cast out devils." 2 The Official New \nCatholic Encyclopedia says, "Today the Church maintains its tradi- \ntional attitude toward exorcism. It recognizes the possibility of diabolical \npossession, and it regulates the manner of dealing with it. \n... A solemn method of exorcising is given in the Roman Ritual." 3 \n\nThis "solemn method" is based on name magic and words of \npower, like exorcisms used by Egyptian wizards thousands of years \nago. It says in part: "I command thee, whosoever thou art, thou unclean \nspirit, and all thy companions possessing this servant of God, that by \nthe Mysteries of the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension \nof our Lord Jesus Christ, by the sending of the Holy Ghost, and by \nthe Coming of the same our Lord to judgment, thou tell me thy name, \nthe day, and the hour of thy going out, by some sign; and, that to me, \na minister of God, although unworthy, thou be wholly obedient in all \nthings." Exorcistic power of chastity is invoked: "The continence of \nthe Confessors commands thee." Inanimate objects can be exorcised in \nthe same manner, as in the consecration of medals: "I exorcise ye, \nmedals, through God the Father Almighty. . . . May the power of the \nadversary, all the host of the Devil, all evil attack, every spirit and \nglamour of Satan, be utterly put to flight and driven far away by the \nvirtue of these medals." 4 \n\nThe history of exorcism often demonstrates legalistic-theological \nbuffoonery at its silliest, as in the many instances of insect pests and \nother vermin verbally assaulted by the exorcist, though paying no \ndiscernible attention to the anathemas that threatened them. In 1478 \nthe authorities of Berne addressed a plague of crop-eating insects, "I \ndeclare and affirm that you are banned and exorcised, and through \nthe power of Almighty God shall be called accursed and shall daily \ndecrease." The insects, however, only continued to increase. In 1516 \nthe Provost of Troyes commanded all caterpillars to "retire within six \ndays from the vineyards and lands of Villenose, threatening them \nwith his solemn curse and malediction if they failed to obey." The \ncaterpillars apparently weren\'t listening. From the 16th century \nonwards, it was a Savoyard custom to excommunicate destructive \ninsects, even though they seemed not to care about being banned \nfrom God\'s congregation. In 1633 the consuls of Strambino summoned \nthe caterpillars "to appear before the bench of reason to show cause \n\n\n\n293 \n\n\n\nEye \n\n\n\nwhy they should not desist from corroding and destroying, under \npenalty of banishment from the place and confiscation." In 1713 the \nFriars Minor in Piedade no Maranho, Brazil, claimed that their exor- \ncism of ants worked, and "by God\'s express order the ants departed to \nanother place." 5 \n\nIn a process against leeches, which was tried at Lausanne in 1451, a \nnumber of leeches were brought into court to hear the notice served \nagainst them, which admonished all leeches to leave the district within \nthree days. The leeches, however, proving contumacious and refusing to \nquit the country, they were solemnly exorcised. . . . The doctors of \nHeidelberg in particular, then a famous seat of learning, not only expressed \ntheir entire and unanimous approbation of the exorcism, but imposed \nsilence on all impertinent meddlers who presumed to speak against it. 6 \n\nWhen used against human beings, the process of exorcism \nproved rather more baneful than absurd, tending to exacerbate the very \nsymptoms it was supposed to relieve.

Moslem \nSyrians called her \nAina Bisha, the eye- \nwitch. \n\n\n\nEye \n\nThe All-Seeing Eye of ancient Egypt once belonged to the Goddess \nof truth and judgment, Maat. 1 The Mother-syllable Maa meant "to \nsee"; in hieroglyphics it was an eye. 2 \n\nA late text transferred the All-Seeing Eye to a male god, Horus, \nand the common symbol came to be known as the Eye of Horus, also \nrepresenting the phallus as the "One-Eyed God." Yet the same Eye \nwas incongruously described as a female judge: "I am the all-seeing \nEye of Horus, whose appearance strikes terror, Lady of Slaughter, \nMighty One." 3 The Eye whose appearance strikes terror was the \noriginal prototype of the evil eye which, like the petrifying glance of \nMedusa, was usually associated with women and was feared by \nsimple folk everywhere, up to the present day. \n\nStaring idols of the Neolithic "Eye Goddess" have been found \nthroughout Mesopotamia. In Syria she was known as the Goddess \nMari, whose huge eyes searched men\'s souls. 4 \n\nLike Moslems, Christians diabolized the female spirit of the All- \nSeeing Eye. Old women were credited with the ancient Goddess\'s \npower to "overlook" to curse someone with a glance. Judges of the \nInquisition so greatly feared the evil eyes of their victims that they \nforced accused witches to enter the court backward, to deprive them of \nthe advantage of a first glance. 6 \n\n\n\n294 \n\n\n\nOddly enough, remedies for the evil eye were often female Eye \n\nsymbols. Necklaces of cowrie shells, those ubiquitous yonic symbols, \n\nwere and are valued in India as charms against the evil eye. The triangle ^^^^^^^^^^_ \nor Yoni Yantra, representing the vulva, is similarly used in India, \nGreece, and the Balkans. Northern Indian farmers protect crops from \nthe evil eye by hanging Kali\'s symbol of a black pot in the field. In \n18th-century England, the classic witch\'s familiar, a black cat, was \nsupposed to afford protection; and sore eyes could be cured by \nrubbing with a black cat\'s tail. 7 In addition there were many signs, \ngestures, and other kinds of counter-spells to be used as instant \nremedies if one suspected having been "overlooked." \n\nIt seems men were very much averse to meeting a direct glance \nfrom a woman. In the most patriarchal societies, from medieval Japan \nto Europe, it was customary to insist that "proper" women keep their \neyelids lowered in the presence of men. In 19th-century Islamic Iran, \nit was believed that every woman above the age of menopause possessed \nthe evil eye. Old women were not permitted in crowds attending \npublic appearances of the Shah, lest his sacred person be exposed to an \nold woman\'s dangerous look. 8 \n\nAny person invested with spiritual powers, however, could be \n\ncredited with the power to curse with a look. Several popes were \n\nreputed to be bearers of the evil eye ox jettatura. Pope Pius IX (d. 1878) \n\nwas a famous jettatore. Pope Leo XIII, his successor, was said to have \n\nthe evil eye because so many cardinals died during his reign. 9 \n\nI. Budge, G.E. 1, 392. 2. Budge, E.L., 55. 3. Cavendish, RE., 167. \n4.

Sometimes \nit was the "never- \nnever" land, perhaps \nafter an Egyptian \nword for paradise, \nnefemefer, "doubly \nbeautiful." The Faroe \nIslands were once \n"fairyland" (medieval \nNorse Faeroisland) \nbecause the original \nexplorers reached \nthem by sailing west \nand believed them to \nbe the islands of the \ndead. 8 \n\n\n\nFairies \n\nPagan gods and goddesses, tribal ancestors, and those who wor- \nshipped them all became "fairies" in the traditions of France, Germany, \nand the British Isles. The Irish still say fairies live in the pagan sidh \n(burial mounds and barrow graves), several hundred of which still stand \nin the Irish countryside. 1 The Welsh knew their ancestors had a \nmatriarchal society. Like the Irish, they called fairies The Mothers, or \nThe Mother\'s Blessing; and fairyland was always the Land of \nWomen. 2 \n\nFairies came out of their fairy hills at Halloween, Celtic folk said, \nbecause the hills themselves were tomb-wombs of rebirth according \nto the ancient belief, and Halloween was only a new name for Samhain, \nwhen the dead returned to earth with the help of the priestesses \nwho, under Christianity, were newly described as witches. 3 Respect for \nthe pagan dead endured to a remarkably late date, even among \nChristians whose church taught them that the old deities were devils. \nCornish miners refused to make the sign of the cross when down in a \nmine, for fear of offending the fairies in their own subterranean territory \nby making a gesture that invoked their enemy. 4 \n\nIn the Book of the Dun Cow, the fairy queen described her realm \nas "the land of the ever-living, a place where there is neither death, \nnor sin, nor transgression. We have continual feasts: we practice every \nbenevolent work without contention. We dwell in a large Shee \n(sidh); and hence we are called the people of the Fairy-Mound." 5 \n\nThe pagan after-world was a golden "dream time" of long ago, \nwhen heroes were deified by sacred marriage with the Goddess. The \nGreat God Lug, father of Ireland\'s dying savior Cu Chulainn, came \n"out of the chambered undergrounds of Tara where dwell the fourth \nrace of gods who settled Ireland. They are the glorious and golden \ngiants, Tuatha De Danann. These people of the goddess Dana first \nused gold and silver in an Age of Bronze. They first cleared the land, \nfirst drained the swamps. They built the great temples of stone like \nthe one they sent to Britain Stonehenge. When conquered, they \nretired to their underground barrows or Sidhe where they still live \ntoday." 6 \n\nFairy mounds were entrances to the pagan paradise, which might \nbe located underground, or under water, or under hills on distant \nislands across the western sea where the sun died. \n\nThe fairy queen was obviously the ancient fertility-mother, like \nDemeter or Ceres. William of Auvergne said in the 1 3th century she \nwas called Abundia, or Dame Abonde: "Abundance." 9 She was also \ncalled Diana, Venus, Hecate, Sybil, or Titania a title of Cretan \nRhea as ruler of the earth-spirits called Titans, predecessors of the \nOlympian gods. (See Titania.) She had all three personae of the \nTriple Goddess, including the death-dealing Crone which is why an \nIrish title Bean-Sidhe, "Woman of the Fairy-Mounds," was corrupt- \ned into banshee, the shrieking demoness whose voice brought death. In \n\n\n\n298 \n\n\n\nthe form of the triple Morrigan, she sang of blood sacrifices related to \nspringtime renewal of vegetation. 10 A variation on her title was the \nnotorious Morgan le Fay or Morgan the Fairy, also known as the \ndeath-goddess, "Morgue la faye." n \n\nThe Romance of Lancelot du Lac spoke of the fairy queen in \nanother incarnation as Lady of the Lake: "The damsel who carried \nLancelot to the lake was a fay, and in those times all those women were \ncalled fays who had to do with enchantments and charms and there \nwere many of them then, principally in Great Britain and knew the \npower and virtues of words, of stones, and of herbs." Their knights \nwere forbidden to speak their names, for fear of betraying them to \nChristian persecutors. 12 \n\nSecrecy attended many aspects of the fairy-religion, for the very \nreason that it was carried on clandestinely under a dominant religious \nsystem that threatened its practitioners with torture and death. One of \nthe charges that sent Joan of Arc to the stake was that she "adored the \nFairies and did them reverence." n \n\nA legend repeated by the gypsies said if a man found the statue of a \nnaked fate (fairy) in the ruins of pagan temples or tombs, he should \nembrace it with love and eject semen on it. Then, like Pygmalion\'s \nGalatea, the fate would come to life in his dreams and tell her lover \nwhere to find buried treasure, and she would become his "fortune." He \nwould be happy with her forevermore, provided he agreed never to \nset foot in a Christian church again as long as he lived. 14 \n\nThis idea of the fairy-fortune might be traced all the way back to \nancient customs of matrilineal inheritance and matrilocal marriage, \ncharacteristic both of Bronze Age myths and of fairy tales. The fairy-tale \nhero rarely brought a bride to his own home; instead, he left home to \nseek his "fortune," which usually turned out to be a foreign princess \nwon by trial and wedded in her own country, which the hero \nafterward helped rule. As in the pre-patriarchal system, a woman was \n:he "fortune" or "fate" of the young man, words which also meant \n\'fairy," through such intermediates as Fata, Fay, Le Fee, or the "fey" \n:>ne. Fairy and Fate were further related through fear and fair: \nnedieval Latin fatare, "to enchant," became French faerox feer. 15 \n\nMany believed fairies lived in the deep woods where their sacred \njroves had been hidden from priestly interference. Romanians still \n.peak of the Fata Padourii, Girl of the Woods, a fairy similar to the Irish \n)anshee. At night she makes eerie sounds that portend death to the \n| learer. 16 In Brittany, where there were many groves dedicated to the \nVIoon-goddess throughout the middle ages, fairies were sometimes \ncalled man-devent, "Moon-goddesses." 17 \n\nIt seems the fairy-religion was practiced secretly through most of \nhe Christian era, especially by women, whose Goddess the patriar- \nchal church kept trying to take away, giving them no substitute but \nMary, who lacked the old Goddess\'s powers. \n\nCertain French leaders of the Old Religion were described as \n\n\n\nFairies \n\n\n\nBook of the Dun \nCow (Lebar-na-Heera), \nso called because the \noriginal manuscript was \nwritten on vellum \nmade from the skin of a \nprized cow: a \ncollection of 11th- \ncentury Irish tales \nand poems, compiled by \nMailmuri Mac \nKelleher. \n\n\n\n299 \n\n\n\nFairies \n\n\n\nTasso\'s list of Fairy- \nladies showed them \nindistinguishable \nfrom either Goddesses \nor witches, for they \nhad names of both, \nincluding the titles of \nFata, Maga, \nIncantatrice, or wise- \nwoman. They were \nOriana, She of the \nMountain; Silvana or \nSilvanella, She of the \nWood; Filidea, She \nWho Loves the \nGoddess; Mirinda, the \nWarrior Woman; \nArgea, called Queen of \nFate; Lucina, called \nthe Lady of the Lake; \nUrganda, called the \nWise One; two Fates or \nFays named \nDragontina and \nMontana, and \nMorgana with her three \n"daughters," the \nMorrigan. 21 \n\n\n\nTorquato Tasso \n\n(1554-1595) Italian poet \nand dramatist, whose \ncheckered career \nincluded periods of \nresidence in courts, \nconvents, and \nprisons. His major work \nwas an epic on the \nconquest of Jerusalem. \n\n\n\nAucassin and \nNicolette French \nmedieval romance \nbased on an Arabian \nlove story. Aucassin \'s \noriginal name was Al- \nKasim. \n\n\n\n"great princesses who, having refused to embrace Christianity . . . \nwere struck by the curse of God. Hence it is that they are said to be ani- \nmated by a violent hatred of [Christian] religion and of the clergy." \nSometimes they were called Korrigen, Korrig, or Korr, perhaps devotees \nof the Virgin Kore. A Breton lay said: "There are nine Korrigen, \nwho dance, with flowers in their hair, and robes of white wool, around \nthe fountain, by the light of the full moon." They seem to have been \nold women who used masks or makeup: "Seen at night, or in the dusk \nof the evening, their beauty is great; but in the daylight their eyes \nappear red, their hair white, and their faces wrinkled; hence they rarely \nlet themselves be seen by day." 18 \n\nAs late as the 17th century it was said there were shrines kept by "a \nthousand old women" who taught the rites of Venus to young \nmaidens, and instructed them in fairy feats like shape-shifting and raising \nstorms. 19 They were known as fatuae or fatidicae, "seeresses," or \nsometimes bonnes HUes, "good girls." 20 \n\nNorwegian, Scottish, and Irish Christians claimed the fairies were \noffspring of the fallen angels. Like the non-fallen angels, they carried \noff souls of the dead. Any who happened to die at twilight, the fairies\' \nhour between day and night, would find themselves in fairyland \nbetween life and death, or between heaven and hell. 22 Such legends \nreflect ancient views of the after-world as without either punishment \nor reward but only a way-station in the karmic cycle, which is why fairies \nwere like the un-dead able to emerge from their tombs at will. As \npsychopomps, they were the same as Valkyries or Hindu apsaras, the \nheavenly nymphs who became penis, "fairies," in Middle-Eastern \ncountries where the Old Religion was also maintained as a sub-current \nin patriarchal culture. \n\nCertainly one of the strongest attractions of the fairy-religion was \nits permissive view of sexuality, typical of ancient matriarchal societ- \nies, living on in contrast to the harsh anti-sexual attitudes of orthodoxy. \nFairyland was the heaven of sexy angels, as opposed to the Christian \nheaven where "bliss" was specifically not sexual, not even in matrimony \n(Matthew 22:30). The fairyland called Torelore in the romance of \nAucassin and Nicolette was a home for lovers, as opposed to the \nChristian heaven of "old priests, and halt old men and maimed." The \nfairy king lay in bed pretending to give birth to a child, in the ancient rite \nof couvade (see Fatherhood); the queen led an army against their \nenemies in a bloodless battle, the combatants pelting each other with \nsymbolic foods such as apples, eggs, and cheeses. The king said, "it is \nnowise our custom to slay each other." 23 (See Paradise.) \n\nToward this paradise the Fairy Queen led her lovers on a "broad, \nbroad road across the lily lea," as Thomas Rhymer\'s ballad said, \nwhich some called the road to heaven, and others the road to hell: a \nprototype of the famous Primrose Path. The Queen herself was \naddressed as Queen of Heaven. 24 Sometimes her earthly angels were \nmore spirit than mortal, like the fairies called Little Wood Women \n\n\n\n300 \n\n\n\n\\{wudu-maer) in Bavaria, to whom dumplings and other foodstuffs were \noffered. 25 Yet most sources admitted that the fairies were real live \n[women. Prior wrote, "In Danish ballads fairies are full grown women \niand not the diminutive beings of our English tales." Said Andrew \nLang, "There seems little in the characteristics of these fairies of \njromance to distinguish them from human beings, except their super- \nnatural knowledge and power. They are . . . usually of ordinary stature, \niindeed not to be recognized as varying from mankind except by their \n[proceedings." 26 In other words, they were women practicing heathen \njrites. \n\n1.

Letting their imaginations soar, martyrologists \naved over her famous physical beauty. 5 Perhaps because of this, she \ncame a popular patroness of romance.

The \nfemale trinity assumed many different guises in western religion: the \nNorns or Weird Sisters of the north (from wyrdf "fate"), the Zorya of \nthe Slavs, the Morrigan of the Irish, the triple Guinevere or triple Brigi \nof the Britons. \n\nIn Greek myth the three Fates were Horae, Graeae, Muses, \nGorgons, Furies, and other trinities as well as the principal trinity of \nMoerae or Fates. Nearly always, they were weavers. In Anglo-Saxon \nliterature, fate is "woven." Latin destino (destiny) means that which \nis woven, or fixed with cords and threads; fate is "bound" to happen, \njust as the spells of fairy-women were "binding." \' \n\nThe Moerae were Clotho the Spinner, Lachesis the Measurer, \nand Atropos the Cutter of life\'s thread. All were aspects of the archaic \nTriple Aphrodite, of whom it was said her real name was Moera, and \nshe was older than Time. 2 Moera was actually a late name for the \nFate-goddess. In the Mycenaean period it meant a landholding, pos- \nsessed by a female property owner according to the old matriarchal \nsystem. Hence, Moera was a lot: later, "allotted Fate." 3 \n\nAphrodite\'s trinity was sometimes divided into three Horae, or \ncelestial nymphs: Eunomia, Dike, and Irene, meaning Order, Desti- \nny, and Peace. These referred to the "ordering" of elements to form tr \nindividual; the destiny established for him by the Mother; and the \n"peace" of dissolution as decreed at the end of life by Aphrodite \nColumba, the Dove of Peace. 4 \n\nIf the weaving Fates could be induced not to cut the thread of life \nat a perilous moment, the individual would be spared; if not, he \nwould die. Magic charms were often based on this notion. A Slavic \ncharm for healing wounds was addressed to the Fate-weaver on the \nmystic isle of Bujan, or Buyan, the Goddess\'s paradise: "In the Ocean- \nsea, on the isle of Buyan, a fair maiden was weaving silk; she did not \nleave off weaving silk; the blood ceased flowing." 5 According to RussU \nmyth, this maiden was the Virgin of Dawn, equivalent to the Latin \nMater Matuta, or the Greek Eos, traditionally the first Fate. The sun \ngod went to rest on her magic isle, and rose again from it each day. 6 \n\nOther Greek names for the Fate-goddess were Tyche, Dike, and \n\n\n\n302 \n\n\n\nNemesis. Romans called her Fortuna; a trinity or a monad. A \nterracotta medallion from Vienne showed her as a tutelary city-goddess, \nwearing a mural crown, enthroned in a laurel wreath. 7 As the \nBabylonian "Mother of Destiny," Fate was named Mammetun, the \nCreatress. 8 All were based on the primordial Indo-European Mother \nof Karma, i.e., Kali Ma. \n\n"Fate" was synonymous with "fairy" in the Middle Ages. Alphon- \nsus de Spina placed "Fates" first on his list of devils, remarking: \n"Some say they have seen Fates, but if so they are not women but \ndemons." 9 Burchardus of Worms complained that the people hon- \nored the Fates or Weird Sisters at the beginning of every year, putting \nofferings of food and drink on a table for them, with three knives for \ncutting their meat presumably so the death-dealing Cutter wouldn\'t \nbe tempted to use her own knife. 10 \n\nGreeks still say the Fates visit the cradle of every newborn, to \ndetermine the child\'s future as his fairy godmothers. Parents used to \nchain up the watchdog, leave the door open, and set out dainty foods to \nput the Moerae in a good humor. 11 Many fairy tales give stern lessons \nin the folly of offending fairy godmothers. Gypsies still say "three ladies \nin white" stand at the cradle of each child, and take back the soul \nwhen life has run its course, like the Three Queens of Arthurian legend. \nGreek laments for the dead are still called moirologhia, giving the \ndeceased back to the Moerae. 12 \n\nI.

Ancestral mothers had been deified by their descen- \ndants for countless generations. Patriarchs craved similar nations of \ndescendants, for a tribal ancestor achieved great glory in the after- \nworld. Men transferred their allegiance from the Great Mother, the \noriginal deified ancestress, to gods like Yahweh, on the basis of his \npromises: "I will make of these a great nation, and I will bless thee, and \n\nmake thy name great I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I \n\nwill make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee" (Genesis \n12, 17). \n\nPersians said a man who died childless couldn\'t enter paradise at \nall. Prayers and sacrifices of descendants were essential to blessedness \nfor the paternal soul. Hindus defined a son as one whose incantations \nand offerings kept a father\'s spirit from wandering homeless and \nhungry in the waste spaces of eternity. The Brhaddarma Purana said, \n"No rituals are performed for the man who has no descendants \n\n\n\nPuranas are ancient \nSanskrit scriptures in \nverse, treating of cos- \nmologies, sacred \nhistories, and the na- \nture of the divine. \n\n\n\n303 \n\n\n\nFatherhood Sons are useful to give oblations to the ancestors." \' The Chinese \n\nthought if a man had no son, he cut the continuous line of paternal \n\n^ h^mm ancestor-worship and lost his chance of becoming immortal. 2 \n\nFatherhood was largely a ceremonial relationship, with little recog- \nnition that men might take an active part in raising their own \nchildren. The classical Latin term paterfamilias, now connoting a father- \nof-a-family and household ruler, didn\'t convey anything like that to \nthe Romans who invented the term: \n\nWhen the ancients invoked Jupiter under that title of pater of gods and \nmen, they did not mean that he was their physical father, for they never \nsupposed he was, but on the contrary believed that the human race had \nexisted before he did. The same title was given to Neptune, Apollo, \nBacchus, Vulcan and Pluto, whom men certainly did not suppose to be \ntheir fathers. . . . Similarly, in legal language, the title o/paterfamilias \ncould be given to a man who had no children, was not married, was not \neven old enough to enter upon a marriage . . . ; pater, the Latin word \ncognate to "father" and closest akin to it in meaning, signifies not so much \nhim who has begotten a younger person as him who has natural \nauthority over one inferior in age or status. J \n\nMen or gods began to claim physical fatherhood not so much by \nan act of begetting, as by a different, ceremonial act designed to imitate \nthe motherly act of birth-giving. (See Birth-giving, Male.) In earliest \ntimes the imitation was quite literal, like the rite of couvade practiced by \nprimitives to establish paternal rights to a child. While the mother \ngave birth, the father took to his bed moaning and groaning, and \npretended to bring forth the child. Couvade was an initiation ritual \nfor priests of Aphrodite Ariadne at Amathus, where a man dressed in \nfemale clothing went through a pantomime of childbirth, to earn the \npriestly title of "father." 4 \n\nChristian writers said their religion was sent to convert Europe to a \npatriarchal system in which men could demand respect from their \noffspring. Before Christianity came to Britain, there was a "great sin" in \nthe structure of the clans: "the father loved not the son, nor the son \nloved not the father." 5 Early missionaries complained that British tribes \npaid no attention to the matter of who begot whom; women took \nlovers as they pleased, and "marital vows are never observed." St. Boni- \nface said the English "utterly despise legitimate matrimony," mean- \ning the kind of matrimony that gave husbands control of property and \nchildren. 6 \n\nEventually, Christianity changed the pagans\' casual attitude \ntoward fatherhood. St. Thomas Aquinas laid down the church\'s \nofficial opinion that a father is the true parent, a mother only the "soil" \nin which the father\'s "seed" grows. He said a father should be more \nloved than a mother, because the father\'s part in giving life to the child \nis "active," whereas the mother\'s part is only "passive." 7 \n\nEmphasis on paternity was characteristic of patriarchal societies, \nwhere men often tried to pretend that begetting a child was more \n\n\n\n304 \n\n\n\nimportant than the mother\'s multi-faceted task of carrying, delivering, \nnursing, and teaching it all the basic skills of living. In matriarchal \nArabia, biological paternity meant nothing. After the coming of Islam, \nmen considered paternity so important that they instituted a year\'s \nwaiting period between a woman\'s divorce or widowhood and her \nremarriage, to make absolutely sure she was not pregnant by the \nprevious husband, since no man wanted his wife giving birth to another \nman\'s child. 8 The same waiting period was demanded in Christian \nEurope, and became so taken for granted that it became "indecent" for \na woman to remarry too soon after an earlier husband\'s departure or \ndeath. \n\nOne reason for the restrictive, authoritarian atmosphere of patriar- \nchal societies seems to have been that men didn\'t readily see their \nchildren as separate persons, but viewed them as extensions of the \nfather\'s own ego, therefore requiring strict discipline to make them \nconform to the pattern. Zimmer says in the language of symbols, son \nmeans "double," "alter ego," "living copy of the father," "the \nfather\'s essence in another individualization." 9 Thus the father\'s inter- \nest in children was more selfish than the mother\'s. \n\nHarriet Stanton Blatch wrote, "Men talk of the sacredness of \nmotherhood, but judging from their acts it is the last thing that is held \nsacred. . . . The sense of obligation to offspring, men possess but feebly; \nthere has not been developed by animal evolution an instinct of \npaternity. They are not disinherited fathers; they are simply unevolved \nparents. Those who could improve humanity have been hindered by \nthose who prefer to improve steam engines. . . . The sex which has been \nlaboriously evolved by nature for the arduous work of race-building is \nhandicapped." Western patriarchy developed a culture of acquisitive- \nness, aggression, and hierarchy for the very reason that its underlying \nphilosophy was masculine-selfish, according to Neumann: "This situa- \ntion of the patriarchate known to us particularly from its Western \n[development is characterized by a recession of feminine psychology \nand its dominants; now feminine existence is almost entirely deter- \nI mined by the masculine world of consciousness and its values." 10 \n\nThe masculine world of consciousness has been characterized as \n"barren" and "destructive," insofar as "the fantasies of the single man \npervade our popular culture." n These focus on self-centered greed, \naggression, or defensiveness on behalf of the self, with little compre- \nhension of love, dependence, or responsibility toward future \ngenerations. Behavior patterns of the masculine world remind one \nthat the earliest Chinese ideograph for "male" was also a synonym for \n"selfish." 12 \n\nThis culture passes harsh judgment on women who are labeled \nunfit mothers, because males however "dominant" identify with the \nchild, not the mother. Standards for fathers are not so high. Drunkards, \nadulterers, child-beaters, even criminals are supposed to have a \n"right" to fatherhood, to say nothing of millions of men who treat their \n\n\n\nFatherhood \n\n\n\nHarriet Stanton \nBlatch 20th-century \nAmerican feminist, \ndaughter of Elizabeth \nCady Stanton. \n\n\n\n305 \n\n\n\nFatima children with a neglectful indifference that would bring down soci- \n\nFebronia, Saint e ty\'s wrath on a female parent.

The story probably was intended to express hostility to a \nveil-known Goddess-symbol. The fig was always female, its heart- \nshaped leaves representing "the conventional form of the yoni." 1 \n\n\n\n307 \n\n\n\nFig \n\n\n\nZekerboni \n\nA treatise on \noneiromancy (dream \ninterpretation) by \nPierre Mora, \nmanuscript #2790 in \nthe Bibliotheque de \nl\'Arsenal. \n\n\n\nRomans used to celebrate "a rude and curious rite" in connection with \nthe fertilization of Juno Caprotina, Goddess of the Fig Tree, by her \nlecherous horned goat god. 2 \n\nJesus\'s rival deity Mithra, whom some called the true Messiah, \nalso was involved with the maternal fig tree. Shortly after his birth \nfrom the petra genetrix, and his discovery by adoring shepherds, Mithra \nwas adopted by the fig tree, which provided him with a continuous \nsupply of food (fruit) and clothing (leaves). 3 According to the Book of \nGenesis, fig leaves were the world\'s first clothing, donned by Adam \nand Eve as soon as they acquired knowledge. Adoption by a fig tree also \nfigured prominently in the legend of Buddha, protected by the Bodhi \nTree, or Tree of Wisdom, Ecus religiosa, the Holy Fig, when he \nreceived his enlightenment on Full Moon Day in the month of \nMay. 4 \n\nThe fig was a common Indo-Iranian symbol of the Great Mother. \nBabylonian Ishtar also took the form of the divine fig tree Xikum, the \n"primeval mother at the central place of the earth," protectress of the \nsavior Tammuz. 5 Patriachal writers of the Koran later turned Ishtar\'s \ntree to Zakkum, the Tree of Hell, growing downward from the earth\'s \nunderside. 6 \n\nGaulish gods called Dusii were described in medieval Latin as \nficarii, "fig-eaters," which meant the same as the Homeric "lotus- \neaters," in view of the fact that both the fig and the lotus symbolized \nfemale genitals. 7 Anglo-Saxon "fuck" may have been derived from \nReus, "fig." To this day, Italians make the mano in fica, "fig-hand," as a \nderogatory sexual sign implying, like the raised middle finger, "fuck \nyou." The mano in fica was of Oriental origin, a lingam-yoni formed by \nthe thumb projecting between two fingers. Hindus called the fig- \nhand a sacred mudra, and Ovid said Roman householders used it as a \nprotection against evil spells. 8 To Christians however, it was manus \nobscenus, "the obscene hand." 9 \n\nLike other genital symbols, the fig was often incorporated into love \ncharms together with many other items formerly sacred to Venus. \nSome of these items blood, bread, doves, and pentacles joined the \nfig in a charm from the Zekerboni, to make bachelors see their future \nbrides in a dream: \n\nThey must have powdered coral and some fine powdered lodestone, \nwhich they shall mix together and dilute with the blood of a white \npigeon, and they shall make a dough of it, which they shall enclose in a \nlarge fig after having wrapped it in blue taffeta; they shall hang this \nround their neck, and when they go to bed shall put the pentacle for \nSaturday under their bolster, saying a special prayer the while. w \n\n\n\n1.

Middle finger, index finger, and \nthumb invoked pagan trinities of Father-Mother-Son, such as Jupiter- \n[uno-Mars, or Osiris-Isis-Horus. The same kind of trinity, consisting \njf God, Mary, and Jesus, used to be worshipped by eastern Christians \nwhich may explain why Christianity adopted the mano pantea and \nrenamed it "the hand of blessing." 3 The gesture was displayed by \n\nhristian priests and by emperors or kings by way of benediction and \nexpression of their own union with the land. 4 \n\nThe thumb was the child, or child-soul symbolized in such fables \nis Hop-O-My-Thumb. The index finger was the Mother, the one \nwho pointed, controlled, cast spells. The middle finger was the Father, a \nphallic symbol for thousands of years, up to and including the present \nday. \n\nArabs used to cut open a vein of the middle finger with a stone \ncnife when making a pledge of faith, invoking a curse of castration if \n:he pledge be broken. 5 Roman male prostitutes used to signal potential \n:ustomers by thrusting the middle finger into the hair of their heads. 6 \nLike all widely recognized phallic symbols, the middle finger was \nassociated with the devil by Christian authorities, who referred to it as \ndigitus infamis, "the vile finger." When the torturers asked accused \nbitches which finger they raised to take the devil\'s oath, the only \n\'right" answer they would accept was the middle finger. 7 It was \n:onsidered evil to wear a ring on the middle finger, for reasons plainly \nassociated with its sexual meanings. 8 \n\nOddly enough, the classic finger-sign of the devil didn\'t use the \nniddle finger at all, but displayed his "horned head" by pinning \ndown the middle and fourth fingers with the thumb and extending the \nndex and little fingers. On the well-known magic principle that an \nsvil sign was prophylactic against evil, this gesture was often used in \nItaly and the Balkans as a defense against the evil eye. Like most \nEuropean symbols, it seems to have originated with Kali Ma, who \njhowed it as a mudra (sacred gesture) in her manifestation as \n[agadamba, "Mother of the World." 9 Probably it was meant to signify \ntier own horned head embodied in the sacred cow. \n\nThe most revered mudra was the one meaning "infinity" or \n\'perfection," and most generally associated with female genitalia: \nthumb and forefinger pressed together at the tips, the other three fingers \n\n\n\n309 \n\n\n\nFirmament extended our modern OK sign. 10 Tantric yogis and bodhisattvas \n\nmade this gesture in token of contemplative ecstasy. 11 Persian sacred \n\n^^^^^^^ amulets of the Sassanian period (3rd century B.C.) showed a hand in \n\nthis position, flanked by horns of fertility. 12 The joined thumb and index \nfinger formed a vesica piscis, immemorial symbol of the yoni, while \nthe three extended fingers perhaps referred to the Goddess\'s trinity. \nWestern Europe inherited the Egyptian idea that the index and \nmiddle fingers stood for the mother and father, respectively. Egyptian \nmummies were buried with a protective amulet invoking both parents, \ncalled the Amulet of the Two Fingers. 15 The index or "mother" \nfinger was the most magical. This was the finger that guided, showed, \nbeckoned, called for attention, blessed, and cursed. \n\nMedieval Christians feared the pointing of a witch\'s index finger, \nwhich is why children are still taught that it\'s rude to point, and why a \nwoman\'s characteristic scolding gesture brandishes the index finger like \na weapon. In Tantric tradition, this mother-finger was known as "the \nthreatening finger." 14 All Indo-European traditions knew it was female. \nArabs said the index finger represents the Goddess Fatima, whose \nsymbolic Hand is still revered as a mystic summary of "the whole \nreligion of Islam." 15 \n\nJewish patriarchs insisted on fettering a woman\'s threatening, spell- \ncasting right index finger with the wedding ring, and orthodox Jewish \nwomen wear a wedding ring on that finger to this day. Christians, \nhowever, copied their wedding-ring custom from the pagans, who \nsaid a mystic "love vein" ran directly from the fourth finger of the left \nhand to the heart, therefore this finger should be bound in marriage. \nMacrobius wrote that a woman\'s wedding ring should be placed on that \nfinger "to prevent the sentiments of the heart from escaping." 16 \n\nThere was a universal prejudice against cutting fingernails without \ncareful disposal, lest fingernail pairings be used in malignant spells \nagainst their former owner. Norse myth said the doomsday ship Naglfar \nwas made of dead men\'s fingernails, so "if a man dies with his nails \nunshorn he is adding greatly to the materials for Naglfar" and bringing \ndoomsday that much closer. 17 Hence the custom of manicuring \ncorpses. \n\n1.

Branston, 278. \n\n\n\nFirmament \n\nThe Hebrew word for firmament meant "a sheet of hammered \nmetal." Sometimes this was called "the heaven of brass." The Bible \ngives the ancient notion that the heaven was the bottom of a vast \n\n\n\n310 \n\n\n\npistern, holding "the waters which were above the firmament" (Gene- Firstborn \n\nis 1:7) i.e., rain. \n\nAccording to this primitive notion, the rain fell down when angels ^^m^^m^mi^^ \nppened the "windows of heaven" to let some of the water out of the \nenormous cistern. Canaanite and early Jewish temples had magic \nb/indows in the roof, supposed to be models of the celestial windows, \nince everything about a temple was meant to copy the cosmos, not only \nymbolically but literally. When rain was needed, the magic windows \nivere opened, and this was believed to cause a corresponding action in \nhe celestial region. 2 This is why the Bible says God sent Noah\'s \nflood by opening all the windows of heaven at once (Genesis 7:1 1). \n\nThe biblical firmament of brass was based on an ancient Oriental \nmage of the house of Varuna, located in the zenith. It was a "house \nbf many mansions," corresponding to Jesus\'s description of his father\'s \nheaven (John 14:2). It had a thousand doors through which the light \nbf the celestial regions could shine, forming the stars. 5 These were \niransmuted by biblical writers into the windows of heaven. \n\n1. Gaster, 6. 2. Larousse, 79. 3. Campbell, Or.M., 177. \n\n\n\nFirstborn \n\nliost Asiatic gods claimed the title of Firstborn of the Womb, in \nanskrit Hiranyagarbha. Each priesthood wanted its own god to be \nfirstborn" of the Creatress, because her eldest child would wield \natural authority over the others. Since it was impossible for more than \nne god to be the Firstborn, scholars simply used the title and \nllaimed each god was the firstborn of one of the Great Mother\'s virgin \nmanations. \n\nThe classic example was the Buddha, born in many incarnations, \nach time as a "firstborn" of the Goddess\'s earthly representative, a \npmple maiden or devadasi, "Virgin Bride of God," bearing the name \nand spirit) of Maya, the virgin aspect of Mother Kali. As in all myths \nf divine births, the maiden might have an earthly husband, but he \nkln\'t lie with her until after she brought forth her firstborn child, \n|ho was the son of God, or, in Buddha\'s case, the son of Ganesha, the \nLord of Hosts. 1 \n\nThe actual mechanism of these divine impregnations was quite \nleral. The virgin mother-to-be deflowered herself by straddling the \nicred lingam the god\'s erect penis and allowing it to penetrate her. 2 \ni /hile thus conceiving the god\'s son, the virgin placed a wreath of \nowers on the head of his image, a symbolic act reminiscent of the \nticient Indian svayamara ceremony. 3 The wreath was her own \npnital symbol; the god\'s "head" was his. The god\'s head and the head \nThis lingam were both anointed with holy oil for the sacred \nliarriage, certainly a logical necessity for inserting a stone shaft into a \nagina. The custom and the temple phalli were standard \n\n\n\nI \n\n\n\n311 \n\n\n\nFirstborn throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean world, where the \n\nholy oil was known as chrism, and the priapic god was therefore a \n,^ ^^ m wm Christos or "Anointed One." \n\nIn the Middle East, Maya became Maia, Mari, or Mary, another \n"virgin bride of God" who served as a temple maiden or kadesha, the \nequivalent of the Hindu devadasi. According to the classic Indo- \nEuropean pattern, the angel of the Lord "came in unto" Mary (Luke \n1:28), which was the biblical term for sexual intercourse; and her \nhusband Joseph "knew her not until she had brought forth her \nfirstborn son" (Matthew 1:25). \n\nDivinely begotten firstborn children were sacer singled out for a \nspecial fate from the earliest times, when first fruits of all kinds were \noffered to the same deities supposed to have given them. Firstborn sons \nembodied the god, became the god, and were offered to the god. A \nmass sacrifice of firstborn sons in Egypt, to appease the deities during a \nsevere drought, was recorded in the Old Testament by Jewish scribes \nwho revised the legend to claim their own Yahweh was responsible for \nkilling the Egyptian children (Exodus 12:29). \n\nActually, Egyptian firstborn-sacrifice came from very ancient tradi- \ntions. The Book of the Dead said, "On the day of hacking in pieces \nthe firstborn ... the mighty ones in heaven light the fire under the \ncauldrons where are heaped up the thighs of the firstborn." 4 Under \nthe later dynasties these may have been animal sacrifices, but the \nhieroglyphic sign of the "thighs" showed human legs, not animal \nlegs. The Bible says Yahweh copied the act of Egypt\'s "mighty ones in \nheaven," and sent out fire to consume the sons of Aaron on the altar \n(Leviticus 10:2). \n\nLike an Egyptian god, Yahweh told his priests: "Sanctify unto me \nall the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children \nof Israel, both of man and of beast; it is mine" (Exodus 13:2). Firstborn \nchildren were offered on Yahweh\'s altars until priests began to permit \nredemption of the child by offering a lamb instead (Exodus 13:1 5). \nThus the paschal lamb of the Passover legend was really a substitute \nfor the son, just as the ram who replaced Isaac on Yahweh\'s altar also \nrepresented a transition from human to animal sacrifice (Genesis \n22:9-13). The story of Isaac and the ram probably was copied from the \nBoeotian myth of the king\'s firstborn son Phrixus, who was to be \nsacrificed on the altar, when the ram of the Golden Fleece miraculoush \nappeared as a substitute victim. 5 \n\nYahweh\'s acceptance of an animal sacrifice in place of a human \none didn\'t necessarily mean he was more humane than contemporary \ngods elsewhere. Long before the period allotted to Abraham, Oriental \nnations had been offering animals instead of human victims. 6 Indeed, \nthe Jews seem to have clung to the older custom for a longer time than \nmost of their contemporaries. They ignored Hadrian\'s prohibition of \nhuman sacrifice, and continued in secret to sustain their god on humam \nblood, as in the rites of the Essenic Christos. 7 See Virgin Birth. \n\n\n\n312 \n\n\n\nRomans may have given up human sacrifice, but they had not \nriven up the ceremony of firstborn-conception. Roman brides rou- \ntinely deflowered themselves on the carved phalli of Hermes, Tutunus, \nj-\'riapus, or some other "anointed" god before lying with their \nbridegrooms, so their firstborn children would be god-begotten. 8 It was \ntommon everywhere to refer to firstborn children as "born by the \ntrace of God." 9 \n\nFathers of the Christian church deplored the custom, because it \n|nade an everyday event of the birth of a Christos which they \n[referred to consider miraculous. St. Augustine denounced Roman \nlomen for encouraging young brides to "come and sit on the \nriasculine monstrosity representing Priapus." The women, he said, \nriewed this custom as "very honest and religious." 10 Lactantius \njxplained that the idea of the ceremony was to render the bride fruitful \nby her communion with the divine nature." u \n\nAfter the "divine nature" of these priapic gods was declared a \nlevilish nature, yet the ceremony may have persisted, as indicated by \nhedieval witches\' description of intercourse with the devil. They \nlaimed his penis was hard and cold, and his body was "cold all over, \nIke a creature of stone." 12 Such a "devil" could well have been a \nfeature of stone in fact that is, a statue of Priapus or one of the \nllther phallic gods, believed to beget Antichrist in the classical manner, \nb the firstborn of a virgin mother. \n\n1.

It was associated \ndth the "Fishy Smell" that Hindus made a title of the yonic Goddess \nerself, because they said women\'s genitals smelled like fish. 1 The \nChinese Great Mother Kwan-yin ("Yoni of yonis") often appeared \ns a fish-goddess. 2 As the swallower of Shiva\'s penis, Kali became \nlinaksi the "fish-eyed" one, just as in Egypt, Isis the swallower of \n)siris\'s penis became Abtu, the Great Fish of the Abyss. 3 \n\nFish and womb were synonymous in Greek; delphos meant both. 4 \nTie original Delphic oracle first belonged to the abyssal fish-goddess \nnder her pre-Hellenic name of Themis, often incarnate in a great fish, \nhale, or dolphin (delphinos). The cycles in which she devoured and \nKurrected the Father-Son entered all systems of symbolism from the \nIjws\' legend of Jonah to the classic "Boy on the Dolphin." Apuleius \nm the Goddess playing the part of the Dolphin was Aphrodite Salacia, \nwith fish-teeming womb." 5 \n\nHer "boy" was Palaemon, the reincarnated young sun, made new \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVesica piscis \n\n\n\n313 \n\n\n\nFlidhais after sinking into the same abyssal womb as the dying god Heracles. 6 \n\nThe fish-goddess Aphrodite Salacia was said to bring "salacity" through \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ orgiastic fish-eating on her sacred day, Friday. The Catholic church \n\ninherited the pagan custom of Friday fish-eating and pretended it was a \nholy fast; but the disguise was thin. Friday was dies veneris in Latin, \nthe Day of Venus, or of lovemaking: Freya\'s Day in Teutonic Europe. \nThe notion that fish are "aphrodisiac" food is still widespread even \ntoday. \n\nThe Celts thought fish-eating could place new life in a mother\'s 1 \nwomb. Their hero Tuan was eaten in fish form by the Queen of \nIreland, who thus re-conceived him and gave him a new birth. 7 In \nanother myth, fish were associated with the clots of "wise blood" \nemanating from the Mother-tree with its sacred fountain, in Fairyland. 8 \nThey were called blood-red nuts of the Goddess Boann, eaten by \n"salmon of knowledge" who swam in her sacred fountain. "Poets and \nstory-tellers, speaking of any subject difficult to deal with, often say, \n\'Unless I had eaten the salmon of knowledge I could not describe it."" \nThe fish symbol of the yonic Goddess was so revered throughout \nthe Roman empire that Christian authorities insisted on taking it \nover, with extensive revision of myths to deny its earlier female-genital \nmeanings. Some claimed the fish represented Christ because Greek \nichthys, "fish," was an acronym for "Jesus Christ, Son of God." But the \nChristian fish-sign was the same as that of the Goddess\'s yoni or \nPearly Gate: two crescent moons forming a vesica piscis. Sometimes the \nChrist child was portrayed inside the vesica, which was superimposed \n\nFish on Mary\'s belly and obviously represented her womb, just as in the \n\nancient symbolism of the Goddess. \n\nA medieval hymn called Jesus "the Little Fish which the Virgin \ncaught in the Fountain." ,0 Mary was equated with the virgin \nAphrodite-Mari, or Marina, who brought forth all the fish in the sea. Or \nthe Cyprian site of Aphrodite\'s greatest temple, Mary is still wor- \nshipped as Panaghia Aphroditessa. 11 In biblical terms, "Jesus son of \nMaria" meant the same as Yeshua son of Marah, or Joshua son of \nNun (Exodus 33:1 1), which also means son of the Fish-mother. Mary\'s \nmany Mesopotamian names like Mari, Marriti, Nar-Marratu, Mara, j \nwere written like the Hebrew Mem with an ideogram meaning both \n"sea" and "mother." 12 The next letter in the Hebrew sacred alpha- \nbet was Nun, "fish." \n\nAnother biblical name for the Goddess was Mehitabel, none other \nthan the Egyptian Fish-mother Mehit in a Hebrew disguise. 15 \n\n1.

Thousands of \nyears before the Bible was written, an ark was built by Sumerian \nZiusudra. In Akkad, the flood hero\'s name was Atrakhasis. In Babylon \nhe was Uta-Napishtim, the only mortal to become immortal. In \nGreece he was Deucalion, who repopulated the earth after the waters \nsubsided, with the help of his wife Pyrrha and the advice of the Great \nGoddess of the waters, Themis. In Armenia, the hero was Xisuthros a \ncorruption of Sumerian Ziusudra whose ark landed on Mount \nArarat. 1 \n\nAccording to the original Chaldean account, the flood hero was \ntold by his god, "Build a vessel and finish it. By a deluge I will destroy \nsubstance and life. Cause thou to go up into the vessel the substance of \nall that has life." Technical instructions followed: the ark was to be \n600 cubits long by 60 wide, with three times 3600 measures of asphalt \non its exterior and the same amount inside. Three times 3600 porters \nbrought chests of provisions, of which 3600 chests were for the hero\'s \nimmediate family, while "the mariners divided among themselves \ntwice three thousand six hundred chests." 2 It seems that Noah\'s ark was \nmuch smaller than earlier heroic proportions. \n\nAs long ago as 1872, George Smith translated the Twelve Tablets \nof Creation from Ashurbanipal\'s library, and discovered the earlier \nversion of the flood myth. 5 Among the details that religious orthodoxy \ntook care to suppress was the point that the god who caused the flood \nwas disobedient to the Great Mother, who didn\'t want her earthly \nchildren drowned. Mother Ishtar severely punished the disobedient \ngod by cursing him with her "great lightnings." She set her magic \nrainbow in the heavens to block his access to offerings on earthly \naltars, "since rashly he caused the flood-storm, and handed over my \npeople to destruction." 4 \n\nOld Testament writers copied other details of the ancient flood \nmyth but could not allow their god to be punished by the Great \nWhore of Babylon, as if he were a naughty child sent to bed without \nsupper by an angry mother. Thus, they transformed Ishtar\'s rainbow \nbarrier into a "sign of the covenant" voluntarily set in the heavens by \nGod himself (Genesis 9:13). \n\nThe Tigris-Euphrates valley was subject to disastrous floods. One \nespecially was long remembered; geologists have linked it with the \nvolcanic cataclysm that blew apart the island of Thera (Santorin) and \ndestroyed Cretan civilization. When Sir Leonard Woolley was \n\n\n\nCubit From Latin \ncubitum, "elbow"; the \nlength of an average \nhand and forearm from \nthe tip of the middle \nfinger to the elbow \n(about 18-21 \ninches). \n\nAshurbanipai King \nof Assyria ca. 669-630 \nB.C., military leader \nand statesman. He \ncollected at Nineveh \na large library of \ncuneiform texts, \nrediscovered by \narcheologists in the \n19th century a.d. \n\n\n\n315 \n\n\n\nFlora \nFly \n\n\n\nexcavating the site of Ur, he found the track of a mighty flood a layer \nof clay without artifacts, eight feet thick. 5 Such a flood may have been \nidentified with the watery Chaos that all Indo-European peoples be- \nlieved would swallow up the world at the end of its cycle, and out of \nwhich a new world would be reborn in the womb of the Formless \nMother. 6 The ark and its freight represented seeds of life passing \nthrough the period of Chaos from the destruction of one universe to the \nbirth of the next. Even in the Bible, the "birth" was heralded by the \nGoddess\'s yonic dove (Genesis 8:12). \n\nGnostic literature preserved the older view of the flood-causing \nGod as an evil destroyer of humanity, and the Goddess as its \npreserver. Because people refused to worship him alone, jealous Jeho- \nvah sent the flood to wipe out all life. Fortunately the Goddess \nopposed him, "and Noah and his family were saved in the ark by means \nof the sprinkling of light that proceeded from her, and through it the \nworld was again filled with humankind." 7 \n\nThis Gnostic interpretation had both Babylonian and Hellenic \nroots. Greeks said the primal sea-mother Themis gave Deucalion and \nhis wife occult knowledge ("light") of how to create human beings from \nstones, "the bones of their Mother," i.e., of the earth. 8 Raising up \nliving people from stones or bones was a popular miracle. Jesus \nmentioned it, and Ezekiel\'s God claimed to have done it in the valley \nof bones (Ezekiel 37). \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1, 142; Hooke, M.E.M., 130. 2. Lethaby, 239. 3. Ceram, 314. \n4.

She rubbed her body \nwith an ointment, then lay down in a kneading-trough and passed into a \nstate of delirium, thrashing about, and muttering of Venus and the \ndevil. When she returned to her senses, the friars told her she had been \nto a meeting of devils and witches. On another occasion, Pope Julius \nIll\'s chief astrologer experimentally rubbed a woman\'s body with witch- \nsalve composed of hemlock, mandrake, henbane, and belladonna. \nShe went into a coma lasting 36 hours and experienced many \nhallucinations. 2 \n\nProfessor H. S. Clarke recently noted that many drugs used by \nwitches were known to cause such effects. Aconite disturbs the \nheartbeat and produces peculiar sensations, including dizziness or a \nsensation of flying. Belladonna produces delirium. Hemlock causes \nexcitement and later paralysis. "Rubbing such ointments into the skin \nwould intensify any physiological properties." These drugs, not the \nfat of boiled children that churchmen deemed essential, made the \n"magic" of witches\' flying ointment. 3 \n\nOil was the vehicle for a flying ointment of Roman witches, \naccording to Lucian, who described a woman transforming herself \ninto a night-raven by rubbing her body with holy oil, then flying away \nthrough the window. 4 The flying journey to heaven was the primary \ncomponent of any magical initiation; it could be induced by ointment, \nor by eating the body of a god. By eating the flesh of Osiris in the \nform of bread, an initiate could become an Osiris and ascend to heaven, \nand "in one little moment pass over limitless distances which would \nneed millions and hundreds of thousands of years for a man to pass \n\n\n\nover. \n\n\n\nThough ascent to heaven via a god\'s eaten body was certainly a \ncentral Christian doctrine, the church declared it a sin to believe it \ncould be done by the living, with the help of a non-Christian deity. Up \nto the middle of the medieval period, the church said the flights of \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor H. S. \nClarke Author of an \nappendix to \nMargaret Murray\'s \nWitch Cult in \nWestern Europe, 1 92 1 . \n\n\n\n317 \n\n\n\nFocus witches were wholly imaginary, and it was heresy to believe them real. \n\nFootbinding After the Inquisition took shape, the church said the flights of witches \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ were real, and it was heresy to believe them imaginary. \n\nThe earlier opinion appeared in the Canon Episcopi, written by a \nsecretary of the Archbishop of Trier about 900 a.d., though it was \npassed off as a canon of the 4th-century Council of Ancyra; its \nfraudulence was demonstrated centuries later. It told Christians to \nreject the "demonic illusions" that made women think they flew \nthrough the night air with the pagan Goddess Diana. 6 When the \nchurch\'s opinion was reversed in the 1 3th century, those who doubted \nthe witches\' flights were said to "sin in the lack of true reverence to \nour mother the church." 7 \n\nSupported by plenty of "evidence" from the torture chamber, the \nuseful theory of witches\' flights could account for the fact that no one \never saw the vast assemblages, allegedly coming together from great \ndistances, to the devilish sabbat. 8 It could also account for the prison \nsuicides of victims who beat their heads against their cell walls until they \ndied, to avoid further torture. The inquisitor Bodin said witches left \nunbound between sessions in the torture chamber often dashed them- \nselves against the wall and broke their necks because they tried to fly \naway with Diana or Minerva. 9 \n\nMany women confessed under torture that they dug up children\'s \ncorpses to make their flying ointment. On one occasion at Lindheim, \nsix women confessed to this crime and were sentenced to the stake. The \nfamily of one of the women instituted an investigation of the grave in \nquestion, where the child\'s body was discovered intact. The inquisitors \nsmoothly explained that the devil had reassembled the body to cause \nconfusion. The witches were burned on schedule. 10 \n\n1. Kramer & Sprenger, 104. 2. Castiglioni, 249-50. 3.

Many women died of suppuration and \ngangrene before the desired effect was complete. \n\nChinese men were conditioned to intense fetishistic passion for \ndeformed female feet. Chinese poets sang ecstatic praises of the lotus \nfeet that aroused their desire to fever pitch. The crippled woman was \nconsidered immeasurably charming by reason of her vulnerability, \nher suffering, and her helplessness she couldn\'t even escape an \nattacker by running away. 1 \n\nWesterners sometimes imagined that footbinding produced a well- \nshaped but miniaturized foot. Actually, it bore little resemblance to a \nnormal foot. The four smaller toes were folded completely under the \nsole; then the whole foot was folded so the underside of the heel and \ntoes were brought together. The victim had to keep her feet tightly \nbandaged forever; letting them spread again would cause even worse \npain. \n\n1 . See Levy. \n\n\n\nForgery \n\n\n\nForgery \n\nDocumentary foundations of the Christian church\'s temporal powers \nwere often forged, including the crucial Petrine doctrine of the keys (see \nPeter, Saint). Notable among later forgeries were the Decretals of \nSt. Isidore, alleged canons and decrees of the papacy from apostolic \ntimes to the 8th century a.d., upholding papal claims to authority \nover European nations. These documents were first composed in \nFrance about the year 850 a.d., though they pretended to date from \nthe earliest foundations of the church. \n\nCardinal Nicholas of Cusa patiently investigated the Decretals in \nthe 1 5 th century and found them to be clumsy forgeries full of \nanachronisms and garbled history. 1 The church refused to acknowledge \nthat its traditional privileges were founded on false documents. The \nworks of subsequent scholars revealing the deception were banned and \ntheir authors persecuted. Apologists who tried to explain away the \nforgery were rewarded with ecclesiastical preferments. In 1628, when \nBlondel published irrefutable proof of the Decretals\' fraudulence, his \nwork was promptly placed on the Index of Prohibited Books. \n\nAmong the False Decretals was the so-called Donation of Con- \nstantine, whereby Pope Sylvester I and his successors were granted \ntemporal as well as spiritual dominion over the entire empire, and the \nfiefdoms of the Papal States were established. According to this \ndocument, Constantine made the pope the greatest feudal lord in Italy: \n[Wherefore, that the pontifical crown may be maintained in dignity, \n\n\n\nIndex of \nProhibited Books \n\n(Index Librorum \nProhibitorum) The \nfirst official edition \nappeared in 1 5 59, \nthough ecclesiastical \nauthorities censored, \ncondemned, and \ndestroyed various \nkinds of books from the \nearliest centuries of \nthe Christian era. \nCatholics were \nforbidden to read any \nbooks listed on the \nIndex, which was \nregularly updated. \nObservation of this \nprohibition was \nobligatory up to 1966, \nwhen Pope Paul VI \nsuppressed the Index. \n\n\n\n319 \n\n\n\nfork \n\n\n\nDavid Blondel \n\nTheologian who \nwrote Pseudo-Isidorus \net Turrianus \nVapulantes (Geneva, \n1628) to demonstrate \nthe spurious nature of \nearlier defenses of \nthe False Decretals. \n\nLorenzo Valla \n\n1 5th-century Italian \nhumanist and critic \nof the church, \nemployed as a \nsecretary to King \nAlfonso V of Siciliy, \nwho protected Valla \nfrom the Inquisition. \nLater, he was \nreconciled to the \npapacy and even \nappointed an \napostolic secretary by \nPope Nicholas V \n\n\n\n, \n\n\n\nwe hand over and relinquish our palaces, the City of Rome, and all the \nprovinces, places, and cities of Italy and the regions of the West to the \nmost blessed pontiff and Universal Pope, Sylvester." But the real \ncomposer of the Donation, a papal official named Christophorus, \nmade serious historical mistakes. He made Constantine call himself \nconqueror of the Huns, fifty years before they appeared in Europe. \nHe called the bishop of Rome "pope" two hundred years before the \ntitle was used. 2 \n\nLorenzo Valla proved the spurious nature of the Donation as earl \nas 1440. He wrote: "Even if it had been genuine, it would by now \nhave been rendered void by the crimes alone of the Papacy, through \nwhose avarice Italy has been plunged in constant war." 3 The church \nrefused to admit the fraud until nearly four centuries later. A Greek \nsaying was that the chief industry of papal Rome was fabrication of \nfalse documents. After setting the precedent, "Nearly every pontificate \nwill add its supplement of false documents to this formidable corpus \nwhence the theologians, St. Thomas Aquinas among them, will for a \nlong period confidently derive the justification for whatever the \nRoman Pontiffs may desire to do or say." 4 The Gospels themselves \nwere forged as required to uphold privileges and practices of the early \nchurch. "We must never forget that the majority of the writings of the \nNew Testament were not really written or published by those whose \nnames they bear." 5 \n\nAfter burning books and closing pagan schools, the church dealt in \nanother kind of forgery: falsification by omission. All European \nhistory was extensively edited by a church that managed to make itself \nthe sole repository of literary and historical records. With all impor- \ntant documents assembled in the monasteries, and the lay public \nrendered illiterate, Christian history could be forged with impunity. \n\n1. White 2, 314. 2. Chamberlin, B.

It was also a phallic symbol of the god\'s sacred marriage. 2 Thej \n"thieves\' cross" in Christian iconography had the same shape. Such \ncrosses flanking Jesus\'s cross may have represented sacred marriage. \nThe Y-shaped fork was sometimes regarded as a female genital \nsymbol, in conjunction with the male trident or three-pronged fork. 5 \n\nThe voodoo savior-god Legba characteristically used as his crutch \na derivative of the sacred furka of Set. 4 \n\n1 .

Caesars "constantly had before them, even during sleep or on \nvoyages, a golden statue of the goddess, which on their death they \ntransmitted to their successor and which they invoked under the name \npi Fortuna Regia, a translation of Tyche Basileos (Fate of the \nRulership)." l \n\nGreek Tyche was the same as Fortuna. When she was a Fate \nattached to an individual, like a guardian angel, she was a psyche \nssoul) or anima (spirit). Her Roman name Fortuna may have descended \nfrom Vortumna, "She Who Turns the Year," the Great Mother \nturning the celestial wheel of the stars and also the karmic wheel of \nfate. 2 \n\nUnder the name of Agatha, "Kindly Fortune," the Goddess was \nassociated with a serpent-consort, Agathodemon, a genius of kindly \nrate. 3 On the Orphic Bowl of the 5th century a.d. he appeared next to \nher in the guise of the Lord of Death, "halfway around the circle, at \nhe point of midnight . . . holding in his right hand the poppy stalk of the \nBleep of death, turned downward." 4 In this case Fortuna and her \nconsort stood for a fortunate life followed by a gentle death. The \nGoddess\'s favored ones went to her paradise in the far west, often \nballed the Fortunate Isles. \n\nOn the Goddess\'s magic wheel of time, odd numbers were sacred \n|o her, even numbers to her consort. Roman religious festivals were \nIcheduled for the odd-numbered "female" days, because they were \n[upposed to be more propitious than "male" days. 5 \n\nFortuna became patroness of gamblers when her fate-wheel was \n\nlecularized as the carnival Wheel of Fortune, and she was renamed \n\nLady Luck. In England she was transformed into a fairy-creature called \n\nji "portune," which might lead horses astray, make travelers lose their \n\nIvay, and other pranks. 6 Like most other forms of the Goddess she was \n\nConverted into a malicious spirit. \n\n1.

Bernhardt, 245, 257-58, 288, \n\n\n\nSecond Book of \nEsdras (also known as \nthe Ezra Apocalypse) \nOne of the \napocryphal books \neliminated from the \nEnglish Bible but \nappearing as an \nappendix to the New \nTestament in the \nLatin Vulgate. \n\n\n\nFreeWill \n\nTheological doctrine stated that God allows human beings to be \ntempted into evil, so by a personal decision each individual may "freely" \nelect to resist temptation or not. The doctrine was developed in \nanswer to the argument that God could prevent sin if he wanted to, and \nbecause he did not prevent it, there was something wrong with him, \nnot with humanity. As 2 Esdras put it: "It had been better not to have \ngiven the earth unto Adam; or else, when it was given him, to have \nrestrained him from sinning. For what profit is it for men now in this \npresent time to live in heaviness, and after death to look for \npunishment?" \n\nThe problem was to absolve God from suspicion of a frivolous \nmalice, like that of a child who teases an animal with food, then \npunishes it for eating. If God was all-knowing then he must have known \nin advance what man would choose, which would take the element of \nsurprise out of human sins. On the other hand, if God couldn\'t foresee \nwhat man would choose, and could be surprised by human actions, \nhe wasn\'t all-knowing. \n\n\n\n322 \n\n\n\nScotus Erigena piously tried to thrash his way out of the paradox \nwith a new dogma of "divine ignorance," but unfortunately succeed- \ned in demonstrating that God fails to understand what he created. \nErigena said: "There is another kind of ignorance in God, inasmuch \nas he may be said not to know what things he foreknows and predestines \nuntil they have appeared experientially in the course of created \n\nevents There is a third kind of divine ignorance, in that God may \n\nbe said to be ignorant of things not yet made manifest in their effects \nthrough experience of their action and operation; of which, neverthe- \nless, he holds the invisible cause in himself, by himself created, and to \nhimself known." 2 \n\nThese subtleties added up to a statement that God doesn\'t know \nwhat he knows, with a hidden conclusion that man is smarter than \nGod, because man (that is, Erigena) knows all about what God knows \nand what God doesn\'t know. Theologians who wrote learnedly on \nthe subject of God\'s ignorance were going out on a limb, claiming that \nthey could scrutinize and analyze what they themselves declared \ninscrutable. So troublesome did the doctrine of free will become that \nsome Protestant sects, such as Calvinist Presbyterianism, abandoned \nit altogether in favor of predestination, stating that every person was \nalready saved or damned from birth by God\'s unalterable decree. \nThis idea restored God\'s omniscience, but eroded the incentive to live a \ngodly life. \n\nThere was an eastern folk tale that allegorized the relationship \nbetween God and humanity as between a wizard-shepherd and his \nflock of remarkably intelligent sheep. Knowing that their master would \neventually kill, skin, and eat them, the sheep kept trying to run away, \nand proved very troublesome. At last the shepherd used his magic \npower to put his sheep into a hypnotic trance and gave them \nsuggestions that they would internalize as their own beliefs. He told \n[them they were immortal, so death could do them no harm. He \nold them to trust in their master\'s goodness no matter what happened \nto them. Finally, he told them not to think about their fate at all, \nDecause it wouldn\'t happen right away. There was no need to anticipate \nit. Then the sheep became obedient, and stopped trying to escape. \nEach one quietly awaited its own death at the master\'s hand, believing \nthat it had decided to do so of its own free will. 3 \n\nOne of the "suppressed" verses of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam \nIso made nonsense of the doctrine of free will, after the fashion of \nhe author of Esdras. In this verse, not man but God was made \nesponsible for the Fall, since he had foreseen it, planned it, and \nsupplied the circumstances that made it inevitable: \n\nO Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make, \nAnd even with Paradise devise the Snake; \nFor all the sin wherewith the Face of Man \nIs blackened, Man \'s forgiveness give and take! \nl.H.

Frea, Frigga, \nFrigg \n\n\n\nFreya had many \nalternate names. She \nwas Gerd the Earth \nMother, or Eartha; \nGodiva, "the \nGoddess"; Syr, "the \nSow"; Gefn, "the \nGiver"; Horn, the holy \nharlot; the Vanadis; \nor Mardoll, the Moon \nShining Over the \nSea. 8 Sometimes she \nwas simply Lofn, \n"Love." 9 She was also \nidentified with \nMana, the Moon; or \nHel, the underworld; \nor Nerthus, the primal \nGoddess of the Plow, \nin charge of the fertility \nof the earth; she \nseparated the island of \nZealand from \nSweden by plowing a \nfurrow around it. 10 \n\n\n\nFreya \n\nGreat Goddess of northern Europe, leader of the "primal matri- \narchs" called Afliae, "powerful ones," or Disk, "divine grandmothers": \nthe same as the Hindu matrikadevis or mother goddesses. Freya was \nthe Vanadis, the ruling ancestress (dfs) of the Vanir or elder gods, who \nruled before the arrival of Odin and the patriarchal Aesir ("Asians") \nfrom the east. Myths said Odin learned everything he knew about magic \nand divine power from Freya. 1 \n\nThe pagans said nothing could be lucky without Freya\'s presence. \nEven the gods languished and began to decline toward death, like \nmortals, when Freya was taken from them. 2 \n\nLike all forms of the Goddess, Freya represented sexual love, \nwhich is why her alternate name Frigg became a colloquialism for \nsexual intercourse. Her consort Frey sometimes took the form of a \nphallus. In Uppsala his name was Fricco, "Lover," cognate with the \nphallic god Priapus, from the Indo-European root prij, to make love \nwhich also gave rise to the modern "prick." 3 \n\nThough he was sometimes called Freya\'s twin brother, like the \nArtemis-Apollo, Isis-Osiris pairs, Frey made a lingam-yoni combina- \ntion with Freya. Their names meant "the Lord" and "the Lady." 4 \nSome writers identified them with Attis and Cybele, tracing Frigga to \n"Frigia" or Phrygia, the Magna Mater\'s home. 5 \n\nFrey was the god of Yule, the pagan solstitial festival assimilated to \nChristmas. At the turning of the solar year he was born of his virgin- \nmother-sister-bride. 6 Like other seasonal gods he had a perpetual rival, \nNjord, the other half of the year. They were collectively blotgodar \n(blood-gods), who fought and sacrificed each other over and over. Njord \nwas called the first god of the Swedes, having ruled before Odin \nbrought alien gods from Asia. Frey was another aspect of him, wor- \nshipped in the sacred grove at Uppsala long before it was taken over \nby Odin\'s priests. 7 The grove itself stood for the body of the Goddess. \n\nMany of Freya\'s names were only kennings (metaphors) from the \nhymns composed in her honor by her skalds. Focusing on the theme \nof love, and known as mansongr, "woman songs," these compositions jj \nwere specifically forbidden by the medieval church. 11 Despite the \nopposition of the clergy, Germans persisted in believing that Freya\'s \nsacred day, Friday, was the luckiest day for weddings. 12 \n\nFreya or one of her equivalents married each of the early Swedish ; \nkings: "They were regarded in heathen times as the husbands of the \nfertility goddess. . . . [T]hey suffered a real or symbolic death in that \ncapacity when their time of supremacy came to an end." Scandina- \nvian Aryans followed the typical pattern of sacred marriage between \nGoddess and king, the latter becoming identified with the male \nfertility deity whose function it was "to die for the land and for his \npeople, while the goddess never dies. Her function is to weep over \nhim, perhaps to help bring about his return, or to give birth to the divine a \nchild who is to take his place." 13 (See Kingship.) \n\n\n\n324 \n\n\n\nAfter their abrupt sacrificial deaths, Freya kept the spirits of slain Friday \n\nkings and heroes in her Fensalirox Marsh-halls, also called Folk- \n\nvangr, the Field of Warriors. 14 They could be reborn after spending a ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ncycle of time in the wet, fertile earth-womb. Freya\'s Marsh-halls \nrecall the "bog" where Baal-Hadad lay for seven years before he was \nresurrected to godhood by priestesses of Asherah. 15 Like the early \nSemitic worshippers of the Great Mother, Aryans were "men of \nclay" the meaning of their name because their bodies came forth \nfrom Modir. This meant the root of both "mud" and "mother"; she was \nthe same primal creatress whom the Russians called Moist Mother \nEarth. 16 Modir too was another manifestation of Freya. \n\nShe was especially linked with the strange archaic god Heimdall, \nwhose name meant "a ram," undoubtedly one of the ubiquitous \nanimal substitutes for a human sacrifice. The ram\'s horn was Heimdall\'s \nringing Gjallarhorn, on which he blew the Last Trump to announce \nthe coming of doomsday and the world\'s destruction. In the Bible, \nmagic ram\'s horns were supposed to bring about the destruction of \nJericho in the same manner. 17 The link between Heimdall and Freya \nsuggested her Kali-like function as a Destroying Goddess, which she \nwould assume when men and gods displeased her by forgetting her \nprinciples of right living, justice, honor, and peace. She knew more \nmagic than the gods. Her knowledge was collectively seidr, cognate of \nSanskrit siddhi, the miraculous powers developed by the practice of \nyoga. \n\nFreya had so many incarnations and aspects that the scholars who \ntried to characterize her by only one of them soon ran into a mass of \ncontradictions. She was called the Goddess of fertility, love, the moon, \nthe sea, the earth, the underworld, death, birth; virgin, mother, \nancestress, queen of heaven, ruler of fate, of the stars, of magic; the \nGreat Sow wedded to the sacrificial boar; the Mistress of Cats; the \nleader of Valkyries; the Saga or "sayer" who inspired all sacred poetry. \nIn sum, she was as many-sided as any other version of the Goddess. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 144-59. 2.

Friday \nthe 13 th was said to be especially unlucky because it combined the \nGoddess\'s sacred day with her sacred number, drawn from the 1 3 \nmonths of the pagan lunar year. (See Menstrual Calendar.) \nRomans named the day dies Veneris after Venus, their own \n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 \n\n\n\nFrog \nFuji \n\n\n\nversion of the same Goddess. In modern French, Friday is still \nvendredi, 1 and in Italian, venerdi. \n\nFriday used to be the seventh day of the week. It was the Sabbath \nof the Jewish lunar calendar and is still the Sabbath of Islam. \nScandinavian pagans, Hindus, and rural Scots insisted that Friday was \nthe most propitious day for a marriage because it was the day that \nfavored fertility. \n\nFish were eaten on Friday as fertility charms, in honor of Venus \n(or Freya) whose totems they were. Fish are still considered "aphro- \ndisiac" food because they were sacred to Aphrodite. Thus the Catholic \nhabit of eating fish on Friday was wholly pagan in origin. But the \nchurch never acknowledged the debt. In the Middle Ages, when pagan \nvotaries of Freya continued to celebrate her rites on Friday, church- \nmen designated her day as the day of "devil worship." 2 \n\n1.

Subjects were \nusually magical or \nreligious. \n\n\n\nFrog \n\nMedieval totems of witches were frogs because ancient traditions \nassociated the frog with Hecate Egypt\'s Hekat, Queen of the Heaven- \nly midwives. Egyptians made the frog a symbol of the fetus. Hekat\'s \nsacred Amulet of the Frog bore the words, "I Am the Resurrection," \nanother phrase of birth-magic copied by early Christians. 1 \n\nIn Rome, the frog was sacred to Venus, of whom Hecate was one \naspect. Her triple yoni sometimes was shown as a fleur-de-lis com- \nposed of three frogs. 2 To this day, a garment closure of cord shaped like \na fleur-de-lis is called a "frog." Tailors\' folklore said every garment \nshould have exactly nine frogs, which might be traced all the way back \nto Babylonian cylinder seals showing nine frogs as a fertility charm: \nthe Ninefold Goddess ruling the nine months of gestation. 3 \n\n1.

(See Furies \n\nMountain.) \n\n1 . Campbell, P.M., 336. \n\n\n\nFuries \n\nAlso called Erinyes or Eumenides, the Furies personified the venge- \nful moods of the Triple Goddess Demeter, who was also called Erinys \nas a punisher of sinners. The three Erinyes were emanations of her. \n\n"Whenever their number is mentioned there are three of them But \n\nthey can all be mentioned together as a single being, an Erinys. The \n\nproper meaning of the word is a \'spirit of anger and revenge\' Above \n\nall they represented the Scolding Mother. Whenever a mother was \ninsulted, or perhaps even murdered, the Erinyes appeared. Like swift \nbitches they pursued all who had flouted blood-kinship and the \ndeference due to it." \' \n\nGreeks believed the blood of a slain mother infected her murderer \nwith a dread spiritual poison, miasma, the Mother\'s Curse. It drew \nthe implacable Furies to their victim, and also infected any who dared \nhelp him. In fear of the Furies\' attention, lest they might have \ninadvertently assisted a matricide, people called the Furies "Good \nOnes" (Eumenides), hoping to divert their wrath. \n\nAeschylus called the Furies "Children of Eternal Night." Sopho- \ncles called them "Daughters of Earth and Shadow." Their individual \nnames were Tisiphone (Retaliation-Destruction), Megaera (Grudge), \nand Alecto (the Unnameable). Some said they were born of the \nblood of the castrated Heavenly Father, Uranus; others said they were \nolder than any god. 2 Their antiquity is demonstrated by the fact that \nthey were invoked against killers of kinfolk in the female line only: a \nrelic of the matriarchal age, when all genealogies were reckoned \nthrough women. 3 \n\nAeschylus\'s drama The Eumenides presented the Furies pursuing \nDrestes for killing his mother, Queen Clytemnestra; but they cared \nlothing for the murder of the father. He was not a real member of the \n:lan. When Orestes asked them why they didn\'t punish Clytemnestra \nor murdering her husband, they answered, "The man she killed was \nlot of blood congenital." Orestes inquired (as if he didn\'t know), \n\'But am I then involved with my mother by blood bond?" The Furies \nnapped, "Murderer, yes. How else could she have nursed you \n>eneath her heart? Do you forswear your mother\'s intimate blood?" 4 In \nhort, the Furies harked back to a matriarchal clan system like the one \nn pre-Christian Britain, where "the son loved the father no more than a \nstranger." 5 Indeed the name of the archaic Triple Goddess of \nIreland, Erin, or Eriu, has been linked with the triple Erinyes. 6 \n\nThe Furies were also "fairies," identified with witches because of \n\n\n\n327 \n\n\n\nFurrow their ability to lay curses on any who transgressed their law. Such \n\n"fairies" may have been real witches who tried to defend the rights of \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ women against encroachment by Christian laws. Their modus ope- \nrandi could have been similar to that of the Women\'s Devil Bush \nsociety in Africa: if a woman complained to this society that her \nhusband abused her, he soon died of a mysterious dose of poison. 7 \n\nChristianity adopted the Furies, incongruously enough, as servants \nof the patriarchal God. They became part of God\'s penal system in \nhell: dog-faced she-demons known as Furies Who Sow Evil, Accusers \nor Examiners, and Avengers of Crimes. 8 Their duty, as always, was \nto punish sinners. As "grotesques" they appeared on the tympanum of \nBourges Cathedral, with large pregnant bellies bearing the full \nmoon\'s Gorgon face, and pendulous breasts terminating in dogs\' \nheads. 9 Greek art, however, depicted them as stern-faced but beauti- \nful women, bearing torches and scourges, with serpents wreathed in \ntheir hair like the Gorgons. 10 \n\nAlthough classical tradition understood the Fury as a symbol of the \nimpersonal functioning of justice, yet she came to represent men\'s \nhidden fear of women, an image apparently still viable. Psychiatric \nWorldview says: \n\nTo those men who are aware of contemporary changes it becomes \nabundantly clear that there are a number of openly angry women \naround. . . . Men trained to recognize and enhance their own anger and \naggressiveness in a society where rape and revenge are commonplace \nview angry women with alarm. . . . Men see women project onto them the \nfull extent of their own potential aggressiveness. The spectre of an \nangry Fury or Medusa \'s head strikes fear in men, which is then often \nawkwardly handled because men are not supposed to display fear. A \nwoman seeking only reasonable social or vocational equity may be \nperceived by a man as being out to get the kind of revenge that his \npride would require had he experienced the narcissistic and practical \nwounds that she has sustained.

Indian scriptures made the Earth-mother \nSita, "Furrow," the wife of Rama, whose name meant "Enjoyment \nof Virility" and who was an incarnation of the phallic Krishna. 1 Ancient \nEgypt celebrated an important annual rite called "the finding of the \nscepter of flint in the furrow of [the Goddess] Maat." 2 Similarly, Rome \nkept a sexual-symbolic festival devoted to finding "the flints of \nJupiter" in a sacred furrow representing Ceres or Ops, Mother Earth. 5 \nThe city of Rome itself was established by plowing a furrow, an act \n\n\n\n328 \n\n\n\nattributed to the legendary Romulus. A pre-Roman ancestral hero Furrow \n\ncalled Tages was said to be "born from the furrow" as a son of Mother \n\nEarth. 4 ^^^^^ \n\nThe name of the zodiacal sign of the Virgin originally meant \n"Furrow." 5 Its principal star, Spica, was known in Babylon as "the \ncorn-ear of the Goddess Shala." Corn-ear meant the shibboleth dis- \nplayed at the culmination of the rites of Ishtar, Astarte, and Demeter, \nall of whom were also the Furrow. Demeter made Iasion or Iasus her \nlover "in a thrice-plowed field," giving him the name of Triptolemus, \n"Three Plowings," because he entered the Furrow three times. He was \nalso surnamed Soter, meaning both "Savior" and "Sower." \n\nSeed entering the furrow was almost invariably likened to semen \nentering the womb, as shown by numerous pagan savior-gods who \nentered their Mother in the form of seed and were reborn as new \nvegetation. The Latin god Semo Sancus, whose name meant both \n"seed" and "semen," mated thus with Ops and died in her embrace, to \nregenerate himself. 6 \n\nThe classic custom of plowing a furrow for magical protection \naround a town was perpetuated by country folk all over Europe. \nEven in the 20th century, Russian villages were annually "purified" by \nthe same ceremony, which remained exclusively in the hands of \nwomen. Nine virgins and three old women (representing the Fate \nsisters, or Zorya) plowed a furrow around the village at midnight, \ncalling on the Moon-goddess. Armed with scythes, clubs, and animal \nskulls, they struck down and beat any man they happened to \nencounter while performing this magic. 7 \n\n1. 0\'Flaherty, 554; Avalon, 607. 2.

He was carried to heaven by angels. 1 \n\nWhen the monks rewrote his story, Galahad was viewed as a purer \nknight than his father-predecessor Lancelot, whose life was marred by I \n"the vile sin of lust." Galahad was chosen to realize the Grail quest \nbecause he was the only knight in the whole company of the Round \nTable who was still virgin. 2 This Christianized Galahad was said to have j \ndescended from Joseph of Arimathea; but another author announced \nthrough Guinevere that Galahad was a descendant of Jesus himself. 3 \n\n1.

Galileo \n\nrhe story probably arose from a ritual of invocation, to call down the \n\nGoddess\'s spirit into her sculptured eidolon. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nGalatea was another name not only for Aphrodite but also for \nEgyptian Hathor the Celestial Cow, and Phoenician Astarte, the \nlame milk-giving Mother. Pygmalion was a Hellenized version of her \niigh priest Pumiyathon at Byblos. 2 \n\nCeltic tribes from Galatia named after her also worshipped the \nhilk-giving Mother as Galata, from whom Gauls and Gaels traced \nheir descent. 3 Their early-medieval hero Galahad was one of her sacred \nlings. He was a Gaulish form of Heracles, who married the Gauls\' \nncestral Goddess Galata, sometimes symbolized in Britain as Albion, \nhe White Moon, source of the Milky Way. Heracles also was a \nplar hero who lived for a year like Galahad in the palace of the \nGoddess, at the hub of the spinning wheel of the galaxy (Milky \nWay). In this Lydian story the Goddess was called Omphale, the \ncenter," or omphalos. When the year turned around this hub full \nlircle, Heracles too was supposed to die the year-god\'s death in a fiery \nIheel. 4 \n\nAll the names of Galatea-Galata-Galatia were based on gala, \nmother\'s milk," for the Goddess was supposed to have made the \nLheel of the stars and constellations from her own milk. 5 Therefore the \nMoon-goddess often appeared in ancient iconography as the divine \nlow, horned like the moon. \n\n1.

Before Galileo, all Christendom accepted \nle church\'s view that man and his works stood at the center of the \nniverse, on a fixed earth surrounded by "spheres" of sun, moon, \nlanets, and stars. This was the biblical view, supported by such \n\nrlibles as Albert the Great, Isidore of Seville, St. Thomas Aquinas. \nThe Dark Age had destroyed or forgotten ancient astronomers\' \nowledge of the solar system. Aristarchus taught about 275 B.C. that \nle earth is a revolving globe in orbit around the sun. Eratosthenes \nx>ut 250 b.c. calculated the circumference of the globe at 24,662 \nliles, less than 300 miles short of the true figure, 24,902. About \n40 b.c, Hipparchus calculated the diameter of the moon, and its \nistance from the earth, within a few miles of the correct figures. 1 But \ncording to Christian authorities, this information was pagan and \nlerefore heretical and wrong. \n\nAlmost two millenia later, Nicholas Copernicus patiently observed \nnd calculated his way back to the knowledge that the earth moves \n\n\n\n333 \n\n\n\nGalileo \n\n\n\nIndex of \nProhibited Books \n\n(Index Librorum \nProhibitorum) The \nfirst official edition \nappeared in 1559, \nthough ecclesiastical \nauthorities censored, \ncondemned, and \ndestroyed various \nkinds of books from the \nearliest centuries of \nthe Christian era. \nCatholics were \nforbidden to read any \nbooks listed on the \nIndex, which was \nregularly updated. \nObservation of this \nprohibition was \nobligatory up to 1966, \nwhen Pope Paul VI \nsuppressed the Index. \n\n\n\naround the sun. After hesitating and re-checking his results for nearly 1 \nthirty years, Copernicus published his book in 1 543. It was not well \nreceived by Catholics or Protestants. Martin Luther scoffed at it: \n"People give ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that the \nearth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the \nmoon. . . . This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astrono- \nmy; but sacred scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun to \nstand still, and not the earth." 2 \n\nThe Roman church investigated Copernicus\'s theory by consult- \ningthe scriptures, and placed his book on the Index of Prohibited \nBooks, where it remained until 1835. The pope announced, "The first \nproposition, that the sun is the center and does not revolve about the \nearth, is foolish, absurd, false in theology and heretical, because express- \nly contrary to Holy Scripture. The second proposition, that the earth \nrevolves about the sun and is not the center, is absurd, false in \nphilosophy and . . . opposed to the true faith." \n\nCopernicus\'s calculations nevertheless fascinated Giordano Bruno, \nwho accepted the heliocentric theory, attacked St. Thomas Aquinas\'s I \ncosmology of the spheres, published an early elucidation of the nebular \nhypothesis, and even developed something like a theory of evolution. I \nHe also doubted the reality of witchcraft and asserted that most women \nburned at the stake were innocent. He was silenced in the same way: I \nburned on the Campo dei Fiori in 1600. \n\nTen years later, Galileo\'s little telescope revealed the phases of \nVenus, the moons of Jupiter, and the moving spots on the sun. Galileo \ninvited clergymen to look through the telescope for themselves, but \nthey refused, saying it would imperil their souls because objects like the \nmoons of Jupiter were illusions of the devil. The Church said there \ncould be only seven planets, because scripture presented seven archan- \ngels, seven churches of Asia, seven golden candlesticks, and other \nsuch allegories. One of the church\'s main objections at the time to \nGalileo\'s discoveries was that they upset the received knowledge of \nthe zodiacal system; learned ecclesiastics leaned heavily on the guidance \nof astrology. \n\nIn 1632, Galileo published his Dialogue, with overwhelming prod \nof the Copernican theory. There was a storm of opposition from the | \nchurch, which went on for many years and involved priests, cardinals, I \nand two popes. A document was forged and "found" in the church\'s I \nfiles, to the effect that Galileo had been previously forbidden to teach or \ndiscuss Copernicanism, on pain of punishment by the Inquisition. \nGalileo was arrested, threatened with torture, and forced to abjure on I \nhis knees, vowing to "curse and detest the error and the heresy of the I \nmovement of the earth." According to legend, he went on to whisper I \nunder his breath, Eppursimuove "But it does move." Pope Paul \nV closed the subject with a solemn statement: "The doctrine of the \ndouble motion of the earth about its axis and about the sun is false, \nand entirely contrary to Holy Scripture." 3 \n\n\n\n334 \n\n\n\nThe pope forbade interment of Galileo\'s remains in his family \ntomb, directing that he be buried without ceremony, monument, or \nepitaph. His memory was execrated for two centuries, for what Pope \nUrban VIII called "so great a scandal to Christendom." Ecclesiastical \ncensors ordered that a later scientific work calling Galileo "renowned" \nmust alter the word to "notorious." In 1846, Monsignor Marini was \ngiven the job of publishing the records of Galileo\'s trial and falsifying \nthem to the church\'s advantage. The deception was uncovered by \nM. L\'Epinois twenty years later. 4 \n\nMany books were hurried forth under ecclesiastical auspices to \nconfute Galileo. Some contained very quaint reasoning, like \nChiaramonti\'s: \n\nAnimals, which move, have limbs and muscles; the earth has no limbs or \nmuscles, therefore it does not move. It is angels who make Saturn, \nJupiter, the sun, etc., turn round. If the earth revolves, it must also have an \nangel in the center to set it in motion; but only devils live there; it \nwould therefore be a devil who would impart motion to the earth. 5 \n\nThe naive theology of the time often declared that if the earth \nmoved, a stone dropped from a height would fall some way behind the \nspot directly below. Theology was shackled to the dictum of St. \nAugustine: "Nothing is to be accepted save on the authority of the \nScripture, since greater is that authority than all the powers of the \nhuman mind." 6 Voetius in 17th-century Utrecht repeated the same \ndictum: "Not a word is contained in the Holy Scriptures which is not \nin the strictest sense inspired, the very punctuation not excepted." 7 \n\nEven in the late 1 9th century, churchmen were still beating the \ndead horse of biblical cosmology. A president of the Lutheran \nTeachers\' Seminary published a book refuting Copernicus, Galileo, \nKepler, Newton, and all subsequent astronomers: \n\nThe entire Holy Scripture settles the question that the earth is the \nprincipal body of the universe, that it stands fixed, and that sun and \nmoon serve only to light it. . . . God never lies, never makes a mistake; ou \nof his mouth comes only truth when he speaks of the structure of the \nuniverse, of the earth, sun, moon, and stars. 8 \n\nIn 1885 the Catholic scholar St. George Mivart realized that \nGod had indeed lied about the structure of the universe, and hypothe- \nsized that God had deliberately led his popes and cardinals into error \njin order to teach them that astronomy lay outside their jurisdiction. This \n[became the accepted Catholic view of the Galileo fiasco. 9 It was a \n(view that did irreparable damage to the doctrine of papal infallibility, and \nlopened the way to future doubts about God\'s veracity. If he deceived \nIhis chosen envoys in one matter, who could be sure he didn\'t deceive \nIthem in others? \n\nThe battle with Galileo set the pattern for three centuries of \n[ecclesiastical condemnation of each new discovery in an Age of \nEnlightenment when almost all scientific knowledge was found to be \n\n\n\nGalileo \n\n\n\nM.

Bernouilli was forced to \nexpunge from his works the proof that the living body constantly \nchanges its parts, because this contradicted the church\'s doctrine of the \nresurrection of the flesh. The Egyptologist Sir J. G. Wilkinson had to \n"modify" ancient Egyptian chronology because it interfered with the \nbiblical flood myth. Dr. Franz Gall was forbidden to study the struc- \nture of the human brain on the ground that it was "blasphemous." 10 \nNearly every important scientific book of these three centuries \nappeared on the Index of Prohibited Books, "infallibly" declared false \nbecause it contradicted the Bible. The biologist Huxley said he encoun- \ntered in every path of natural science a barrier reading: "No \nthoroughfare. Moses." 11 In 1832, Pope Gregory XVI\'s encyclical \nMirari vos declared war on (1) all forms of society founded on liberty \nof conscience; (2) liberty of the press, "which cannot be sufficiently \nexecrated and condemned, for by its means all evil doctrines are \npropagated"; and (3) liberty of scientific research. 12 Stanton says, "All \nthrough the centuries scholars and scientists have been imprisoned, \ntortured and burned alive for some discovery which seemed to conflict \nwith a petty text of Scripture." 13 The Galileo case was the very \nbeginning of a long retreat. \n\nI.

Garlic and garlic-eaters were taboo in Greco-Roman \ntemples of the Mother of the Gods.

Prince of Gehenna was Arsiel, copied from the \nBabylonian netherworld god Aciel, "Black Sun," negative aspect of the \nsun god. 2 In Gehenna\'s central pit lived the serpent-angel Apollyon, \nanother name for the same negative aspect of the sun god Apollo \n(Revelation 9:11). \n\n1.

Each Roman man had his personal genius \nas a guardian angel or familiar; each woman had a corresponding \nfemale spirit called a juno. 1 In the time of the empire, the word genius \ncame to be applied to both sexes. Official prayers were addressed to \nthe "Genius of Rome, whether masculine or feminine, whether god or \ngoddess." 2 \n\nThe meaning of genius changed again in the Middle Ages, when it \nwas virtually synonymous with "spirit." One could speak of a genius \nloci, spirit of a place; or an "evil genius," a demon. The modern \nmeaning, an exceptionally intelligent or inspired person, was of late \norigin. In 1875 a.d., James Hinton defined genius as "the woman in \nman." 3 In this sense a genius was very similar to a Muse or a Shakti. \n\n1. Rose, 193. 2. Dumezil, 39. 3.

Medieval custom \nhonored St. George on Easter Monday, the Moon-day following the \nSun-day of the Christian hero. Folklore named the pagan savior Green \nGeorge, a spirit of spring. 1 His image was common in old church \ncarvings, a human head surrounded by leaves or looking out of a tree \ntrunk. Some called him the witches\' god, "a confused idea of \nsomething between a tree and a man," or "the devil in the shape of a \ntrunk of a tree . . . with some form of a human face." 2 \n\nSt. George the Dragon-slayer apparently evolved from a mythic \nmeld of Green George with an Arian bishop of Alexandria who \nopposed St. Athanasius, and put to death an orthodox Master of the \nMint named Dracontius, "Dragon." ? \n\nSt. George\'s emblem was a vesica piscis, a prime fertility symbol \nbecause it represented the Goddess\'s yoni; but Christian authorities \npreferred to interpret it as a "shield." Still, George was so shamelessly \ninvolved in fertility rites that the church discredited him and began \n\n\n\n339 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGhora calling him "the imaginary saint." An old English ballad said: "Some \n\nGiants say there was no George; some, that there no Dragon was; pray God, \n\n^ mmmmmmm ^^^^ m there was at least a maid." 4 \n\n1. Frazer, G.B., 145-46. 2.

Ghora personified a primal taboo, as did the Greek Gorgon \nwho was also "Horrible." Ghora was destructive, therefore sacrificed \nwith his siblings "for the sake of the three universes," for these boar- \nchildren were capable of destroying even the gods in the highest \nheaven. 1 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty, 193-96. \n\n\n\nGhost \n\nA cognate of "guest," both words rooted in Germanic Geist, original- \nly a spirit of a dead ancestor invited to tribal feasts on such occasions as \nSamhain (Halloween) and other solemn ceremonies. Many Europe- \nan peoples preserved the heads or skulls of ancestors, which were set up, \npainted, and decorated, in a prominent position at gatherings of the \nclan, and were consulted for oracles after being offered their portion of \nthe collation. Hence the "Death\'s-head at the feast." During later \nChristian times the custom was discouraged, for the church\'s doctrine of \nresurrection of the flesh forbade burial of bodies without heads. \nNevertheless, the visiting ghost was an ineradicable belief. Ghosts were \nsupposed to haunt all the scenes of their former lives, especially if \nthey died violently or unhappily, or were buried in unconsecrated \nground, or had possessed evil spirits. The earlier, more benevolent \ntype of family ghost is still suggested by the identical pronunciation of \n"ghost" and "guest" in northern England. 1 The anger of ghosts was \nmost feared by people who refused to honor them as guests. \nl.Hazlitt.27. \n\n\n\nGiants \n\nAppearing in every mythology as a primal Elder Race, giants \nwere obvious projections of every child\'s earliest perceptions of the adult \nworld. Like grownups seen through the eye of the toddler, giants \n\n\n\n340 \n\n\n\nItended to be fearsome, sometimes bloodthirsty but sometimes benevo- Giants \n\nBlent; possessors of an arcane ancient wisdom; and adepts of magic. \n\nAccording to the Bible, giants were like all Savior-figures up to and ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n(including Jesus: offspring of divine fathers and human mothers \n(Genesis 6:4). Semitic tradition held that all the biblical patriarchs were \n\n\n\nof enormous size. Abraham was seventy times as big as a modern \nman. Philo maintained that Adam was a giant. 1 Unlettered Arabs still \nsay the megalithic structures being studied by archeologists were not \nso hard for the ancient people to build, because those people were \ngiants. 2 \n\nLong before the Bible was written, Hindus were saying the same \nof the people of the Golden Age, in the childhood stage of humanity. \nLike parent figures, the earliest races were gigantic, sinless, wise, and \nlong-lived. They died only when they wished to. They could live a \nthousand years because, in their age, life was "centered in the blood" \ni.e., the immortal blood of the Goddess. 3 (See Menstrual Blood.) \nThat this life-giving blood was a feminine effluent is suggested by the \nstory of Thor\'s journey to Giant-land to learn the secrets of the \ngiants\' ancient magic; he could not find the right way until he crossed a \nriver of the giantesses\' menstrual blood. 4 In Greece, the similar river \nleading to the land of "ancestors" was the Styx. \n\nGreeks called the giants Titans, offspring of Mother Earth and \nFather Sky (Uranus). The heavenly Father was jealous of his chil- \ndren and tried to smother them by clinging too closely to Mother Earth \nto let them breathe air. Earth gave her son Cronus the moon-sickle \nand bade him castrate and kill his Father. Later, Cronus married Rhea \nthe Titaness another incarnation of the same Mother Earth and \nfeared the same Oedipal fate from the other end. To preserve his own \nlife, he swallowed his children. The mother saved one of them, Zeus, \nwho did indeed attack his father and marry the same Mother Earth \nunder a variety of her names Hera, Olympia, Rhea, Gaea, or \nDanae. The Oedipal theme of the father-son rivals almost always \nappears in connection with the giant-myths. 5 \n\nGreeks assigned to the Titans all the crude religious rites of their \nancestors, such as cannibalistic sacraments and dismemberment of \ndivine victims like Dionysus or Zagreus. As archaic earth-deities, the \nTitans battled the newer Olympian gods in a myth known as the \nGiants\' Revolt, paralleled by Persian, Jewish, and Christian stories of the \nWar in Heaven. 6 One of the mythic reasons given for the war was \nZeus\'s punishment of the Titans for eating Dionysus\'s flesh; but Zeus, \ninconsistently, himself devoured Dionysus\'s heart. \n\nLegends of giant ancestors were used by Christians to defend the \nfraudulent miracle-working bones of the Holy Innocents supposedly \nslaughtered by King Herod. When it was observed that these profitable \nbones were too large to have come from children less than two years \nof age, churchmen argued that the human frame was bigger in Herod\'s \ntime, because it was closer to the age of giants. 8 \n\nThe Irish said giant people still lived in "the chambered under- \n\n\n\n341 \n\n\n\nGiles, Saint grounds of Tara where dwell the fourth race of gods who settled \n\nGilgamesh Ireland." They were the Tuatha De Danann, people of the Goddess \n\n^ ^^^^^_ Dana, builders of stone temples. 9 Their Goddess passed into medi- \neval folklore as Titania, the Fairy Queen. 10 Curiously, though she was a \nTitaness and the Tuatha De Danann were giants, they shrank as \npopular belief in their powers waned before the encroachment of the \nnew religion. Eventually they became fairies or elves, not giants but \n"little people," the size of children or even smaller. 11 This reduction in \ntheir size was surely related to a reduction in awesomeness. Signifi- \ncantly, their religious myths became "fairy tales" for children, and many \nof their liturgies and sacred songs reappeared in the guise of nursery \nrhymes. \n\n1. Tennant, 134. 2.

His legend originated \nat Nimes, named after the Dianic moon-grave or nemeton. (See \nGrove, Sacred.) He was nurtured in a cave by a magic hind, the \nGoddess in deer shape. He was identified with the Celtic hero Oisin, \nwhose mother was a deer. 1 Like most Celtic Lords of the Hunt, he \nwas slain by arrows. Enacting the hero\'s Liebestod, as he died he \nclasped the same magic hind in his arms. \n\nSome said St. Giles was a Greek, born in Athens, possibly to \naccount for his connection with such deer-gods as Actaeon, whose \ncult was dedicated to the same Diana. 2 Another such hero was Tele- \nphus, king of Mysia. In infancy he was nursed by a doe and \ndiscovered by shepherds. An oracle sent him to Mysia where he married \nthe queen, his own mother Auge, in typically Oedipal fashion. 3 \n\nLike the smith-priests of the archaic Diana, St. Giles was lame, and \nso became the patron saint of cripples. Because of his enormous \npopularity, a fictitious "Life" was composed for him in the 10th \ncentury. More than 1 50 churches were dedicated to him, including \nSt. Giles Cripplegate in London and the high kirk in Edinburgh. 4 Yet \nhis legend had almost nothing Christian about it, and his sainthood \nwas based on forgery. \n\n1.

The principal extant text \ncame from the library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh, 7th century B.C.; \nbut older fragments reveal the story in Babylon at a much earlier date, \nthe beginning of the second millenium B.C. 1 \n\n\n\n342 \n\n\n\nFearful of death, Gilgamesh journeyed in search of Uta-Napishtim Glory-of-Elves \n\n(Noah), the flood hero who was the only immortal man, to learn his Gnosticism \n\nsecret. After many adventures Gilgamesh found the patriarch, who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nshowed him a magic "rose" of eternal life. Gilgamesh took the plant, \nbut it was stolen from him by a serpent. Thus the serpent became the \nonly immortal creature, capable of shedding its skin and becoming \nperiodically reborn without any sojourn in the land of death. \n\nOn his journey, Gilgamesh met the Goddess disguised as an \ninnkeeper that is, the dispenser of the Wine of Immortality to the \nI gods. She was called Siduri Sabitu, the Wine-Bearer, later adopted by \nSufi philosophers as the Goddess Saki, who poured for each man the \ncup of "reality revealed." 2 In Greek, she was Oenothea, "Wine- \ngoddess." 3 \n\nShe revealed reality to Gilgamesh by advising him to abandon the \nsearch for immortality, because the cruel gods decreed that all human \nIbeings must die. She told Gilgamesh to return home, to take pleasure in \nthe good things of life while he could: to bathe and dress himself, eat \nand drink, play with his children, make love to his wife, and "make \nJevery day a festival." 4 \n\nSiduri\'s live-for-today philosophy was copied into the ninth chapter \nof Ecclesiastes, a curiously pagan passage wherein the "word of God" \nIdenies the after-life with all its rewards or punishments, and the Judeo- \nIChristian deity dispenses no justice. \n\n1.

Gnosticism was a general term for mystery cults of the \nearly Christian era and for derivative heresies of the medieval period. \nTheir "knowledge" meant secrets of the after-life, spells and words of \npower required for advantageous placement in heaven, and revelations \nof the true nature of God. Leading Gnostic sects focused on the \nGreat Mother and her Dying God e.g., Eleusinian, Orphic, and \nOsirian mysteries. Angus says Gnosticism was "for over half a \nmillenium the approach to religion for thoughtful minds." \' \n\nTantric-style meditation and sexual rites figured in western Gnosti- \ncism, including sects that were fundamentally Christian.

At first \nhe was accounted a \nsaint, but three \ncenturies after his \ndeath he was declared \na heretic because of \nGnostic elements \nfound in his writings. \n\n\n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens Ter- \ntullianus) Influential \nearly Christian writer \nand father of the \nchurch, ca. 155-220 \na.d., born in Car- \nthage of pagan parents. \n\nIrenaeus Doctor, \nsaint, and father of the \nchurch, said to have \nlived in the 2nd century \na.d. as bishop of \nLyons. His history is \nobscure, largely \nbased on (possibly \nfraudulent) assertions \nof Eusebius, who \nclaimed to have \nletters from Irenaeus, \nbut none of these \nwere preserved. The \nstory of Irenaeus\'s \nmartyrdom has been \nproved false. \n\n\n\nfeminine power enfolding the original Creative Word, the Logos, so \nGnostic Christians sought communion with the Goddess Sige (Silence) \nwho dwelt at the beginning of all things. 2 She gave birth to Sophia \n(Wisdom, or Knowledge), the Gnostic Great Mother, both spouse and \nmother of God. \n\nSome Gnostics adopted the Oriental idea of the world soul, \nidentified with Sophia, sometimes in androgynous communion with \nGod. This was the view of the church father Origen, who was revered \nin his time but three centuries later excommunicated for holding \nheretical beliefs. 3 He said, "As our body while consisting of human \nmembers is yet held together by one soul, so the universe is to be \nthought of as an immense living being which is held together by one \nsoul." 4 The trouble with the world soul from the Christian point of \nview was that it mingled the blessed with the damned in one divine \nspirit, preventing the separation of sheep and goats that was thought \nnecessary at doomsday. \n\nThe orthodox church especially objected to Gnostic feminine \nimagery. It was impossible to see God deserving the Great Mother\'s \npunishment, as the Gnostics said he did. Followers of St. Paul de- \nnounced the Gnostics as firstborn of Satan, ravening wolves, \ndemoniacs, atheists, robbers, pirates, beasts in human shape, and dealers \nin deadly poison typical of the insults Christian traded with Chris- \ntian in those times. 5 \n\nFrom the 4th to the 8th centuries, the church incessantly persecut \ned Gnostic minorities. Nevertheless, "Secret fraternities perpetuated \nthe doctrines of Gnosticism and the illuminism of the Pagan religions \nfor many centuries after their supposed disappearance." 6 Gnostic cult \nobjects have been found throughout Sicily, Spain, and southern France, \nespecially the coffrets gnostiques or sacred boxes, like Greek cistae or \nSemitic "arks," dating from the early Middle Ages. 7 \n\nChurch fathers were particularly offended by the Gnostics\' pro- i \npensity to admit women to ecclesiastical rank: "All initiates, men and \nwomen alike . . . might be elected to serve as priest, bishop, or prophet" \nTertullian reported with horror that Gnostic women "teach, they \nengage in discussion; they exorcise; they cure." They even baptized, \nshowing that they had episcopal status. "They all have access equally, \nthey listen equally, they pray equally even pagans, if any happen to \ncome. . . .They also share the kiss of peace with all who come." 8 \n\nSome Gnostic groups went so far as to claim the true revelation ofi \nesoteric Christianity came through a woman, the "apostle to the \napostles," Mary Magdalene, Jesus\'s beloved. They prayed to a two- * \nsexed deity addressed as Father and Mother, identified with Jesus and j \nMary. Irenaeus anathematized such groups, insisting they "repent" anoj \nsubmit themselves to him, so he could punish them with "advance \ndiscipline" that would save their souls. 9 \n\nGnostic principles of enlightenment were incorporated into bardic \nromance, mystery plays, and fairy tales early in the medieval period. \nSuch sources maintained secrets of the heretical religions as allegories i \n\n\n\n344 \n\n\n\nIbolic drama. Manichean Gnostics founded their own churches, Gnosticism \n\nSeparating themselves from Rome which they regarded as hopelessly \n\n[materialistic. They claimed the God of the Roman church was really __^^^_^^^_ \n\nla devilish demiurge who made the material world to entrap human souls m ^^ m ^ m ^^ m ^ m \nBin evil. 10 See Manicheans. \n\nGnostic traditions evolved the Catharan Christianity of southern \nprance and Italy, which stimulated the bloody Albigensian crusade \npee Crusades). Catharan churches claimed Jesus transmitted to them a \n[secret Gnostic doctrine that overrode the dogmas of the Roman \njchurch. Only the "inner man" would rise to heaven, so the dogma of \nihe resurrection of the flesh was a lie. Baptism was useless. Marriage \nkvas unimportant. No one needed to be celibate except the "perfected" \n[ones, who renounced the life of the senses as eastern yogis did. The \n[inquisition accused the Cathari of calling the Roman church names, \nbuch as Mother of Fornication, Babylon the Great Whore, the \nDevil\'s Basilica, and Satan\'s Synagogue. \n\nThe story of John the weaver of Toulouse shows opposition \nbetween the Roman church and Catharan principles of ritual purity. \nKccused of following the Gnostic heresy, John proclaimed that he lied, \npwore, ate meat, and enjoyed sex with his wife; therefore he proved \nnimself a faithful Christian and no Catharan heretic. 11 \n\nOther strands of Gnosticism ran through astrology, alchemy, \nHermetic magic, and occultism. Insofar as the sought-after knowl- \nedge was the natural science that alchemists and sorcerers were \nbeginning to discover (or rediscover), the church opposed it as \ndestructive to the faith. St. Augustine had firmly censured "the vain and \ncurious desire of investigation, known as knowledge and science." \nfret Hermes Trismegistus, the half-acknowledged god of medieval \nalchemists and occultists, had been praised by Lactantius as the \njevealer of "almost the whole verity." Women were involved, too, in \n:he pursuit of natural science. Women were closely associated with \nhe origins of alchemical/mystical gnosis: Theosebia, Mary the Jewess, \nme who called herself Cleopatra, another who called herself Isis. 12 \n\nRediscovery of pagan writings had brought Isis back into an \nnfluential, if secret, prominence. The Hellenistic world identified \n\'Isis of the Myriad Names" with every other female divinity. 13 Medi- \neval occultists in turn found her glorified in the writings of Plutarch \nind identified her with the World Soul, or Sophia. She appeared in \nlumerous occult books as the Naked Goddess crowned with stars, \nler dominion over land and sea symbolized by her right foot on the \n;arth, her left foot in water. Her vulva was marked by a precisely \nX)sitioned crescent moon, which a modern male scholar, with the \nairiously typical vague perception of female genitalia, chose to \nlescribe as covering her "womb." H \n\nOn the whole it was a general rule that wherever the orthodox \nlurches found any hint of female divinity or authority, there they at \nMice found heresy. Persecution of various kinds of Gnostics proved the \nle over and over. Both natural science and feminine spirituality \n\n345 \n\n\n\nGoddess came to birth only with great difficulty, against every obstacle that \n\nwestern patriarchism could devise to throw against them.

Seligmann, 45. \n\n\n\nGoddess \n\nFew words are so revealing of western sexual prejudice as the word \nGoddess, in contrast to the word God. Modern connotations vastly \ndiffer from those of the ancients, to whom the Goddess was a full- \nfledged cosmic parent figure who created the universe and its laws, ruler \nof Nature, Fate, Time, Eternity, Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Love, \nBirth, Death, etc. \n\nMale writers through the centuries broke the Goddess figure down,\' \ninto innumerable "goddesses," using different titles or names she \nreceived from different peoples at different times. If such a system had \nbeen applied to the usual concept of God, there would now be a \nmultitude of separate "gods" with names like Almighty, Yahweh, Lord, \nHoly Ghost, Sun of Righteousness, Christ, Creator, Lawgiver, Jeho- \nvah, Providence, Allah, Savior, Redeemer, Paraclete, Heavenly Father, \nand so on, ad infinitum, each one assigned a particular function in the j \nworld pantheon. During the Middle Ages, most of the old names and i \ntitles of male deities were amalgamated as "secret names" of the one \nGod, while the names and titles of the Goddess were ever more \nminutely classified, and some were even masculinized, humanized, \nor diabolized. Yet such classification tends to disintegrate under deeper \nstudy that reveals the same archetypal characteristics in nearly all the \n"goddesses." \n\nProbing ancient views of the Goddess is instructive. It shows a \nfemale figure almost always more powerful than the male. Not only is \\ \nshe his Mother, the author of his being; she is also the deity who infuses \nall creation with the vital blood of life. Gods prosper only when they \npartake of her wisdom or adopt her powers, until they commit the \nultimate hubris, symbolic matricide, by setting up an all-masculine \ntheology. The strength of the Goddess was harnessed to support new \nmale religions as the strength of women\'s nurturing, caretaking \ninstinct was harnessed to a patriarchal marriage system supporting men. \nEven today, scholars tend to call all ancient deities "gods" when they \ninclude both male and female; and sometimes the oracular utterances of: \nthe Goddess are said to emanate from a "god." l \n\nPerhaps one should take more seriously the ancients\' often- \nrepeated opinion that their Goddess had a thousand names. Every \nfemale divinity in the present Encyclopedia may be correctly regarded \nas only another aspect of the core concept of a female Supreme \nBeing. No modern temples perpetuate this core concept. Men long \n\n\n\n346 \n\n\n\nsince tore down the Goddess\'s shrines, as Christian Gospels com- Godiva, Lady \n\nmanded them to do (Acts 19:27). Yet even in a society that trivialized \n\nand vilified it, the core concept lives on. Some people believe that a ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nnew feminine theology will emerge from the core concept during the \n\npresent century. \n\nl.Pritchard.A.N.E. 1,285; 2, 185. \n\n\n\nGodiva, Lady \n\nThe name of Lady Godiva is simply a combination of three different \nways of saying "Goddess." As Mother Goda, or Gerd, she was the same \nas Freya, consort of Godan (Wotan), father of "Gods"(Goths); the \nold Teutonic d and th were interchangeable. 1 Diva was a universal \nIndo-European word for "Goddess" derived from Sanskrit devi. \nTantric scriptures still speak of a "mother of creation" and a "holy \nfemale river" Godavari, personifying the Western Continent, Apara- \nGodaniya, a land of cattle and of rough barbarians who lived on meat \napparently the Goths. 2 \n\nThe legend of Lady Godiva\'s naked ride through Coventry \nevolved from the Goddess\'s May-Eve procession, which the clergy \nfirst tried to suppress by ordering the people to stay indoors and refrain \nfrom watching it. In Southam there were two Ladies, white and \nblack, representing the Virgin and Crone, summer and winter, Love \nand Death. 3 The black Goddess appeared with a bull-masked dancer \nknown as Old Brazen Face: the solar bull mated to the Moon-cow. 4 \nThe "fine lady" on the white horse in the Ride A Cock-Horse \nnursery rhyme was the Naked Goddess of the annual pageant. 5 Some \nIversions of the rhyme called her the "old woman." 6 \n\nPeeping Tom dared to catch a glimpse of her nakedness and was \n[stricken blind for it, according to the story. This recalls other men \nblinded for looking on the Goddess\'s nakedness, like Teiresias of \niThebes. Such divine punishment, with its accompanying gift of \nIgodlike insight, represented a modification of older Gothic customs \n[whereby the Naked Goddess could be seen only by "men doomed to \ndie," such as Teiresias\'s less fortunate forerunner, Actaeon. 7 Blindness \nIwas a common enough result of peeping at forbidden sacred myster- \nlies. King Philip of Macedon was blinded for peeping through a crack to \npee the serpent-god impregnating the queen with the seed of Alexan- \nder the Great. 8 Perhaps Godiva\'s "Tom" was intended to be Thomas \nRhymer, another seer like Teiresias who spent seven years serving \nthe Goddess. \n\nLady Godiva\'s annual ride was suppressed by Puritans, but after \nthe fall of the Puritan Commonwealth in 1678 she appeared again, \nnaked as before on her white horse. So she remained up to 1826, when \nnew wave of puritanism finally dictated that she must be clothed. 9 \n\nThe original purpose of her ride, to renew her virginity, consum- \nmate the sacred marriage, and thus provide the blessings of fertility \n\n\n\n347 \n\n\n\nCog for the coming year, was at last forgotten. An improbable fable was \n\nGolden Rule made up, saying a human Lady of Coventry rode naked alone, only \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m because her Lord insisted on it. This is all most people now know of the \nhistory of Godiva, the Gothic Goddess. \n\n1 . Turville-Petre, 72, 177. 2. Mahanirvanatantra, 67; Tatz & Kent, 85. \n\n3. Graves, W.G., 451. 4.

The Tantric Sadhaka \nor Sadhu (yogi) was told to "do good to other beings as if they were his \nown self." \' Tantric holy men reached the Middle East at an early \ndate, and may have been the "Sadducees" mentioned in the New \nTestament. The Buddhist version of the precept was "What ye sow, \nthat shall ye reap," which was copied into Christian scriptures (Galatians \n6:7) some 500 years later. 2 \n\nLong before the Bible, Akkadian maxims enjoined the faithful: \n"Do not return evil to your adversary; requite with kindness the one \nwho does evil to you ... be friendly to your enemy." 3 In the Egyptian \nMiddle Kingdom, the Golden Rule was a proverb sacred to Maat, the \nMother of Justice; "Do the other good, that he may do good to you." 4 \nAmong the Greeks, the same karmic law became the law of the \nGoddess Dike, ruler of Fate, who said, "He who does wrong to another, \ndoes wrong to himself." 5 Jewish writers adopted the principle and \nattributed it to the injunctions of Hillel: "Do not unto others what thou \n\n\n\n348 \n\n\n\nwouldst not they should do unto you, this is the whole of the Law." 6 Goose \n\nPatriarchal writers naturally attributed the Rule to male heroes, but Gorgon \n\nthe older sources nearly always presented it as the law of the Goddess. ^^____^__ \n\n1.

She laid the Golden Egg of the \nsun, another way of saying she gave birth to Ra. His solar disc was \nsometimes called the Goose-egg. 1 Some Egyptian writings called the \ngoose Creatress of the World because she produced the whole \nuniverse in a primordial World Egg. 2 \n\nThe fairy tale of Jack who climbed the beanstalk to find the goose \nthat laid the golden egg, dated back to pre-dynastic shamans who \nclimbed the Heavenly Vine, or Ladder of Set, to the celestial realm of \nthe solar deity, invoked in prayers as "the Egg of the Goose \nappearing from out of the sycamore." 3 \n\nLike Hathor, Mother Goose was the godmother of all children. In \nher pictures she always wore the traditional garb of the witch- \nmidwife: black cloak, pointed hat like the Egyptian crown, and magic \nwand. \n\n1. de Lys, 27. 2. Neumann, CM., 217. 3.

Gorgo, Gorgon, or Gorgopis, \n"Grim Face," was the title of Athene as a death goddess. 1 Athenians \ntried to explain the Gorgon face on Athene\'s aegis with the myth that \nPerseus cut off Medusa\'s head and brought it home to his own \nGoddess. But this was a late myth designed to conceal Athene\'s roots in \nLibya, where she was herself called Medusa, or Metis. \n\nLike other versions of the archaic Goddess, the Gorgons were a \ntrinity in classical mythology. Their names were Medusa, Stheino, \nand Euryale: Wisdom, Strength, and Universality. Hellenic writers \npretended they were monsters, but these were not the names of \nmonsters. They were titles of the triadic Moon Mother. Orphic mystics \ncontinued to call the moon "The Gorgon\'s Head." 2 \n\nThe story that the Gorgon\'s look could turn men to stone dated \nfrom the use of the Gorgon-face to enforce taboos on secret Myster- \nies of the Goddess, guarded by stone pillars formerly erected in honor of \nher deceased lovers.

The \noriginal word was godsib, "one related to the gods," i.e., a god-mother. \nIn pre-Christian times, elder women were considered divine because \nthey retained their "wise blood" after menopause. (See Menstrual \nBlood.) \n\nIn Christian times, "gossip" came to mean any godmother; e.g. \nQueen Elizabeth I was the gossip at the baptism of her godson James \nVI of Scotland. 1 \n\nA group of elder women were called "gossips" as a term of respect \nat first, after the peasant habit of calling any older woman "mother" \nor "grandmother." The modern meaning of "gossip" arose from the \nconversation of "gossips," or old wives\' tales. \n\n1. Funk, 256. \n\n\n\nGotterdammerung \n\n"Going-into-the-Shadow-of-the-Gods," often erroneously called \nTwilight of the Gods: the Teutonic doomsday, when all the old gods \nwould be destroyed and reabsorbed by the Great Goddess Skadi, the \nShadow. 1 Like Kali in the Far East, Skadi stood for the primal womb of \ndarkness that cyclically devoured worlds and gave them new birth. \nThe Scandinavian and Teutonic concept of cyclic universes, each with \nits renewable set of gods, was essentially identical to that of India. See \nDoomsday. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 164. \n\n\n\nGrace \n\nIn a famous New Testament passage, the quality said to be greater \nthan faith or hope is caritas(\\ Corinthians 13), translated sometimes \n"charity," sometimes "love." Both translations are inexact. The word \nmeant "grace," specifically the grace of the Triple Goddess, embodied \nin the boon-bestowing Three Graces who dispensed caritas (Latin) or \ncharis (Greek) and were called the Charites. Julian said their grace was a \ngift from heaven: "The threefold gift of the Charites comes to us \nfrom heaven, from the circles of the stars." l \n\nRomans sometimes called grace venia, the divine correlative of \nVenus, bringing visible tokens of the goddess\'s favor. 2 Grace meant \nthe same as Sanskrit karuna, dispensed by the heavenly nymphs and \ntheir earthly copies, the sacred harlots of Hindu temples (devadasis). \nTheir "grace" was a combination of beauty, kindness, mother-love, \ntenderness, sensual delight, compassion, and care. \n\nGraces were emanations of the Goddess. They danced in her \nshrines. They tended to her adornment. They acted as midwives to \nthe gods. They were patrons of music, dance, poetry, and art. 3 They \nwere shown over and over in the same classic pose as three naked \n\n\n\n350 \n\n\n\nwomen dancing, in attitudes strongly resembling those of the Heavenly Graeae \n\nNymphs on the Temple of Love at Khajuraho in India. 4 Grail, Holy \n\nGreek writers called the Graces Aglaia (Brilliant), Thalia (Flower- \n\nBringer), and Euphrosyne (Heart\'s Joy); but they had older names \ninherited from a dim prehistory. Homer knew only one Grace, named \nCale or Kale, perhaps a cognate of Kali. 5 The Gnostic author Marcus \nalso used the word Grace or Charis as a title of the Goddess: "May She \nwho is before all things, the incomprehensible and indescribable \nGrace, fill you within, and increase in you her own knowledge." 6 \n\nChristians took the pagan concept of charis and struggled to divest \nit of sexual meanings for application to an ascetic creed. "Charity" \nbecame a basic tenet of primitive Christianity, as of Buddhism before it, \non the theory that a sure place in heaven could be won by giving \naway one\'s worldly goods to the poor. Jesus listed the blessings prepared \nfor those who voluntarily made themselves meek, humble, and poor \non earth (Luke 6:20-30). The church\'s word for these "Beatitudes" was \nmacarisma, a word of ancient origin, invoking the Triple Goddess as \nMa (birth), Charis (grace), and Ma (death). 7 The cognate word charis- \nma meant Mother-given grace. \n\nCharis merged with "charity" via ancient precedents equating love \nand affection with hospitality and gift-giving, the "maternal virtues." \nHomeric literature used the word philein, "lovingness," to mean open- \nhanded hospitality. 8 As re-interpreted by Christian theology, the \n"graciousness" that used to mean both liberality and warm physical \naffection came to suggest liberality alone, practiced to secure one\'s \nown immortality. \n\n1.

According to the Perseus myth they were less \nterrible than the Gorgons, but Graeae and Gorgons were originally the \nsame triad, the former having more sinister names than the latter. \nThe Graeae were named Enyo, Pemphredo, and Deino: Warlike One, \nWasp, and Terror. 1 They shared but a single eye and a single tooth \namong them, showing that they stood for a primitive concept of the \nGoddess who was three in one and one in three. See Gorgon; \nTrinity. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,129. \n\n\n\nGrail, Holy \n\nChristian myth said the Holy Grail was the chalice used by Christ at \nthe Last Supper when he poured wine for the disciples to drink, saying, \n\n\n\n351 \n\n\n\nGrail, Holy "this is my blood" (Matthew 26:28). After the crucifixion, Joseph of \n\nArimathea took the chalice to England and established it in a shrine at \n^^^^^M^^M^Hi Glastonbury. Later, it disappeared. \n\nThis myth wasn\'t heard in Europe until the 1 2th century. The real \norigins of the Holy Grail were not Christian but pagan. The Grail \nwas first Christianized in Spain from a sacred tradition of the Moors. 1 \nLike the Celts\' holy Cauldron of Regeneration, which it resembled, \nthe blood-filled vessel was a womb symbol meaning rebirth in the \nOriental or Gnostic sense of reincarnation. Its connotation was \nfeminine, not masculine. \n\nThe Grail was kept in a magnificent temple governed by a queen \nnamed Repanse de Joie (Dispenser of Joy), an ancient title of a holy \nharlot. Bards said her husband was a Moor, and her son John founded \nthe eastern order of the Knights Templar, a group of warriors \ndedicated to the Grail temple and the defense of women. When a lady \nneeded help, Grail knights like Galahad, Parsifal, or Lohengrin \nwould receive orders in fiery letters on the rim of the Grail and ride to \nthe rescue. \n\nHispano-Moorish tradition located the Grail temple on Montsal- \nvatch, the "Mount of Salvation" in the Spanish Pyrenees. 2 The \ntemple was a model of the universe, topped by a gigantic ruby \nrepresenting the maternal heart of the world, the Holy Rose. The \npseudo-universe even included a miniature of itself enclosing the sacred \nvessel: \n\nThe temple itself was one hundred fathoms in diameter. Around it were \nseventy-two chapels of an octagonal shape. To every pair of chapels \nthere was a tower six stories high, approachable by a winding stair on the \noutside. . . . The vaulting was of blue sapphire, and in the center was a \nplate of emerald. . . . All the altar stones were of sapphire. . . . Upon the \ninside of the cupola surmounting the temple, the sun and moon were \nrepresented in diamonds and topazes, and shed a light as of day even in \nthe darkness of the night. The windows were of crystal, beryl, and other \ntransparent stones. The floor was of translucent crystal, under which all \nthe fishes of the sea were carved out of onyx, just like life. The towers \nwere of precious stones inlaid with gold; their roofs of gold and blue \nenamel. Upon every tower there was a crystal cross, and upon it a \ngolden eagle with expanded wings, which, at a distance, appeared to be \nflying. At the summit of the main tower was an immense carbuncle, \nwhich served, like a star, to guide the Templars thither at night. In the \ncenter of the building, under the dome, was a miniature representation \nof the whole, and in this the holy vessel was kept. \' \n\nLike the Arabian brotherhood oihashishim (see Aladdin), the \nlegendary Knights Templar waited for the Desired Knight, or Mahdi, to \nrescue the world from tyranny and establish the benevolent rule of \nthe Grail. The alternative was a dire prediction of the Waste Land, \nmodeled on the arid wilderness of Arabia Deserta, which some \neastern sages attributed to the departure of the Goddess. \n\nThe Grail temple was sometimes called Montjoie, "Mount of \n\n\n\n352 \n\n\n\nM \n\n\n\nJoy," like the castle Joyous Gard to which Queen Guinevere retired Grail, Holy \n\nwith her lover. It was the same as the Mons Veneris, or Venusberg. Its \n\nsexual symbolism served to rally heretical uprisings against the anti- ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsexual church. A 14th-century peasant leader calling himself William \n\nKarle, or Cale, adopted "Montjoie" as a battle cry, and banners \n\nshowing the Goddess\'s traditional triple lily. 4 The same battle cry was \n\nused by the legendary soldiers of Roland, supposed to have died in \n\nthe vicinity of the Grail castle. 5 Even older myths said the battle cry of \n\nthe Grail king was Amor (Love). 6 \n\nThe Grail was first converted into the chalice of Christ\'s last \nsupper in the Joseph d\'Arimathie of the Burgundian poet Robert de \nBorron, between 1 180 and 1 199. The origins of the mystic vessel were \nyet suspect. It was formerly a jewel in the devil\'s crown. Sixty \nthousand angels gave it to Satan when he still lived in heaven. During \nhis descent to hell, the jewel fell from his crown to earth, where it was \nfound and fashioned into a cup. 7 Joseph of Arimathea acquired the cup \nland gave it to Jesus to use at his last meal with his disciples. It was the \njcup of doom, of which Jesus prayed to God in a weak moment, \n"Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me" (Matthew \n26:39). \n\nThe poet said Joseph was imprisoned by the Jews and left in a \njdungeon for a year and a day without food or drink; but he remained \nalive and well because he had the Grail with him. He was set free by the \nemperor Vespasian, who was converted to Christianity after being \ncured of leprosy by the veil with which St. Veronica wiped Jesus\'s face. \nJoseph then traveled to England with a group of pilgrims, built the \ntemple of the Grail at Glastonbury, and installed the Round Table for \n(the rite of the holy supper. Among his followers was Bron, the Rich \n[Fisher, directly stolen from pagan myths of Bran the Blessed, Welsh \ngod of the sacred cauldron. For a touch of anti-Semitic propaganda in \nthis chowder of fantasy, de Borron claimed the vacant Seat Perilous at \nthe Round Table was the seat of Judas. Another Jew, Moyses \n;(Moses) once dared to sit in it, but for his hubris he was swallowed up by \nthe earth. 8 \n\nAbout 1230 appeared the even more chaotic Vulgate Cycle, \njL\'Estoire de] Saint Graal, a quintet of prose romances in Old French. \nThe author pretended his book was given by the ghost of Christ himself \nto a Cistercian monk on Good Friday, 717 a.d. This work frankly \ncalled the Grail by its old title, an escuele or "cauldron." The company \nDf the Grail colonized the holy city of Sarras, ruled by Mordrain and \nNascien (Death and Birth). Moys (Moses) was snatched away from the \nSeat Perilous by fiery hands. Solomon\'s ship, which moved by itself \npn the sea, carried Christianity to all lands. Members of the Grail \nbompany had various adventures: Bron went to Scotland and sus- \nained a poisoned wound, like Tristan. He was cured by the local \nirincess, then he killed her father and married her. Alain the \nj \'Hunting Dog" went to a foreign land and built a new castle for the \ni Srail, Castle Corbenic (cors-benoiz, meaning either Horn of Plenty \n\n\n\n353 \n\n\n\nGreen, Wearing of or Sacred Heart). The seventh Rich Fisher, Lambor, was slain by a \n\nSaracen with the magic sword from Solomon\'s ship, and the land of \nwm mm mm ^^^ m m m the lost Grail became la terregaste the Waste Land. 9 \n\nA final step in the transformation of the Grail from a pagan symbol \nto a Christian one was taken in La Queste del Saint Graal, written by \na Cistercian monk. Now Galahad was said to be the perfect Desired \nKnight, of the lineage of Joseph of Arimathea. Galahad occupied the \nSeat Perilous safely, because he was virginally pure. He drew the magic \nsword from a stone that floated on the river, for the same reason. \nThrough him the Grail vision was bestowed on all the Round Table \nknights, who promptly left their games, feasts, and tourneys (i.e., their \npaganism) to follow the vision to the ends of the earth in search of the \nreal thing. \n\nThe Queste showed obvious hostility to the contemporary cult of \ncourtly love; but when the Grail\'s aura of feminine mystery was \nremoved, its romantic appeal declined. If the Grail was nothing more \nthan the cup of Christ\'s blood, then there was no reason for the great \nQuest at all. The cup of Christ\'s blood was readily available to all, in \nevery chapel; and even though it was called a holy sacrament, its \ndiscovery somehow lacked thrills. 10 As matters turned out, to Christian- \nize the Grail was to neutralize the magnetism of its secret nature. \n\nThe monkish author\'s real purpose was to tout the virtues of \nvirginity. All but one of the Round Table knights failed the Grail \nquest because they were guilty of sexual sins. Perceval was abandoned \nbecause of his past links with the cult of courtly love. Gawain, who \nplayed the part of Desired Knight in other romances, failed utterly. \nLancelot, having committed adultery with Guinevere, could never \nsee the Grail except in a dream. The only chaste knight was Galahad, \nthe new, purified Lancelot. Galahad\'s virginity led him to every \nChristian treasure, including the shield of Joseph of Arimathea, laid up \nin a Cistercian abbey. It was white with a red cross the same "hues \nof innocence and blood" on the red-and-white emblem of the Assassins\' \nbrotherhood, borrowed by the crusaders, and later by mystics calling \nthemselves Knights of the Rosy Cross, or Rosicrucians. 11 \n\nThe Grail remained secretly pagan for many centuries in isolated \nareas.

By imitative magic, wearing of \n\n354 \n\n\n\ngreen was supposed to encourage Mother Earth to clothe herself in Grim \n\nthe green of abundant crops. The women described as fairies in Grotesques \n\nmedieval balladry always dressed in green; and their lovers, like ^^_^_^_^_ \n\nThomas Rhymer, wore green in the fairy realm. Christians opposed \nthese pagan traditions, associating green with the dead and with \nwitches, developing the "familiar superstition that green is unlucky." 1 \nGreen was also linked with the sexual promiscuity of old rituals. \n\nl.Wimberly, 176. \n\n\n\nGrim \n\n"Mask," often a title of Teutonic deities, like Grimhild. Northern \ngods as well as those of Egypt and Africa were thought to reside in the \nmasks worn by their impersonators at religious pageants. 1 "Grim" \ncame to mean "ominous" because mask-wearing priests and priestesses \nwere traditional givers of omens. \n\n1 . Sturluson, 49. \n\n\n\nGriselda \n\nLegendary model for proper wifely behavior in the Christian era. \n"Patient Griselda" married a man of superior rank, who abused her, \nneglected her, flaunted his adulteries before her, even took away her \nbabies to kill them and forbade her to shed a single tear because the sight \nof her grief would vex him. Griselda endured everything humbly, \nand at last her husband reformed and rewarded her with his true love, \nsaying she had passed all his "tests." So they lived happily ever after, \nGriselda apparently harboring no resentment for years of mistreatment. \n\n\n\nGrotesques \n\n"Creatures of the Grotto," decorative figures in Christian churches, \ntaken from the animal gods, masques, sirens, gorgons, satyrs, Green \nMen, serpent deities, and other idols in the sacred caves of pagan- \nism. 1 Early churches were built right over the heathen "grotto" and the \nsame deities were worshipped side by side with Christian ones, so the \npeople would continue to come to the church by force of habit, finding \ntheir familiar idols there. 2 Some hardly noticed the change, which \nwas what authorities of the church counted on. Pope Gregory the Great \nordered missionaries to "accommodate the ceremonies of the Chris- \ntian worship as much as possible to those of the heathen, that the people \nmay not be much startled at the change." 3 \n\nLater, when "grotesques" were re-defined as devils, churches were \nleft with incongruous images of the rival deities, to which people still \nprayed secretly, or touched for "luck," or gave offerings. Hugo wrote, \n"Sometimes a porch, a facade, or a whole church presents a symbolic \nmeaning entirely foreign to worship, even inimical to the Church." 4 \n\n\n\n355 \n\n\n\nGrove, Sacred \n\n\n\nA common Indo- \nEuropean word for the \nsacred grove was \nNemi (Latin nemus), \nindicating dedication \nto the Moon-goddess \ncalled Nemesis, \nDiana Nemorensis, or \nDiana Nemetona \nLady of the Grove. \nNemeton was the \ndruidic oak grove. \nStrabo said the \ngreatest shrine of the \nGalatians (Gauls) in \nAsia Minor was \nDrunemeton, the \ndruid-grove. Southern \nScotland had a shrine \ncalled Medionemeton. \nFrance had another, \ncalled Nemetodorum \n(modern Nanterre). \nIn Spain, the sacred \ngrove of the Moon- \ngoddess Brigit was \nNemetobriga. 1 \nHungary still has \nMaros-Nemeti, an \nold grove-shrine of \nMari-Diana. 2 \n\nThe Irish called a \nsanctuary nemed, or \nfidnemed, a "forest \nshrine," established \nby the archaic colonists \ncalled Nemed or \nMoon-people. \nReligious rites \ncontinued in these \nforest shrines \nthroughout the Middle \nAges. 5 Christian \nwriters spoke of \n"heathen \n\nabominations" carried \nout in forest shrines \nor nimidae. \n\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Worms for example displayed along one whole side \nthe gods and heroes of the Nibelungenlied, even though the official \ntheology represented these entities as devils. 5 \n\nSometimes the traditions of the grotesques were perpetuated by \nsecret societies among the artisans, especially masons and smiths, \nwhose fraternities preserved Gnostic symbols like the double-tailed \nsiren, the double-sexed demiurge, and the Ouroboros or World \nSerpent, also greatly revered by alchemists and Hermetic magicians.

A large tree, pillar, or obelisk \nwithin the grove often represented the male god inside the Goddess as \nboth child and lover. \n\nBrittany in the 1 1th century still had a druidic holy wood called \nNemet. This may have been the same as the fairy wood Broceliande, \nthe grove of Merlin\'s Nemesis, the lady Nimue, who also bore the name \nof the fatal Goddess of the grove. \n\nPatriarchal priesthoods seemed to consider the groves dangerous. \nThe Bible speaks of many attacks on the asherim or Groves of \nAsherah, which were consistently worshipped by both people and kings, \ndespite the prophets\' repeated condemnations: Exodus 34:13, Deu- \nteronomy 16:21, Judges 3:7, 1 Kings 15:13, 16:33; 2 Kings 18:4, 21:7. \n\nDestroyers of the sacred groves feared the Mother\'s curse, as \nshown in numerous moralizing myths. Erysichthon dared to cut \ndown one of Demeter\'s sacred groves, though the high priestess forbade \nhim with the voice of the Goddess herself. Then angry Demeter \ncursed him with perpetual hunger that could never be appeased. He \nended as a wretched beggar, frantically stuffing his mouth with filth. 4 \n\nDruidic sacred groves were somewhat protected by superstitious \nfear of similar curses. The oak grove at Derry was one of the most \npopular shrines of Irish paganism, its magical name still invoked by the \nbardic phrase "Hey, Derry Down" in the chorus of old ballads. \nWritings attributed to St. Columba said Derry\'s grove must be pre- \nserved at all costs. The saint said as much as he feared death and hell, \nhe "dreaded still more the sound of an axe in the grove of Derry." 5 \n\nSacred kings in Diana\'s ancient grove at Nemi were expected to \nfight any rival challenger who broke a branch from the holy tree. This \nsymbolic act occurs so often in medieval romances that it can only be \nassumed the custom continued through the Middle Ages. The \nVulgate epic of Lancelot said Parsifal challenged a rival knight in the \nsame manner as the heroes of Nemi: he "found a tree in the grove \n\n\n\n356 \n\n\n\nundefended, and broke a branch from it." 6 Evidence is not lacking to Guignole, Saint \n\nshow that breaking a branch from the sacred tree was equivalent to a Guinevere \n\nthreat of castration of the god, or the incumbent sacred king who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nembodied the god. 7 \n\n1.

Even after adoption \ninto the Christian canon, St. Guignole remained an ithyphallic \nfigure, from whose erect penis women scraped splinters to assist in \nconception charms. The priests assisted by installing a trick penis in \nSt. Guignole\'s statue, which could be lengthened secretly from behind \nas it was scraped away in front. 1 See Phallus Worship. \nl.G.R. Scott, 247. \n\n\n\nGuinevere \n\nIn Germany, Guinevere was Cunneware, "female wisdom." \' Accord- \ning to the Welsh Triads, she was the Triple Goddess, Gwenhwyfar, \n"the first lady of these islands," at times one queen, at times three \nqueens, all named Gwenhwyfar, all of whom married King Arthur. 2 \n\nArthur was born of the same Goddess when he was cast ashore on \nthe ninth wave. The Welsh called breaking waves the Sheep of the \nMermaid, and the Mermaid was Gwenhidwy, or Gwenhwyfar. The \nninth wave represented the "god born of nine maidens," also known \nas The Ram. 3 Nine maidens signified the triplicated Triple Goddess, \nlike the nine Muses in Greek myth. \n\nGuinevere embodied the sovereignty of Britain. No king could \nreign without her. Thus, in story after story, she was abducted by \nwould-be rulers. Melwas, Meleagant, Arthur, Lancelot, and Mordred \nall took Guinevere away from the incumbent ruler when they wished \nto make themselves kings. When a king lost Guinevere, he lost the \nkingship. Some myths suggest that she was a sacred statue, like the \nFortuna Regia of Roman Caesars. 4 Yet she was also a living woman, \nwho impersonated the Destroyer when she gave the apple of death to \nPatrick, and was nearly burned at the stake when she was accused of \nwitchcraft. Early legends said she disappeared into the castle of \nJoyous Gard, the earthly paradise, where she reigned each spring as \nMay Queen. \n\n1 . Campbell, CM., 448. 2. Malory 1 , xxiv. 3.

She also ruled fate, as shown by the plural form Guises, the \nFates Who Write, corresponding to Roman Fata Scribunda, or \nTeutonic Schreiberinnen, "Writing- Women." * \n\nl.Gaster ( 764. \n\n\n\nMahabharata Indian \nepic poem, consisting \nof historical and \nlegendary material \ngathered between the \n4th and 10th centuries \nA.p, including the \nfamous Bhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\nGunas \n\n"Strands," the threads of Fate, colored white, red, and black. In \nTantric symbolism, the three colors stood for "the divine female \nPrakriti" i.e., Kali in her three aspects as Creator, Preserver, and \nDestroyer, or giver of birth, life, and death. 1 The Virgin-Creator was \nSattva, white; the Mother-Preserver was Rajas, red; the Crone- \nDestroyer was Tamas, black. Together they symbolized the cyclic \nsuccession of "purity, passion, darkness." 2 \n\nThe Svetasvatara Upanishad said white, red, and black were the \ncolors of the Goddess Maya, who was also Kali. Sattva signified \n"radiant tranquility"; from sat, that which exists forever. 3 Rajas was the \ncolor of royal blood, the color of a king {raj), and of the Mother as \nqueen and battle-goddess, like Durga-Kali, in "blazing motion, violence \nand passion." Another of her names, Aruna, may have been the \norigin of Arum, the Mesopotamian Goddess who made mankind out of \nclay reddened with her lunar blood. 4 Tamas, the color of the Crone, \nstood for "passive weight and darkness," the blackness of the tomb. 5 \n\nThe Gunas were not only Oriental. The same white, red, and \nblack "strands" were associated with western forms of the Triple \nGoddess also. Theocritus, Ovid, Tibullus, and Horace all said the sacred \ncolors of the life-threads were white, red, and black. 6 The Goddesses \nwho held the threads were the Fates. They were based on Oriental \nimages such as the three Goddesses depicted in the Mahabharata, \nweaving the veil of nights and days in an underground "city of \nserpents," representing cycles of light and darkness with threads of \nwhite and black linked with the blood-red thread of life. 7 \n\nSumerian temples were ornamented with clay-cone mosaics that \nalways showed the same three colors, 8 which were also used to \ndecorate the New World pottery known as Mimbres ware. Celtic myth \nassigned them to the Hounds of Annwn or dogs of the underworld, \nand to the maidens in the Castle of the Holy Grail, as if they too were \nKalis or, as the Irish said, kelles (see Kelle). \n\nThe Gunas are familiar motifs in fairy tales, such as Snow White: a \nstory of the princess who not only personified the Virgin in combina- \ntion with the Mother-queen and the Crone-witch; she also displayed the \nGunas in her own person, with "skin white as snow, lips red as blood, | \nand hair black as ebony." Snow White was a direct descendant of \nPeredur\'s divine lady-love, whose hair was black as jet, her skin white \nand red. A vision of the colors alone (crow\'s feathers and blood in the \n\n\n\n358 \n\n\n\nsnow) cast Peredur into a holy trance of meditation upon her image, Gunnlod \n\nfrom which he couldn\'t wake. 9 Grimm\'s fairy tale of Snow White and Gwyn \n\nRose Red came from the same root, uniting Virgin and Mother as ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nEithne the Fair and Fedelim the Rosy, repeated in the lilies and roses \nsacred to the virgin Mary. 10 The same Virgin and Mother colors \nwere combined by the Two Mistresses of ancient Egypt, Nekhbet and \nButo, wearers of the white and red crowns. The same colors were \nknown to medieval mystics in the Middle East as the Hues of Inno- \ncence and Blood. 11 \n\nThe Crone\'s color, black, was often dissociated from the Virgin \nand Mother colors, though the three veils laid on Christian altars for \nChristmas Matins retained the hues of the pagan trinity, white, red, and \nblack. 12 Black animals were sacrificed to the underworld Goddess \nfrom Homer\'s time all the way up to the 18th century a.d. 13 The Slavs \noffered black horses to their horse-headed Lord of Death, Volos, who \nwas lightly Christianized as St. Vlas. 14 Gypsy women wore red and \nblack for funerals, combining the attributes of Mother and Crone. 15 \nIn China however, the funereal color was white, to suggest rebirth. Old \nEuropean ballads sometimes associate all three colors with death. \nThe departure of the dead from Middle-Earth was heralded by "the \ncrowing of the white, the red, and the black cock." 1<s \n\nSo often were the sacred colors displayed in hundreds of myths, \nfolk tales, and even Christian customs, that Dante placed them at the \nvery core of his Inferno, to symbolize the essence of God\'s adversary: \nthe three heads of Lucifer were white, red, and black. 17 \n\n1.

He was born of Arianrhod, the Great Goddess as virgin \nnother, and became her consort. Like her, he was a trinity: Dylan, a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n359 \n\n\n\nGyges silver fish; Llew, a white stag; Gwyn, the white rider on a white horse. \n\nGypsies In these forms he matched the trinity of Arianrhod of the silver \n\nmm mm ^^^^^^^^ m wheel, Blodeuwedd the white-flower virgin, and Cerridwen the deathly \nwhite sow.

See \nKingship. \n\n1. Herodotus, 5-6. \n\n\n\nGypsies \n\nAmong the last active preservers of Goddess- worship in Europe were \nthe gypsies, who began to migrate westward from Hindustan about \n1000 a.d. 1 Because Christians identified their beliefs with witchcraft, \ngypsies were popularly known as Minions of the Moon, or Diana\'s \nForesters. Some may have adopted the Dianic witch-cult through \nassimilation of the lunar Diana to their own Goddess, Sara-Kali (Queen \nKali), also called Laki (Hindu Lakshmi), or Matta the Mother. 2 \nGypsies revered the female principle as the source of life; they said, \n"For us, woman is like the earth. The earth is our mother, and so is \nwoman. The secret of life comes from the ground." 3 \n\nMany Europeans thought the gypsies came from Egypt, hence \ntheir name, "Egyptians." 4 Their own traditions, usually kept secret \nfrom non-gypsies, showed that they came of Hindu roots. They be- \nlieved in reincarnation and karma. A gypsy fortune teller or \ncartomancer was called a Vedavica, reader of the Vedas; for gypsies \nseem to have regarded Tarot cards as their own Vedas. 5 \n\nGypsies\' Goddess was a trinity: Kali as the same three sisters of \nFate worshipped by pagans and witches. Like the fairy godmothers, \nMoerae, or Fortunae, she came in the form of three mystic ladies to the \ncradle of every newborn child. Gypsies\' baptismal ceremonies includ- \ned three offerings on the infant\'s bed, "one for each goddess of fate." 6 \n\nThe three divine Mothers were symbolized by a triangle, the \nTantric yogis\' sacred Yoni Yantra, immemorial sign of woman. \n\n\n\n360 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGypsies\' informal hieroglyphic system always represented "woman" by Gypsies \n\nthe Yoni Yantra. 7 A favorite method of card divination among gypsies \n\nwas to lay out cards in this same "female" shape. Like the Triple Goddess \n\nherself, the triangle\'s three sides stood for past, present, and future. 8 \n\nThe matriarch was the center of gypsy tribal life. "Everything that \nwent on around a tribal mother resembled the old pagan sex rites." \nHer husband was a drone, whose function was to impregnate her. The \ntribe supported him in idleness but looked down on him as a non- \nproductive member. If he failed to beget perfect children, he was \n"accidentally" killed, and another stud-chieftain took his place. \n"Tribal mothers were often widowed half a dozen times over." The \nmale functionary closest to a tribal mother was not her husband but \n"the coaxer," a man trained from an early age to control his own sexual \nresponses and "concentrate completely on his partner\'s pleasure. He \nwas taught to know all the sensitive and erotic zones of the female body. \nIn this curious three-sided relationship, the coaxer gave the mother \nher physical fulfillment without ever penetrating her. Instead, by a \ncombination of caresses, words, and breathing, he made her suffi- \nciently excited to be ready to have an orgasm as soon as her husband \ntook over." 9 \n\nThe queen\'s coaxer was trained like a Tantric yogi in the rite of \nmaithuna, and so were other "occult couples" revered by the gypsies \nfor impersonating the Goddess and God in their endless world-sustain- \ning union. For the gypsy, as for the Tantric sadhu and the Sufi \ndervish, occult coitus reservatus was "a means of increasing psychic \npowers" in accordance with the ancient Oriental belief that all magic \ncomes from woman. 10 \n\nThe gypsy word for a fairy, rashani, actually meant "priestess." \nThe most common gypsy surnames were Smith and Faa: "Fay," or \n"Fairy." n Gypsies were generally practitioners of smithcraft, thus \nbecame involved in the medieval conviction that smiths, wizards, and \nwomen conspired together against the Christian church. 12 (See Smith.) \n\nLegends constantly attest to hostility between Christians and \ngypsies. Laws against vagrancy were invoked, or even specifically \npassed, to enable the Inquisition to seize gypsies and haul them off to \nwitches\' prisons, often without even recording their names. 13 In 1 500 \nthe Diet of Augsburg ruled that Christians could kill gypsies without \nlegal penalty, whereas a gypsy injured by a Christian might seek no \nredress in court. 14 In 1782, forty-five gypsies were tortured, broken on \nthe wheel, hanged, drawn, and quartered for having murdered a \nnumber of Hungarians who were really alive and well enough to watch \nthe execution of their alleged killers. 15 \n\nThere was a popular belief that gypsies were descended from a \nunion of the first gypsy woman with the devil. 16 An English writer \ncalled gypsies "thieves, rogues, and beggarly rascals . . . known by the \nname of Bohemians, Egyptians, and Caramaras." 17 The third of \nthese titles was peculiarly reminiscent of Kauri-Mara, or Mother Kali as \nraie Goddess of Death. \n\n\n\n361 \n\n\n\nGypsies As the epithet "Christ-killers" supported persecutions of Jews, so \n\nvarious epithets and legends supported persecutions of gypsies. It was \n^^^^^^^^^^^ said gypsy smiths forged the nails for Christ\'s crucifixion. The gypsies \npromulgated a counter-legend: they said an ancestor of their race \nstole one of the four nails set aside to crucify Jesus, but had no time to \nsteal the other three. For want of the fourth nail, Jesus\'s feet had to \nbe fastened together with a single nail. Oddly, the transition from four \nnails to three in Christian art occurred about the same time the \ngypsies were telling this story. 18 The gypsies also claimed that Jesus, \ngrateful for the gypsy\'s attempt to save him, from the cross granted all \ngypsies the right to steal. Another legend said gypsies were allowed to \nsteal because a gypsy woman stole the infant Jesus and hid him from \nHerod\'s baby-killers in her basket. 19 \n\nSome gypsies said their race had its own special savior, a Son of \nGod named Alako, who ascended to the moon. He defends gypsies \nand takes their souls to the moon after death. His two enemies are the \ndevil and Christ. 20 Gypsies also prayed to a spirit from Mother Earth, \nthe Pchuvus (cognate with Celtic pooka or Puck), who can bestow \n"earth" on favored people. In gypsy terms, earth meant luck, fortune, \nmoney, like the Hindu artha, riches from the Earth-mother. 21 \n\nGypsies claimed it was very unlucky to meet a monk or priest first \nthing in the morning; nothing would go right for the rest of the day. \nThis anti-clerical idea caught on even among Christians and was still \nfound throughout Italy in the 19th century. 22 Agrippa\'s Occult \nPhilosophy said meeting a monk was an evil omen, "because these kind \n[sic] of men live for the most by the sudden death of men, as vultures \ndo by slaughters." 23 Reginald Scot said when hunters met a priest, they \nthought it such bad luck that they would "couple up their hounds, \nand go home, being in despair of any further sport that day." 24 \n\nGypsy myths repeated classical sacred dramas in the guise of fairy \ntales. The Horned God sacrificed to the Triple Goddess appeared \nfrequently. As a gypsy youth, he ate a magic apple given him by a \nwoman, and stag\'s horns grew from his head. He ate a second magic \napple, and his flesh fell away from his bones. He ate a third magic apple, \ncrossed a stream (the Styx), and was resurrected, fairer than ever. 25 \nHere was Dionysus or Actaeon or Pentheus, slain in his stag mask and \nreborn from the dead. \n\nAs in Vedic myth, gypsy gods were often sacrificed in pig form, \nusually with the all-important apple representing the "heart-soul" \n(Egyptian ah). A gypsy maiden reminiscent of Circe was said to have \nresurrected her dead lover by replacing all his flesh with pig\'s flesh, a \nclassic image of a god\'s or man\'s sacrificial bestialization. When she \nsqueezed an apple into his mouth to serve as his new heart, he \nreturned to life. 26 The pig with an apple in its mouth was also known to \nworshippers of Vishnu the boar-god, and those of his Norse counter- \npart the Yuletide boar (or suckling pig). Egyptians said a dead man \ncould be brought back to life when Anubis pushed his heart into his \n\n\n\n362 \n\n\n\nmouth. 27 Gypsies told a similar story of a gypsy witch who brought her Gypsies \n\ndead son to life again by pushing his heart into his mouth. 28 An apple \n\noften represented the heart. ^_^^__^__^_ \n\nAmong gypsies, "giving the heart" in love or marriage frequently \ntook the ceremonial form of giving an apple. "Occult couples" began \nthe sexual rites with formal cutting of the apple to reveal its magic \npentacle, feeding it to each other with the formula: "I am your \nnourishment, you are mine. We are the feast." 29 South Slavic pagans \nalso used the apple in their marriage ritual: the bride ate half the \napple, and gave the other half to her bridegroom. It has been surmised \nthat a similar ancient marriage rite underlay the story of Eve\'s apple. 30 \n\nCertainly the myths that developed into gypsy folk tales were \nextremely old and universal throughout the Indo-European cultures. \nTheir Goddess Sara-Kali could well have been the original Sarah who \ned her tribe from the matrilineal society of Ur of the Chaldees about \n1900 B.C. 31 Her alleged consort Abraham was emphasized by biblical \nwriters, but rabbinic literature said he was only a Chaldean "astrolo- \nger," i.e., a priest of the Moon-Goddess. 32 The Goddess appeared as \nmother of the solar deity in another gypsy legend, as "an old woman \ndressed in white, sitting in a beautiful temple." She explained her \nfunction in terms recalling the Riddle of the Sphinx: "I am the \nbother of the Sun King, who daily flies out of this house as a little child, \nit mid-day becomes a man, and returns of an evening a graybeard." 33 \nShe also represented the divine Cauldron that daily swallowed him up and \njave him rebirth. The popular gypsy surname Kaldera or Kalderas may \nlave been derived from Kali-Devi as the same Cauldron. 34 \n\nThe Cauldron of the Deep also appeared in gypsy lore as a mirror, \nike the one in which the Titans trapped the soul of Dionysus, who \nvas identified with the same sun god. Transylvanian gypsies called him \nme Enchanted (or Accursed) Hunter, who loved a witch named \nMara or Mari that is, Mother Death. She trapped the hunter\'s soul in \nper magic mirror and took it away from him, the typical preliminary \ni:o his cyclic resurrection. 35 \n\nMuch of this highly significant gypsy lore was kept from non- \njypsies for many centuries, as it was always viewed as heresy by \nChristian authorities, and even folk tales could become excuses for \njersecution. The prejudice against gypsies has lasted even into the \n>resent century. The Nazis declared them "subhumans," along with \news, Slavs, and other "non-Aryans."

His Greek name, Aidon- \neus, meant "blind one," a common title of the phallic Hidden God in \nthe womb of the earth. 2 \n\nHades was also known as Pluto, or Pluton, Lord of Riches. He was \nsupposed to know the location of all gems and precious metals in the \nearth. When he was identified with the Christian devil, the belief \npersisted that the devil could locate buried treasure for his followers. \nLike all underground deities, Hades was thought a leading resident of \nhell, which was often called by his name instead of by the name Hel, \nthe Goddess. \n\n1. Larousse, 211.2. Graves, G.M. 2, 393. \n\n\n\nHebrew "wisdom" \nin Proverbs 8 is \nHokhmah, from \nEgyptian heq-maa or \nHeka-Maat, the \nunderworld Mother of \nwisdom, law, and \nwords of power. 2 Greek \nand Roman cognate \nhagia meant holy, \nespecially as applied \nto the principle of \nfemale wisdom, \nHagia Sophia (see \nSophia, Saint). \nSimilarly in Israel, a \nhaggiah was a holy \nday. Certain Jewish \nreligious literature \ndating back to Israel\'s \nmatriarchal period \nwas probably written by \nwise-women, since it \nwas called the \nHaggadah. Later \npatriarchal rabbis \ndeclared this material \n"not legal." 3 \n\n\n\nHag \n\nOriginally "Holy Woman," the Hag was a cognate of Egyptian heq, \na predynastic matriarchal ruler who knew the words of power, or \nhekau. x In Greek she became Hecate, the Crone or Hag as queen of \nthe dead, incarnate on earth in a series of wise-women or high \npriestesses. \n\nIn northern Europe, the Hag was the death-goddess corresponding \nto Hecate, like the Hag of the Iron Wood whose daughter or virgin \nform was Hel. 4 Old Norse hagi meant a sacred grove, the Iron Wood, a \nplace of sacrifice. Haggen meant to chop in pieces, which is what \nhappened to sacrificial victims dismembered for a feast. "Hags" may \nhave been priestesses of sacrifice, like the Scythian matriarchs who \nbutchered for their sacred cauldrons and read omens in entrails. 5 \nNorthmen colonized Scotland, where a haggis or "hag\'s dish" was \nmade of internal organs. Until the 19th century, people kept the New j \nYear festival of Hagmena, Hag\'s Moon, going in disguise from house j \nto house, begging cakes. A chronicler said: "On the last night of the old \nyear (peculiarly called Hagmenai), the visitors and company made a \npoint of not separating till after the clock struck twelve, when they rose, \nand mutually kissing, wished each other a happy New Year." This is \nstill the custom. But a contemporary clergyman said the Hagmena \nmeant the Devil was in the house. 6 \n\nDevilish qualities were attributed to stone idols of the Hag, such as ; \nthe famous Stone of Scone, still used at each British monarch\'s \ncoronation. This stone once represented the Hag and her spinning \nwheel i.e., Arianrhod, Goddess of the Wheel of Fate. A Danish \nballad said the Hag of Scone led the "swarthy Elves"; but she was \nturned to stone by an incantation of the missionary St. Olave: "Thou 1 \n\n\n\n366 \n\n\n\nI Hag of Scone, stand there and turn to granite stone." 7 Helvetian Hair \n\ni converts to Christianity were compelled to batter to pieces sacred \n\nstones in which their Goddess dwelt, reciting her formula, "Once I was ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n| the Goddess and now I am nothing at all." 8 \n\nIn the 16th century, "hag" was synonymous with "fairy." 9 Old \nHigh German called a wise-woman Hagazussa, that is, a moon- \npriestess. 10 Though "hagiology" still means the study of holy matters \nand saints, the root word hag declined in its meanings. Shakespeare\'s \nverb bagged meant to be bewitched. His noun haggard meant a hawk, a \nI harpy, or an intractable woman. 11 \n\nThe Hag as death-goddess, her face veiled to imply that no man \ncan know the manner of his death, was sometimes re-interpreted as a \nnun. Christianized legends were invented for these veiled figures. 12 \n\n1 . Book of the Dead, 351. 2. Budge, G.E. 1 , 296. 3. Encyc. Brit, "Haggadah." \n\n4. Sturluson, 39. 5. Wendt, 137. 6.

Graves, W.G., 409. \n\n\n\nHair \n\nAs shown by its importance in witch-charms and in the mutual \nexchange of talismans between lovers, hair was usually viewed as a \nrepository of at least a part of the soul. At the ancient temple of \nTroezen, youths and maidens dedicated locks of their hair to the savior- \ngod Hippolytus before marriage; this was "designed to strengthen his \nunion with the Goddess." \' \n\nWhen the Goddess-mother became Queen of Shades for each god \nor man at the end of his life, his soul was likened to a child seeking \nsafety in the mother\'s shadow. The Great Mother\'s hair cast its shadow \nover the approaching soul. An Egyptian found salvation by identify- \ning himself with Osiris, for whom the Goddess made resurrection-magic \nwith her hair: "He is found with her hair spread over him; it is shaken \nput over his brow." 2 When Isis put on mourning garments for Osiris, \n(she cut a lock of her hair to preserve his soul. Egyptian widows \nsimilarly buried locks of their hair with deceased husbands, as a charm of \nprotection in the after-world. \n\nWhen Isis restored vitality to the dead Osiris, entitled the Still \nHeart, she created his new life with her hair, made his heart beat \nagain and his penis move so she could conceive his reincarnation, \nHorus. She "produced warmth from her hair, she caused air to \n\ncome She caused movement to take place in what was inert in the \n\nStill Heart, she drew essence (semen) from him, she made flesh and \nblood, she suckled her babe alone." ? She further protected her Divine \nChild by "shaking out her hair over him." 4 \n\nMortal women often claimed the same preservative magic for their \nown hair. Ptolemy III was protected from harm on his Syrian \ncampaign in 247 b.c. by his wife Berenice, who dedicated locks of her \nhair on Aphrodite\'s altar for this purpose. When the hair vanished \n\n\n\n367 \n\n\n\nHair \n\n\n\nCompendium \nMaleficarum A trea- \ntise on witches and \nwitchcraft compiled by \nGuazzoin 1608. \n\n\n\nfrom the temple, it was discovered among the divine figures in heaven, \nwhere it appears to this day as the constellation Coma Berenices, \n"Berenice\'s Hair." 5 \n\nSigns and wonders in the heavens were usually interpreted as \nsignificant omens of future catastrophes, particularly a comet, "spirit \nof hair." A comet was supposed to be a tendril of the Great Mother\'s \nhair appearing in the sky as the world was slowly overshadowed by \nher twilight shadow of doomsday. Most forms of the Death-goddess \nshowed masses of hair standing out from her head, sometimes in the \nshape of serpents, as in the Gorgoneum of Medusa-Metis-Neith-Anath- \nAthene. On the magic principle of "as above, so below," women\'s \nhair partook of the same mystic powers as the Goddess\'s hair. Tantric \nsages declared that the binding or unbinding of women\'s hair activat- \ned cosmic forces of creation and destruction. 6 \n\nThe same idea prevailed among prophetic priestesses or witches, \nwho operated with unbound hair on the theory that their tresses \ncould control the spirit world. Mother Goddesses like Isis, Cybele, and \nmany emanations of Kali were said to command the weather by \nbraiding or releasing their hair. Their corresponding mortal representa- \ntives could cause to be bound or loosed in heaven what they bound or \nloosed on earth hence the unflagging superstitious belief in Christian \nEurope that witches\' hair controlled the weather. Churchmen said \nwitches raised storms, summoned demons, and produced all sorts of \ndestruction by unbinding their hair. As late as the 1 7th century the \nCompendium Maleficarum said witches could control rain, hail, wind, \nand lightning in such a way. 7 In the Tyrol, it was believed that every \nthunderstorm was caused by a woman combing her hair. Scottish girls \nwere forbidden to comb their hair at night while their brothers were \nat sea, lest they raise a storm and sink the boats. 8 A Syrian exorcism for \nwerewolves invoked "that Angel who judged the woman that \ncombed the hair of her head on the Eve of Holy Sunday," suggesting a \nconnection between hair-combing women and the "werewolves" \nmythologized as dogs of doomsday. 9 \n\nSt. Paul greatly feared the "angels" (spirits) that women could \ncommand by letting their hair flow loose. He insisted that women\'s \nheads must be covered "because of the angels" (1 Corinthians 11:10). \nThus it became a Christian rule that women\'s heads must be covered \nin church, lest they draw demons into the building. Modern women \nwearing hats or head shawls to church unconsciously defer to this \nancient superstition about their hair. Due to identification of bats with \ndemons, the erroneous notion that bats tend to tangle themselves in \nwomen\'s hair arose from the same superstition. 10 \n\nThe ancients insisted that women needed their hair to work magic \nspells; thus women deprived of their hair were harmless. 11 For this \nreason, Christian nuns and Jewish wives were compelled to shave their \nheads. Inquisitors of the medieval church insisted on shaving the hair \nof accused witches before putting them to the torture. 12 Churchmen \n\n\n\n368 \n\n\n\nj claimed Satan told his worshippers that no harm could come to them Hair \n\nj "as long as their hair was on." Some inquisitors preferred to shave \ni body hair too; hence the expression "to make a clean breast" that is, _ \n\nto confess arose from the custom of shaving the chest hair of male \nwitches. \n\nInconsistently, churchmen apparently thought women should not \n(take the initiative and cut off their own hair. Cutting off her hair was \none of the crimes for which Joan of Arc was condemned to the fire. The \ncount read: "This woman is apostate, for the hair which God gave \nher for a veil she has untimely cut off." H Had she been tortured, as the \ninquisitors threatened, her hair would have been untimely cut off \n[anyway. It seemed that men wanted to do it themselves, not to be \nanticipated. \n\nMedieval Europe had innumerable superstitions based on the \npagan significance of hair. Children\'s hair was left uncut for many years \non the theory that their strength would be impaired if their hair was \ncut too soon. 15 Gypsy witches advised the lovelorn to snip a lock of the \nbeloved\'s hair secretly and wear it as a ring or locket. Whoever \npossessed another\'s hair had power over his soul. 16 Lovers often traded \nI hair-locks in token of good faith. If either betrayed the other, the hair- \nlock could be used to cast a vengeful spell on the betrayer. \n\nGypsies said a witch could be known by her hair, which grew \nstraight for three or four inches, then began to wave, like "a waterfall \nbouncing over rocks." This was one of the distinctively Hindu ideas the \ngypsies brought with them out of Asia. 17 The waterfall effect was \nproduced when naturally straight hair was kept in braids, a fashion of \nboth Hindu and gypsy women. During childbirth however, gypsy \nwomen always let their hair flow loose, on the magic principle that \nbraids or knots would "tie up" the birth. 18 European witch-midwives \noften shared this belief, but many also braided female hair into amulets \nto preserve suckling infants and their nurses. This custom continued \nin Ireland up to the 19th century. 19 \n\nHomer spoke of "Circe of the Braided Tresses, an awful goddess \nof mortal speech": that is, Circe\'s hair and words like Kali\'s controlled \ncreation and dissolution. 20 Circe was another name for the Fate- \nspinner, who sat at her loom weaving the destinies of men and \nsinging her spells of becoming. 21 Circe\'s braids symbolized her power \nover metempsychosis; she stood for the cosmic Cirque, or karmic \nwheel. 22 \n\nBraiding the round of Fate was expressed in pagan dances, like the \nMaypole dance, with ribbons signifying the rays of sun and moon. \nOn May Eve, female dancers circled the pole widdershins or moon- \nwise the counter-clockwise direction sacred to women while male \ndancers progressed in the other direction, sunwise. The resulting braid \nrepresented interpenetration of masculine and feminine powers. 25 \nThis heathen dance survives as the "braiding" figure in square-dancing \nknown as Grand Right and Left, in which men and women weave \n\n\n\n\n\n\n369 \n\n\n\nHair opposite directions around a circle, with or without touching hands as \n\nthey pass. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ For the sun gods, hair represented both "rays" and virility. Apollo\'s \n\nphallic function was implied by his epithet Chrysocomes, "He of the \nGolden Locks." Ceremonial castration was the meaning of solar gods\' \nhaircuts, like Samson\'s. A traditional site of the hero\'s castration or \nhair-cutting was Calvary, "Bald Skull," a hill where sacrifices were \nperformed. Romans sometimes called the Great Goddess Calva, \n"Baldness," a name so old that no one knew the reason for it. Like \nMoriah, it may have descended from an altar-crowned hill of \nsacrifice. 24 \n\nHead hair comes in for special attention in both West and East. Priests \nwho wish to conserve their vitality, to "cut off the outflows, " to use a \nBuddhist term, shave it off. His long hair was the repository of the Biblical \nSamson \'s energy. So is the Sikh s. The Indian god Shiva, who is the \npersonalized representation of the creative and sexual energy of the \nuniverse, is always represented as having a mass of long, tangled, piled- \nup hair on his head. Yogis who are his devotees imitate their divine pattern \nin this respect. Abundant hair represents the abundance of divine \nenergy, in the same way as Shiva \'s erect phallus. . . . [EJven today the \nordinary Indian believes that the way to avoid "catching cold" and stay \nhealthy (i.e., preserve his vital energy) is to wrap up his head, even if the \nrest of the body is practically naked. Hence the turban. 2S \n\nTantric sadhakas who worshipped hairy Shiva may have been \nthe original "Sadducees" of the Bible. A related sect of hermits known \nas Nazarites or Nazarenes were distinguished like sadhakas by their \nnever-cut hair, a tradition partly preserved by the uncut ear-locks of the \northodox Jew. The law of the Oriental holy hermit appears in the \nBible: "He shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head \ngrow" (Numbers 6:5). But Christians said a man having long hair \nwas shameful (1 Corinthians 1 1:14). \n\nAn opposing myth, relating virility to baldness, was promulgated \nby Hippocrates, possibly because he was himself subject to hair loss. \nHe said bald men are "of an inflammatory habit; and the plasma in their \nhead being agitated and heated by salacity, coming to the epidermis \nwithers the roots of the hair causing it to fall off." 26 Thanks to \nHippocrates, the mythic relationship between baldness and sexual \npotency has lasted up to the present day. \n\nAnother durable myth claimed a witch\'s hair would become a \nserpent when buried or placed in water, especially if the hair was \nplucked while the witch was menstruating. 27 This was another branch \nfrom the root of Gorgon mythology, where the female head with \nserpent-hair represented "wisdom" and warned would-be trespassers of \nthe menstrual taboo. \n\nHair was so universally associated with paganism that British \nchurches used to command men to shear their hair and beards on \nMaunday Thursday, the day before Good Friday, so they would be \n\n\n\n370 \n\n\n\nhonest" (i.e., "Christian") for Easter. Consequently this day is Hakkni Panki \n\n[escribed in old writings as Shear Thursday. 28 Halloween \n\n\n\n1. Frazer, G.B., 8. 2. Book of the Dead, 54, 400. 3. Budge, D.N., 250. \n\n4.

Circles generally \ncpressed cyclic religions; lines, like the rows of pews in a Christian \nlurch, expressed patriarchal linearity of ideas. \n1. Shah, 21. \n\n\n\nlalloween \n\nII Souls\' or All Hallows\' Day (November 1) was the Christian \njrsion of Samhain, the Celtic feast of the dead, named for the Aryan \n\n\n\n371 \n\n\n\nHa, Lord of Death, Samana, "the Leveller," or the Grim Reaper, leader \n\nof ancestral ghosts. According to the pagan lunar calendar, festivals wen \nHiMHi^HM celebrated on the "eve" rather than the day. Therefore Halloween or \nAll Hallows\' Eve was the original festival, later displaced to the follow- \ning day. The Irish used to call the holy night the Vigil of Saman. \nChurchmen described it as a night of magic charms and divinations, \nreading the future with witches\' mirrors and nutshell ashes, ducking \nfor apples in tubs of water (representing soul-symbols in the Cauldron o \nRegeneration), and other objectionable rites. Even today it is said that \na girl who peels an apple before a mirror on Halloween will see the \nimage of her future husband in the glass. 1 Christian authorities wrote \nof Halloween, "Many other superstitious ceremonies, the remains of \nDruidism, are observed on this holiday, which will never be eradicat- \ned while the name of Saman is permitted to remain." 2 The name of the \npagan deity remains in the Bible as Samuel, from the Semitic \nSammael, the same underworld god. \n\nOf course the original divinations were oracular utterances by the \nancestral dead, who came up from their tombs on Halloween, \nsometimes bringing gifts to the children of their living descendants. In \nSicilian Halloween tradition, "the dead relations have become the \ngood fairies of the little ones." 5 Similar customs are observed at \nChristmas. \n\nIn Lithuania, the last European country to accept Christianity, the \npagans celebrated their New Year feast at Halloween, sacrificing \ndomestic animals to their god Zimiennik (Samanik; Samana). Their \nprayer ran, "Accept our burnt sacrifice, O Zimiennik, and kindly \npartake thereof." 4 If the lord of the underworld accepted the offering or \nbehalf of all the dead, the spirits were satisfied and would refrain from \ndoing harm. If not adequately propitiated, they might descend on the \nworld as vengeful ghosts, led by demons and "witches" (priestesses) \nwho summoned them. The witches and ghosts are still associated with \nHalloween, together with such soul-symbols as owls, bats, and cats. \n\nThe pagan idea used to be that crucial joints between the seasons \nopened cracks in the fabric of space-time, allowing contact between \nthe ghostworld and the mortal one. \n\n1. de Lys, 365. 2.

At his birth, he was laid in a manger. He \n\n\n\n372 \n\n\n\nLvas sacrificed, buried, and resurrected: the sequence representing har- Hannah \n\nlest, re-planting, and new growth. His flesh and blood were Hapi \n\nbonsumed by his worshippers in the form of bread and wine. See _^^^__^_^ \n\nDemeter. ^^^^^^^^m \n\nThe deity was identified with the daily-reborn sun, so the halo was \ntlso a solar symbol, as in Egypt. In Christian hagiography it was \niometimes known as the aura, "circle of gold," which Byzantine art \nIhowed as a golden disc rather awkwardly attached at an angle to the \nback of the head. Still another variant was based on the Tantric idea of \nhe "thousand-petaled lotus of light" sprouting from the head of the \nCompletely enlightened sage. It was called the nimbus or "cloud" of \night, a symbol of divinity long before there were Christian deities or \naints. 2 \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 185. 2.

Hittites called her Hwanhwanar, the Nether Upsurge, married \no a sacred king at the Puruli festival, shortly before he was sent down \nnto her Abyss to become the new Lord of Death. 1 \n\nHannah\'s biblical son bore the same name as the Lord of Death, \nlama-El, Sammael or Samuel, from Samana, a Hindu title of the \neath-god Yama as Conductor of Souls. 2 \n\nIn Old Iranian, a clan matriarch was the hana, "grandmother." \nlimilarly, the Mother of the virgin mother was worshipped through- \nut the Middle East under such names as Hannah, Anna, Nana, \nn-anna, or "Queen Nana, the Creatress." 5 In Christian tradition she \nvas Anna, the Grandmother of God. 4 Mother of the virgin Mary was \ntona or Hannah, just as Anatolian Hannahanna was the mother of \nlie virgin Mari. Sometimes her virgin aspect was named Inaras, who \nf/as also a death-goddess. She annually imprisoned the sacred king in \ntemple tower, mated with him, then killed him. 5 (See Anne, Saint.) \n\nl.Gaster,7. 2. Lzrousse, 346. 3. Stone, 219. 4. Graves, W.G., 410. \n5.

Ancestral pre- \nynastic tribes of Egypt were said to be Hapi\'s children, therefore \nlapi was originally a form of the Great Goddess. Like most of the \nIdest Oriental divinities, "he" was associated with the yonic lotus. 1 \n\n1. Lamusse, 36, 38. \n\n\n\n373 \n\n\n\nHar \nHathor \n\n\n\nvar. Harmonia \n\n\n\nHar \n\nIshtar as the patroness of temple prostitutes or harines was known as \nthe Great Goddess Har. Like Greek horae, Persian houris, and other \nsacred Aarlots, her priestesses occupied the part of the temple that \ncame to be called Harem, the Sanctuary. 1 Kings had to prove their \nvirility, hence their right to rule, by impregnating the harines, until it \nbecame a custom to let certain priests take over this duty. (See \nProstitution.) \n\nFrom the root Aarcame Hara, Hebrew for both a holy mountain \nand a pregnant belly; Hariti or Haraiti, the "Lofty Mountain" of \nparadise in both pre-Vedic Dravidian and Old Iranian cosmology; and \nHarmonia, a "daughter of Aphrodite," a bringer of peace, one of the \nfunctions of the holy harlot. Harmonia was mythologized as an ancient \nqueen of Boeotia, married to Cadmus, whose name in Phoenician \nwas kedem, "the Oriental." 2 When Cadmus and Harmonia died and \nwent to paradise, they were both transformed into serpents. 3 Probably \nthey were assimilated to the male-and-female, perpetually entwined \nserpents of the Hermetic caduceus, whose meaning was "Life."

They had bird bodies \nwith women\'s heads and breasts, suggesting the Minoan style of \nfunerary priestesses in feather costumes with bare necks and bosoms. \nTheir name meant "snatchers" or "pluckers," perhaps related to \ntheir use of the harp in funerary music, since a harp is played with \nplucking motions. 1 Patriarchal Hellenic myth made the Harpies \nobnoxious monsters, but they seem to have been once the same as \ndakinis or Valkyries.

In the earliest dynasties, her name was a component \nof all royal Egyptian names, indicating the archaic matrilineal queenship: \nbased on successive incarnations of her spirit. 1 \n\nHathor was worshipped in Israel in the 1 1th century b.c. at her \n\n\n\n374 \n\n\n\n[wn holy city of Hazor, which the Old Testament claims Joshua Heart \n\n[estroyed (Joshua 1 1:13, 21). The Sinai Tablets show that Hebrew \n\nporkers in the Egyptian mines of Sinai about 1 500 B.C. worshipped _^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nHathor, whom they identified with the Lady of Byblos, Astarte. 2 \n\nSome sources said there were seven Hathors: the Holy Midwives \nssociated with the seven heavenly spheres. They gave each Egyptian \nSeven souls at birth. Sevenfold Hathor entered medieval myth as the \ndry godmother(s) and Mother Goose, as well as the Mother of the \nlun King, the Lady of the Lake, and the Huntress. \n\nIn Upper Egypt, Hathor was Sati or Satis, She of the Two River- \nlanks, source of the Nile. 3 Her Destroyer aspect was a lion-headed \niuntress, the Sphinx, sometimes called Sekhmet or Sakhmis, "the \nj\'owerful." Like Kali, she drank the blood of gods and men. \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 1, 92-93, 428, 431. 2. Albright, 96, 1%. 3. Erman, 4. \n\n\n\nHeart \n\nlb was the Egyptian word for heart-soul, most important of the \neven souls bestowed by the seven birth-goddesses (Hathors). The ab \n\'as the soul that would be weighed in the balances of Maat after \nleath, in her underground Hall of Judgment, to see if it was too heavy \nrith sins to balance her Feather of Truth. The ab was most \nnportant because it was the central blood-soul emanating from the \njsence of the mother. \n\nThe maxim that a pregnant woman carries her child "under her \nHeart" began with the Egyptians, who believed menstrual blood that \nuade the child\'s life descended from the mother\'s heart to her womb, \n[he maternal heart, then, was the source of the child\'s life, which \n| as why a mother called her child "heart\'s blood." The Book of the \n[|)ead addressed prayers to "My heart of my mother. . . . My heart of \nansformations," meaning the source of rebirths. 1 \n\nSignificantly, the meaning of the Egyptian word for the mother- \niven heart was reversed in Hebrew; ab was re-defined as "father." \n\nThe Egyptian hieroglyphic sign for ab was a dancing figure, and as \nverb it meant "to dance." 2 This referred to the mystic dance of life \nring on inside the body the heartbeat. The same mystic symbol in \nidia was the Dance of Shiva, who was supposed to dwell at the \nKiting heart of the cosmos within the world-body of Kali. Shiva went \nirough certain cycles when he was temporarily dead, known as \nhava the Corpse, and his dance ceased until his Mother resurrected \nim again. Similarly, the Egyptian god Osiris passed through a death \nbase before the Goddess brought him back to life. In this phase he was \nlown as the Still-Heart.\' \n\nLike other mummies, Osiris\'s mummy received a new ab, "heart \nnulet," always made of red stone and placed in the mummy\'s breast \nbring back vitality. 4 The custom of removing the mummy\'s real heart \n\n\n\n375 \n\n\n\nHeart \n\n\n\nActs of John \n\nA famous Gnostic text, \nnever entirely \nsuppressed although the \northodox church \nrepeatedly denounced it \nthrough the \ncenturies for its \nheretical assertion \nthat, as a deity, Jesus \ncould not actually die \non the cross. \n\n\n\nprobably dated back to primitive ritual offerings of human hearts to \nthe Goddess, who was addressed. in some archaic prayers as "swallower \nof hearts." 5 As always, the primitive theory was that what a deity gave \nmust be returned at least in part, to keep up the deity\'s energy to give \nmore. The same kind of sacrifices took place on the sacred pyramids \nof Mexico. Victims identified with the dying god were cut open quickly, \nso the heart could be offered still alive and "dancing." The Egyptian \nword ab also meant an offering as well as a heart, suggesting that at \nsome point in Egyptian history the sacrificial victims were deprived of \ntheir hearts. 6 Juvenal said the Egyptians offered human sacrifices and \nate human flesh. The Egyptian Goddess took an underworld form as \na monster Ab-She, "She Who Eats Hearts." 7 The old texts said the \nGoddess devoured what she created, after the manner of Kali, and \nEarth, and Time, and Fate: "she taketh possession of hearts, she \nswalloweth." 8 \n\nUp to the present century, Bantu witches remembered Egyptian \nideas well enough to believe they could cast a death spell by \nsymbolically eating the intended victim\'s "heart life," a concept very lik< \nthe Egyptian ab. 9 Many phrases still in English usage date back to the \nEgyptian idea of the heart as the center of the self, the soul, or the \nemotions. One is heavy-hearted or light-hearted; hope brings "new \nheart"; grief makes the heart ache or break; love steals the heart away, or \nmakes the heart full; absence makes the heart grow fonder; hearts \nmay be given, or taken, or withered, or gladdened; hearts may be warm \nor cold, hard or soft. \n\nSo vital was the idea of the heartbeat in Oriental religions that the \nvery center of the universe was placed "within the heart" by Tantric \nsages. 10 This place was Chidambaram, where Shiva danced to the basic \nrhythm of eternity. The sages said: "Sound (nada) represents the \nState of Power. It is experienced by the yogi when he plunges deep into \nhimself. It is made manifest in the heartbeat. And since the micro- \ncosm is finally identical with the macrocosm, when the yogi hears the \nNada, this Sound of Power, he is listening to the heartbeat of the \nAbsolute." 11 \n\nIn this expression of the basic mystical idea that deity is within the \nhuman being, the sages in effect admitted that man creates God. The \nheartbeat was also said to establish the fundamental tempo for poetry, \nsong, music, and dance. \n\nThe Tantric idea of the heart\'s dance surfaced in early Gnostic \nChristianity, when Jesus was equated with the dancing god-within. In | \nthe Acts of John, Jesus said to his followers: "To the Universe belongs \nthe dancer. He who does not dance does not know what happens. \nNow if you follow my dance, see yourself in Me who am speaking. . . . \\ \nYou who dance, consider what I do, for yours is this passion of Man \nwhich I am to suffer." n \n\nThough the church outlawed ecclesiastical dancing early in the , \nChristian era, the theme of the dancing god within the heart was not \nforgotten. Eventually it led to the concept of the Sacred Heart, adopted \n\n\n\n376 \n\n\n\ns an article of Catholic faith late in the 1 7th century. An oddly Hebe \n\nbminine symbolism was attached to this re-working of the heart-soul \n\nidea. Jesus\'s divinity was "the moon dwelling in the heart." His ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\niacred Heart was described by all the metaphors attached to the ancient \n\nllother-heart: "as \'the temple in which dwells the life of the world,\' \n\nb a rose, a cup, a treasure, a spring, as the furnace of divine love ... as a \n\njridal chamber." B \n\nThe church claimed that the Sacred Heart began with the divine \njision of St. Margaret Marie Alacoque in 1675. However, the idea \nlas not original with her. An alchemical textbook published 1 1 years \njefore her birth depicted the Sacred Heart encircled by a crown of \nhorns. Several centuries earlier, it was shown on a stained-glass window \nf the Convent des Cordeliers in Paris; on a Jacobin cloister wall; on \nJ window of the Chapel of St. Thomas Aquinas; and in four places of \nhe Carmelite church of St. Michael. Some of these "certainly \nelonged to the 1 5th and 16th centuries." H And of course, the concept \nf the divine heart-soul at the core of the living world that is, \nhiva\'s Sacred Heart, or Osiris\'s belonged to the millenia, long before \nhere was a Christian church. \n\n1 .

Greek myths said Hebe was cupbearer to the gods, \nispenser of their ambrosia of immortality. Without her, the gods would \nrow old and die, the same doom that threatened the Norse gods \n\'hen they lost Freya. 1 \n\nLike Eve, in her Mother aspect Hebe governed the Tree of Life \n\'ith its magic apples, source of the gods\' everlasting life, which they \nalously guarded from mankind (Genesis 3:22). Heroes like Heracles \nould become immortal gods by marrying Hebe and living in her \narden of paradise, where they could feed on the apples of the holy \nee. 2 Such myths show that Hebe was only Hera virginized, for Hera \ntas the owner of the serpent-guarded apple tree in the far-western \naradise, known to the Greeks as the garden of the Hesperides. \n\nAfter Hellenic Greeks introduced a social system of patriarchy and \nlie fashion of romantic-homosexual love, Father Zeus evicted Hebe \ntorn her traditional post and replaced her with his own male concubine, \nJanymede. Thus the Virgin Goddess was supplanted by the Youth, \npe gods\' new cupbearer, taken to heaven and dwelling in the stars as \npe constellation Aquarius. 5 \n\nl.Branston,249. 2.

Hecuba \n\n\n\nHecabe \n\nMatriarchal queen of Troy, embodying the spirit of the Moon- \ngoddess Hecate, whose name was the same as her own. Hecabe\'s \n"daughters" (priestesses) had divinatory powers, and the ability to cast \nspells, as shown by the legend of Cassandra. Hecabe herself laid \neffective curses. When captured by her enemies, she transformed \nherself into Hecate\'s totemic shape, a black bitch named Maera, Mara, \nor Moera, the Destroying Fate. 1 The wanderings of Odysseus were \nattributable to the curse of exile she laid on him; he was preserved from \ndeath only the by the counter-spell of his wife the Goddess Penelope. \n\n1. Graves, CM. 2, 342. \n\n\n\nHecate \n\nOne of the oldest Greek versions of the trinitarian Goddess, Hecate \nwas derived from the Egyptian midwife-goddess Heqit, Heket, or \nHekat, who in turn evolved from the heq or tribal matriarch of pre- \ndynastic Egypt: a wise-woman, in command of all the hekau or \n"mother\'s Words of Power." \' \n\nAs a heavenly midwife amalgamating the Seven Hathors of the \nbirth-chamber, Heqit delivered the sun god every morning. 2 Her \ntotem was the frog, symbol of the fetus; and this animal was still sacred \nto her four thousand years later when she became the Christians\' \n"queen of witches." \n\nIn Greece, Hecate was one of many names for the original \nfeminine trinity, ruling heaven, earth, and the underworld. Hellenes \ntended to emphasize her Crone or underworld aspect, but continued to \nworship her at places where three roads met, especially in rites of \nmagic, divination, or consultation with the dead. 3 Her images guarded \nthree-way crossroads for many centuries; thus she was Hecate Trevia, \n"Hecate of the Three Ways." Offerings were left at her roadside shrines \non nights of the full moon. As a deity of magic and prophecy she was \ninvoked by those who set out on journeys, like the biblical king of \nBabylon, who "stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ] \nways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with \nimages" (Ezekiel 21:21). \n\nHecate was called "most lovely one," a title of the moon. 4 Like all i \nother forms of the Triple Goddess, she was associated with the moon ] \nin all three of her aspects. Some said she was Hecate Selene, the Moon, \nin heaven; Artemis the Huntress on earth; and Persephone the \nDestroyer in the underworld. 5 Ancient texts referred to her as Hecate i \nSelene the Far-Shooting Moon, mother of Dionysus though Dio- \nnysus was also the son of Persephone, which shows that Hecate and \nPersephone were often confused with one another. 6 Sometimes \nHecate was considered identical with Diana Ilithyia, the Moon-goddess \\ \nas protectress of parturient women. Sometimes she was part of the \n\n\n\n378 \n\n\n\nDueen-of-Heaven trinity, Hebe the Virgin, Hera the Mother, Hecate \n[he Crone. Porphyry wrote: \n\nThe moon is Hecate, the symbol of her varying phases. . . . [HJer power \nappears in three forms, having as symbol of the new moon the figure in \nthe white robe and golden sandals, and torches lighted; the basket which \nshe bears when she has mounted high is the symbol of the cultivation of \nthe crops which she made to grow up according to the increase of her \nlight. 7 \n\nLate Hellenic writers devised a rather labored explanation for \nHecate\'s journey from the sky to the underworld, originally a mythic \nrietaphor for the moon\'s setting. Hecate was in the house of a \nwoman in childbirth. The gods, fearing magical contagion from this, \nllunged her into the river Acheron to wash away the traces of birth- \nnana. The river carried Hecate underground, where she married \nHades. This was a myth derived from patriarchal anxieties about \nlontact with childbearing women, demonstrated especially in the Bible \nJLeviticus 12:5). Ritual bathing of mother and child in a sacred river \nIfter the lying-in period probably gave rise to the story of Hecate\'s river- \nburney. \n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, Hecate became known as Queen \n\\{ the Ghostworld, or Queen of Witches. She was especially diabo- \nIzed by Catholic authorities who said the people most dangerous to the \npith were precisely those whom Hecate patronized: the midwives. 8 \nHer ancient threefold power was copied, however, by priestly writers \nl/ho reassigned it to their own deity: "The threefold power of Christ, \nlamely in Heaven, in earth, and in Hell." 9 \n\n1.

A king\'s virility was periodically tested, and when it \naned, he was usually killed and replaced. When King Fjolnir of \nweden "became impotent," he was drowned in a vat of mead, the \nDmmon euphemism for the sacred cauldron. 1 A similar custom \nisposed of biblical kings, like David, who died very soon after the \nlaiden Abishag proved him impotent (1 Kings 1:4). \n\n\n\n379 \n\n\n\nHeirmarmene j he Cerne Giant of Dorset was said to represent the Saxon god \n\ne Heill, personification of phallic spirit, as shown by his erect penis. \n\n^^^h The church claimed St. Augustine built Cerne Abbey to commemorate \nthe downfall of this lusty "devil," but it seems the shrine was dedi- \ncated to Heill in the first place, and simply taken over by Christian \nmonks. 2 \n\n1.

In Egyptian salva- \ntion-mysteries, rote learning of hekau was necessary to gain admission \nto various areas of the after-world. Also useful were amulets like the \nHekat, a uterine "ark" named after the Goddess. See Ship. \n\n\n\nHel \n\nNorse Queen of the Underworld, whose name became the English \n"hell." Dead heroes who went to the house of Hel were known as \nHelleder, "Hel\'s men." 3 Sometimes they were ancestral ghosts \nknown as Hella cunni, "kinsmen of Hel," corrupted in the medieval \nmystery play to Harlequin, lover of Columbine the Dove-maiden, \nwho was another version of the Goddess. 4 The Celtic Lord of Death, \nwearer of the apex or pointed tiara of divinity, bore the title of \nHelman. 5 \n\nThe early "hell" seems to have been a uterine shrine or sacred \ncave of rebirth, denoted by the Norse hellir. 6 The notion of Hel as a \ncauldron-womb filled with purgative fire may have been related to the \nidea of the volcanic Mother-mountain (Latin caldera). In the Pacific, \n\n\n\n380 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMother Hell or Mother Death was often a fire-mountain entered by \nway of a sacred cave. The Hawaiian volcano-goddess Pele, like Hel, \nkept souls of the dead in regenerative fire. Pele and Hel may have had \nlinguistic connections, as p and h may be interchanged in Indo- \nEuropean languages. In Malekula, the dead live in a volcano under the \nGoddess\'s rule: "Abiding in that fire is bliss; there is no fear of being \nconsumed." Japan\'s sacred volcano was named for the fire-goddess Fuji, \n"Grandmother" or "Ancestress." 7 Similarly, Hel was a fire-mountain \naccording to German legend; the emperor Theodoric became immortal \nby entering her womb through a volcano. 8 \n\nThe Infernus of classical paganism contributed to the Christian \namalgam of images of Hel\'s land. Infernus meant an oven in the \nearth; an old Roman proverb said "the oven is the mother." Roman \novens and bakeries were associated with temples of the Goddess, \nwhose harlot-priestesses were often called Ladies of Bread. Their orgies \nwere called Fornacalia, "oven-feasts," from fornix, the "oven" which \ngave us both "furnace" and "fornicate." 9 Naturally, Christian authori- \nties maintained that tasting the sacred fire of eternity through \n"fornication" was a sin. \n\nMedieval legends spoke of Hel as Brunnhilde, "Burning Hel," also \nthe name of a leader of the Valkyries, otherwise known as Hild the \nAvenger. 10 Another of her names was Matabrune, "Burning Mother," \nwho gave birth to King Oriant, a version of the Oriental sun god born \nat dawn from the bowels of the earth. 11 \n\nMagic fire surrounding the Valkyrie\'s castle was an allegory of \ncremation fire, through which a hero passed enroute to Hel. Crema- \ntion of the dead was later forbidden by the Christian church, on the \ntheory that cremation destroyed the body and prevented "resurrec- \ntion of the flesh" according to the orthodox dogma. The more practical \nreason for outlawing cremation was that, as a pagan ceremony, it \nbrought no revenue to the church. 12 It was profitable, however, to \ncremate witches while they still lived; inflated charges were made for \nevery rope, nail, and stick of wood. B \n\nSome myths suggest that Hel was originally envisioned as not fiery \nbut dark: a Crone-goddess like Black Kali, eater of the dead. As the \nNether Moon, she was called Nehellenia. Her ancient altars were found \nin Holland at the mouths of the Rhine. 14 Vases and statues from her \nshrines were discovered in Zealand in 1646. 15 Sometimes, her under- \nworld was not hot but ice cold, as if serving as a model for Dante\'s \ninnermost circle of the Inferno. The cold, dark Queen of Shades was \nNef-Hel or Nifl. \n\nHel was supreme and inescapable, seizing even gods in her \nembrace. The Swedes said Odin the Heavenly Father was buried in a \nbarrow known as Hel\'s Mount. 16 Because she was associated with \nmountains, Hel sometimes merged with Mother Freya. A fate- \nspinning Goddess called Hel of the Air was worshipped on the \nLuftelberg. 17 She was simultaneously diabolized as feminine counter- \npart of the Prince of the Power of the Air (Odin-Satan) who led the \n\n\n\nHel \n\n\n\nIn various dialects \nHel was Holle, Halja, \nHild, Helga, Holde, \nHelle, Ella, or Hellenia. \nHelgo, Heligoland, \nHelsinki, Hollingstedt, \nHolderness, \nHolstein, and Holland \nwere a few of the \nmany place names \nderived from her. \nShe was the usual tomb- \nwomb of rebirth after \ndeath. Iceland still has a \ntraditional "home of \nthe dead" in Helgafell \nor Hel\'s Hill. 1 In \nGermany, "Dame \nHolle\'s Well" was \ncalled the source of all \nthe children on \nearth. 2 \n\n\n\n381 \n\n\n\nHelen of Troy Wild Hunt. Tenth-century witchcraft texts said the heathen women \n\nrode forth under the leadership of "the witch Holda." 18 \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ Like her Greek twin Hecate, Hel sometimes wore all three faces oi \n\nthe Triple Goddess. The German poem Gudrun represented her as \nthe ruler of Holland, incarnate in three virgins living in a mystic cave: \nHild, princess of Isenland, Hilde, princess of India, and Hildburg, \nprincess of Portugal. All three resembled mermaids or wood nymphs. \nThe legendary Prince Hagen married all three Hels, after the usual \nritual combat with an elder king. 19 \n\nBallads and sagas depicting such encounters between mortal men \nand supernatural women were collectively described as "hellish" \nthat is, hellig, medieval Danish for "holy." 20 \n\nPliny said all the inhabitants of "Scatinavia" (Scandinavia) were \nchildren of Mother Hel, thus they were called Helleviones. 21 They \nconsidered their Goddess incarnate especially in elder trees, which were \nstill called Hel-trees or elven-trees in the Middle Ages. Danish \npeasants prayed at elder trees to the Hyldemoer, that is, Hel-mother, or \nElder-mother. 22 \n\nHel\'s ancient connection with fertility was still evident in her \nmedieval titles, Lady Abundia or Satia (abundance, satiety). In this \nguise she led the "ladies of the night" called Hellequins, who rode forth \nto receive offerings of food and drink from common folk, promising \nin return to bring prosperity on the house. 23 Apparently these were not \nmere legends but real women, carrying on the Goddess\'s nocturnal \nfestivals. Hel was despised by the church, but the common people seem \nto have thought her more benevolent than otherwise. Her under- \nworld was reached by crossing a river, like the Greek Styx; the river was \nGjoll, "Wailing." On the bridge that crossed it stood the Goddess\'s \nemanation, Modgudr (Good Mother), ready like the Orphic Perseph- \none to greet the deceased and see him safely into eternity. 24 \n\nNorthern shamans believed they could put on the Helkappe, a \nmagic mask or Hel-met, which would render them invisible like \nghosts, and enable them to visit the underworld and return to earth \nagain without dying. The Helkappe seems to have represented the \nshamanic trance, in which death and resurrection were experienced as a \nvision. See Mask. \n\nI. Turville-Petre, 55. 2. Rank, 73. 3. Steenstrup, 149. 4.

The ancients didn\'t view the underworld as primarily a place of \nlishment. It was dark, mysterious, and awesome, but not the vast \nire chamber Christians made of it. \n\nGreeks called the underworld Erebus, Hades, or Tartarus, from \n"tortoise" incarnation of Vishnu, who was supposed to support \n| earth in the form of a tortoise. Shades of the dead dwelling in \narus endured no torment other than the general cheerlessness of \nlg dead. Lacking blood, shadows, voices, and vital energy, they \nted yearningly for rebirth. \nLike the realms of earth and heaven, the underworld had its social \nlierarchy. Queen Persephone or Hecate, her consort Pluto or Hades, \nuled magistrates like Aeacus, Rhadamanthys, and Minos, who were \n\n\n\n\n\n\n383 \n\n\n\nHe " wizard-kings on earth. There were spirits like Hypnos (Sleep), \n\nMorpheus (Dreams), and Thanatos (Death). 1 Sometimes, as in the \n\nh^^^hh medieval vision of fairyland, the underworld was a place of sensual \n\ndelight. In the Elysian Fields, souls of the enlightened ones were tende \nby the Goddess\'s divine nymphs. \n\nLike the Egyptian nether god, Seker or Amen, Hades was "the \nunseen one" the ubiquitous Hidden God in his intra-uterine, \nsleeping, or dead Black Sun phase. Lord of the Underworld or Lord of \nDeath, he was also a phallic deity, holding the "key" to the nether \nyonic gate, as his heavenly counterpart Petra (Peter) held the key to th \nPearly Gate of Celestial Aphrodite. The nether god was supposed to \ndeposit his semen in rocks, where it solidified into precious gems, a \nwestern version of the Jewel in the Lotus. Thus he was Lord of \nRiches also. Romans called Hades by the name of Dis, short for Dives, \n"the rich god." 2 Most savior-gods who "harrowed hell," or plowed \nthe earth-womb, were credited with the power to reveal buried treasure \na power inherited by the Christian devil. 5 \n\nEgyptians called the underworld Amenti, Khert-Neter, Neter- \nKhertet, or the Tuat. It was both a hell and a paradise, a place of \njudgment and rebirth. Egyptian religion didn\'t emphasize punishment \nfor sin. Egypt\'s savior Osiris came to save humanity not from \neverlasting torture, but from death. 4 Egyptians feared death, which thej \ncalled an "abomination," and devoted most of their religious efforts \nto avoiding it. 5 \n\nEgyptian pictures of "the wicked" being destroyed in underworld \nfire-pits were interpreted by Christians as torments of damned souls. \' \nHowever, these "wicked" were not necessarily human. They were \nsupernatural enemies of the sun god: spirits of darkness, mist, storm. \nThe fire-pits seem to have represented the burning clouds of sunrise \nand sunset. Even when victims were human, their burning was not \neternal. \n\nEgyptians did not believe in purgatory or everlasting punishment. . . . \n[T]he wicked were slaughtered daily and their bodies consumed by fire, \nbut each day brought its own supply of these, and thus the avenging gods \nwere kept busy daily, and the fire-pits were filled with victims daily. \nThere is no evidence in the texts that the Egyptians thought the burning \nof the same victims could go on forever. 6 \n\nThe idea of eternal torture in hell arose with ascetic patriarchal \nreligions like that of Zoroastrian Persia. Masculine preoccupation with \npain stood in contrast to the matriarchies\' preoccupation with plea- \nsure, a psychic outgrowth of the severities of the ascetic life. There is \nreason to believe hell\'s nastier torments were invented primarily to \nintimidate women into obeying new patriarchal laws. \n\nZoroastrian priests insisted women who were unfaithful to their \nhusbands would go to hell and have their breasts torn open with iron \ncombs. Women who scolded would be forced to lick hot stoves with j \ntheir tongues. Women who showed disloyalty to men would be hung \nup by one leg, while scorpions, snakes, ants, and worms dug their way ir. \n\n\n\n384 \n\n\n\ni and out of their bodies. 7 A similar vision inspired Grunewald\'s Hell \n\n| medieval picture of the hellish torments in store for those who commit- \nted the crime of loving. 8 But not even the Persians supposed the ^^^^^-i^^-^_ \nItorments of hell would go on forever. That refinement of cruelty was \n(left to the Christians. \n\nThe Jews adopted the Persians\' hell as a place for punishing the \n(majority of women, judged hopelessly unworthy of the Father-god\'s \njheaven. Men could be consigned to hell for holding too much unneces- \nsary conversation with their wives, or for taking feminine advice. 9 \n(The female creation-river Gihon was converted into Gehenna, the \nJewish hell\'s river of fire, whose name was sometimes applied to the \niwhole land. The kingdom of Gehenna was 60 times as large as the \nworld. Each of its "palaces" had 6000 "houses," and each house had \npOOO vessels of fire and gall awaiting the sinner. Prince of Gehenna was \n(Arsiel, copied from the Chaldean "Black Sun" Aciel, the negative \ndeity corresponding to the god of light in the celestial realm. 10 \n\nJudeo-Christian tradition populated hell with all the biblical baalim, \neven those who had been identified with Yahweh himself: Behe- \nmoth, Leviathan, Baal-Peor, Baal-Zebub, Baal-Rimmon, Belial, \nKsmodeus, Molech, Lucifer, Satan, Tammuz, Dagon, Nehushtan, \nChemosh (Shamash), Apollyon: even Baal-Berith, the "God of the \n|3ovenant." These were joined by gods and goddesses of classical \nreligions: Hades, Pluto, Diana, Persephone, Hermes, Python, Hecate, \nMinerva, Venus, Cybele, Attis, Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn, Adonis, \nran, Lamia, Medusa, Lilith plus all the gods and goddesses of \nOermanic and Celtic paganism. Even those who were artificially \ncanonized, to convert their old shrines into churches, were often \n[ [imultaneously diabolized and consigned to hell in the guise of \nlemons. \n\nThere was a curious medieval passion for identifying, classifying, \npd naming all the demons. Sorcery required knowledge of their \n> lames and titles. An exorcist could do nothing until he learned the \n[jiame of the demon he dealt with. The Gospels said even Jesus \niieeded to learn the names of the Gadarene devils he exorcised (Mark \n|>:9). Thus, many sources provided lists of demonic names. \n\nOne of the most interesting dissertations on hell was Johann \n[Meyer\'s Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, published in the 16th cen- \nury when Weyer served the Duke of Cleves as a healer and diviner. \ni Weyer said there were exactly 7,405,926 demons, divided into 72 \nBompanies. These figures had already been reported in the Talmud. 11 \nMiupreme Chief of the Infernal Empire and founder of the Order of \n[he Fly was Beelzebuth (Baal-Zebub), the old Philistine Lord of Flies. \nI His lieutenants included Satan, Leader of the Opposition; Pluto, \nl*rince of Fire; Moloch, Prince of the Land of Tears and Grand Cross \nIf the Order of the Fly; Baal, Commander-in-Chief of the Infernal \nArmies and another Grand Cross of the Order of the Fly; and Lucifer, \nJ Lord Chief Justice of hell. \n\nBaal-Berith, erstwhile God of the Covenant, filled the post of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n385 \n\n\n\nHe" Minister of Treaties. Nergal, husband of the Babylonian under- \n\nground Goddess Eresh-kigal, became hell\'s Chief of Secret Police. Th \n^^^^^^^^^^h Royal Household included Melchom (Milcom) as Paymaster, and \n\nthe Philistine god Dagon as Grand Pantler. The Hebrew elephant god \nBehemoth (originally Ganesha, father of Buddha) was Grand Cup- \nBearer. Among the Masters of the Revels, Asmodeus held the post of \nSuperintendent of Casinos. Antichrist was only an insignificant jug- \ngler and mimic. 12 \n\nThe infernal hierarchy also maintained embassies in various Eurc \npean countries. Thamuz, or Tammuz, was Ambassador to Spain. \nBaal-Rimmon, Phoenicia\'s "Lord of the Pomegranate," was Ambassa- \ndor to Russia. England\'s ambassador was Mammon, whose \nappointment reflected continental resentment of the English zeal for \ncommerce. \n\nSexual prejudice also extended to the denizens of hell. There wa! \nonly one token female among hell\'s governing spirits: Proserpine, \ncalled Arch-she-devil and Sovereign Princess of Mischievous Spirits. \nAstaroth (Astarte) was present only in masculine disguise, as a "duke" \nof hell and its Grand Treasurer. The Goddess Belili took two male \nshapes, as Belial and Belphegor, hell\'s ambassadors to Turkey and \nFrance. \n\nMasculinized Goddesses appeared also in Collin de Plancy\'s \nDictionnaire infernal, an imitation of Weyer\'s Pseudomonarchia, \nshowing portraits of a male "demon Ashtoreth" and a male "demon \nEurynome." Even Lilith was masculinized as a hellish "prince" in \nAlexis de Terreneuve du Thym\'s list of devils: "Beelzebub, the su- \npreme chieftain; Satan, the dethroned prince; Eurinome, prince of \ndeath; Moloch, prince of the Land of Tears; Pluto, prince of fire; Pan, \nprince of the incubi; Lilith, prince of the succubae; Leonard, grand \nmaster of the Sabbaths; Daalberith (Baal Berith), high pontiff; and \nProserpine, the arch she-devil." 13 \n\nWhat Weyer\'s solemn imitators never understood was that the \nPseudomonarchia was really an elaborate joke, invented as a carica- \nture of earthly hierarchies. Humor and skepticism were equally foreign \nto the Age of Faith, when the core of learning was credulity. It was a \nchildlike age. Generations of would-be Magi soberly studied Weyer\'s \nmockery in search of demonic names to use in magic charms. \n\nWeyer not only mocked the Christian hierarchy; he also defendet \nwitches. As a physician, he was called to examine some of the \nInquisition\'s victims, and pronounced them harmless, deluded women \nwho could not be held responsible for the statements wrung from \nthem by torture. He tried unsuccessfully to halt the tortures and \nburnings. For this he was accused of heresy and indecency. Father \nBartolomeo da Spina scorned Weyer with heavy-handed irony: "Re- \ncently Satan went to a Sabbath attired as a great prince, and told the \nassembled witches they need not worry since, thanks to Weyer and his i \nfollowers, the affairs of the Devil were brilliantly progressing." H \n\n\n\n386 \n\n\n\nBut, Weyer aside, hell was not a joke. It was perhaps the most \nsadistic fantasy ever conceived by the mind of man. It was described, \npainted, and contemplated with incredibly perverse relish. Berthold of \nRegensburg said sinful folk must imagine their punishment in hell as \nthe pain of a body made white-hot in a white-hot universe. "Let them \ncount the sands of the sea-shore, or every hair that has grown upon \nman and beast since the days of Adam; let them reckon a year of \ntorment for each of those hairs and, even then, the sinner will be only \nat the outset of his unending agony." 15 Martin of Braga said anyone \nwho renounced Christianity would be "put physically into eternal fire \nin hell, where the inextinguishable flames burn for ever . . . and such a \nman shall long to die again, and not feel the punishment, but he will \nnot be allowed to." 16 \n\nChurchmen claimed the fires of sexual passion were transmuted \ninto the fires of hell, blown by the breath of God into a heat fiercer \nthan any earthly flame. A single drop of sweat from a damned soul \nwould pierce living flesh like an arrow and burn like acid. One was \ntold to imagine the pain of being covered with such sweat, forever. 17 \nThe story of sinner\'s sweat was often told throughout the Middle \nAges. It may have been inspired by a passage from the Mahabharata: \n"As the lord of gods, whose energy is infinite, became angry, a \nterrible drop of sweat came out of his forehead; and as soon as that drop \nof sweat had fallen to the earth, an enormous fire like the fire of \ndoomsday appeared." 18 \n\nPerhaps the worst part of the hell-vision was theologians\' insistence \nthat the joy of the blessed ones in heaven couldn\'t be complete unless \nthey were permitted to gloat over the sufferings of the damned. St. \nGregory the Great assumed with appalling naturalness that the "good" \npeople in heaven would be entirely without pity. St. Thomas Aquinas \nwrote: "In order that nothing may be wanting to the felicity of the \nblessed spirits in heaven, a perfect view is granted to them of the \ntortures of the damned." Other fathers of the church proclaimed that, \nwhile the greatest pleasure of the saved would be contemplating the \nDivine Essence, their second greatest pleasure would be watching the \ndamned writhing in hell. They couldn\'t feel sorry for loved ones or \nfriends in torment, because their opinions would always be identical \nwith God\'s; and God apparently reveled in sinners\' pain. 19 \n\nThomas of Cantimpre mentioned some "simple folk" who wor- \nried about having to watch former friends or relatives suffering in \nI hell. He said these worries were foolish, because no one in heaven could \ngrieve for anything. He cited the Blessed Marie d\'Oignies, who saw \nj in a vision that her dead mother was damned, and so stopped mourning \nfor her at once. 20 \n\nSt. Bernardino of Siena argued that heaven must be perfect, and \nperfection couldn\'t be achieved without "due admixture of groans \nfrom the Damned." Only a few people were good enough to be saved; \nthe vast majority would go to hell. This was the orthodox opinion. \n\n\n\nHell \n\n\n\nThomas of \nCantimpre 13th- \ncentury scholar and \nencyclopedist, author of \nOn the Nature of \nThings. \n\n\n\nSt. Bernardino of \n\nSiena (1380-1444) \nFranciscan \n\ntheologian, writer, and \nitinerant preacher, \ncanonized in 1450, six \nyears after his death. \n\n\n\n387 \n\n\n\nHell \n\n\n\nRaymond Lull \n\n(Raimundo Lulio) \nCatalan philosopher \nof the late 13th century, \nauthor of numerous \nmystical works in \nCatalan, Arabic, and \nLatin. Lull was revered \nin the Franciscan \norder as Doctor \nUluminatus and as a \nsaint in some areas. He \nwas never officially \ncanonized, though \nPope Pius IX \nconfirmed his cultus in \n1858. \n\n\n\nRaymond Lull was condemned as a heretic for trying to teach that \nChrist\'s mercy would save nearly all men. Christ was not that \nmerciful; only the mother Mary was that merciful. An Ethiopian \nChristian legend said Mary was distressed to see her kinfolk in \nhellfire, and asked God to give humanity holy writings that would save \nthem. 21 \n\nThe sadism implicit in the fantasy of hell was all too graphically \nenacted by the inquisitors\' tortures and burnings. The Inquisition\'s \nhandbook directed that "eternal damnation should begin in this life, tha \nit might be in some way shown what will be suffered in hell." 22 The \ninquisitor Bodin considered even slow burning a negligible punishment \nin view of its sequel: "Whatever punishment one can order against \nwitches by roasting and cooking them over a slow fire is not really very \nmuch, and not as bad as the torment which Satan has made for them \nin this world, to say nothing of the eternal agonies which are prepared \nfor them in hell, for the fire here cannot last more than an hour or so \nuntil the witches have died." 23 Of course, the witches so mercifully slain \noften had been subjected to unendurable tortures already for weeks, \nmonths, or even years. \n\nThe inquisitor Nicholas Remy said witches "are justly to be \nsubjected to every torture and to put to death in the flames; both that \nthey may expiate their crimes with a fitting punishment and that its \nvery awfulness may serve as an example and a warning to others." To \nhelp them remember the occasion, witches\' children were to be \nstripped and beaten with rods around the stakes where their mothers \nwere burning. 24 Inquisitors obviously disliked children. They burned \n"witches" 10 or 12 years of age, or even younger. 25 At Wiirzburg in \n1629, children as young as 7 were executed for witchcraft, plus many \nothers of 10, 12, 14, or 15 years. 26 \n\nUp to the 19th century, hell was used as a convenient way to \nthrow the "fear of God" into children. Father Furniss\'s Sight of Hell \npresented the following edifying fantasies to young people: \n\nOf two little maids of sixteen, one cared only for dress, and went to a \ndancing school, and dared to disport in the park on Sunday instead of \ngoing to mass: that little maid stands now, and forever will stand, with bare \nfeet upon a red-hot floor. The other walked through the streets at \nnight, and did very wicked things; now she utters shrieks of agony in a \nburning oven. A very severe torment immersion up to the neck in a \nboiling kettle agitates a boy who kept bad company, and was too idle to \ngo to mass, and a drunkard; avenging flames now issue from his ears. \nFor like indecencies, the blood of a girl, who went to the theatre, boils in \nher veins; you can hear it boil, and her marrow is seething in her bones \\ \nand her brain bubbles in her head. "Think, " says the compassionate \nfather, "what a headache that girl must have!" 27 \n\nDutch theologian Dirk Camphuysen opposed such crude train- j \ning of the young, on the theory that it was more disturbing to sensitive ( \nminds than corrective of sinful ones. Unable to refrain from commit- \n\n\n\n388 \n\n\n\nting some sins, people developed a personal conviction of doom, "which \nnecessarily produces such great fear and agony in the soul, that life is \ntoo frightening for them, and they find death by their own hand. Of this \nthere are not a few examples, and some of them known to me \npersonally. Others do not go as far as suicide, but fall into fits of \nmelancholy and despair, sometimes ending in madness." 28 \n\nJohn Wesley was so implacable as to maintain that the whole \nChristian religion depended entirely on the horrors of hell. If there \nwere "no unquenchable fire, no everlasting burnings," then all New \nTestament teaching is a lie, and there is no reason to believe in the \nrevelation of heaven. 29 Yet some theologians disagreed. Johann Clop- \npenburg said in 1682: "It is absurd that God should be angry forever, \nand punish the finite sins of creatures with infinite punishments." 30 \n\nSome thinkers maintained that only an evil God could create a hell \nso savage and deliberately allow human beings to fall into it, when he \nhad the power to prevent this. The doctrine of free will was invented by \nthe church to counteract this logic; but, as Bayle showed, "absolute \nfree will is of no real use in justifying hell or in theodicy in general." \nMan\'s free will "does not exculpate God from being ultimately \nresponsible for the sins He punishes, unless one takes from Him His \nomniscience as well as His omnipotence. . . . [I]f, before the creation, \nHe foresaw that most men would abuse their free will and commit sins, \nhe could have refrained from creating them." 31 The same sentiment \nwas put forth more than 2000 years ago by the author of 2 Esdras, who \ndemanded why God had bothered to create Adam if he couldn\'t \nrestrain Adam from sinning. \n\nIn wrestling with the problem of God\'s responsibility for hell, \ntheologians of the 17th and 18th centuries often found themselves \nforced by their own logic into a basically Manichean image of an evil \nGod. Sterry said "an angry, revengeful God is no God at all, but a \nprojection of men\'s evil passions. . . . If sin is part of God\'s plan, then \nthe sinner as much as the saint can claim to be fulfilling God\'s will." \nJurieu admitted "the absolute impossibility of reconciling God\'s hatred \nof sin with His permission of it." He re-phrased Esdras\'s question: "If \nGod has an infinite hatred of sin, why, having foreseen it, has He not \nprevented it? Why has He made men be born who, He well knew, \nwere to damn themselves? " Bayle described God as "a lawgiver who \nforbids man to commit crime, and who nevertheless pushes man into \ncrime, and then punishes him for it eternally." Thus he must be a God \n"in which one could have no trust, a deceiving, cunning, unjust, \ncruel nature; He is no longer an object of religion." 32 Whiston even \nconcluded that the very existence of hell must condemn God in the \neyes of humanity: \n\nThe exquisite torments of these most numerous and most miserable \ncreatures, are determined without the least pity, or relenting, or bowels \nof compassion in their Creator, to be in everlasting fire, and in the flames \nof Hell; without abatement, or remission, for endless ages of ages. And \n\n\n\nHell \n\n\n\nJohann Cloppenburg \n\n1 7th-century \ntheologian, author of \nthe Compendium \nSocinianismi \nConfutatum. \n\nPierre Bayle. 17th- \ncentury French \ntheologian of Calvin- \nist or pseudo-Calvinist \nbackground. \n\n\n\nSecond Book of \nEsdras (also known as \nthe Ezra Apocalypse) \nOne of the \napocryphal books \neliminated from the \nEnglish Bible but \nappearing as an \nappendix to the New \nTestament in the \nLatin Vulgate. \n\n\n\n389 \n\n\n\nHell all this for the sins of this short life; fallen into generally by the secret \n\nsnares of the Devil, and other violent temptations; which they com- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ monly could not wholly either prevent, or avoid . . . instances . . . of the \n\nabsolute and supreme power and dominion of the cruel and inexorable \nauthor of their being. n \n\nPolitical implications of the "problem" of hell were set forth by \nPetersen: \n\nWhat fruit has the doctrine of eternal damnation borne up till now? Has it \nmade men more pious? On the contrary, when they have properly \nconsidered the cruel, frightful disproportion between the punishments and \ntheir own finite sins, they have begun to believe nothing at all, and have \nthought that these books of Holy Scripture have just been compiled by the \npriests, who made up such threats for the common people as they \nthought fit, in order to keep them in check. 3 * \n\nOf course blaming the fiendishness of hell on God, or Satan, or \nAdam, or any other mythic figure was a way of avoiding recognition of \nthe fact that its real inventors were men. Eastern sages were more \nfrank; they said "the torments of hell are morbid creations of the \nindividual\'s own ideas." 55 The ideas of the individual, however, were \ncreated by the society in the case of hell, by the church. As Chaucer\'s \nSummoner slyly said, people sometimes thought the friars came by \ntheir familiarity with hell in a direct manner: \n\nThis friar boasts his knowledge about Hell, \nAnd if he does, God knows it\'s little wonder; \nFriars and fiends are seldom far asunder. J6 \n\nThough the possibility is seldom recognized, there are many \nindications that the Christian vision of hell in its sadistic horror was one \nof the leading causes of disillusionment with Christianity itself. Hell \nwas necessary, otherwise there was nothing for "salvation" to save from; \nyet it often seemed people were sent to hell for no greater sin than \nbeing human. William Blake said, "When thought is closed in caves, \nthen love shall show its root in deepest Hell." ?7 \n\nIn the end, scholars were forced to renounce hell because it made \nGod look more vindictive than man, though few dared admit that the \nvindictiveness sanctioned and stressed by the church was really man\'s \nalone. Shaftesbury said it was impossible to adore a God "whose \ncharacter is to be captious and of high resentment, subject to wrath and \nanger, furious, revengeful ... (of) a fraudulent disposition, encourag- \ning deceit and treachery among men, favorable to a few, though for \nslight causes, and cruel to the rest." Bayle found it impossible to \nexonerate "a good and omnipotent God" from responsibility for the \nworld\'s evils, though he made humanity suffer for them. The \nproblem became "infinitely more difficult when He has also to be \nexonerated from causing the suffering and wickedness of the next \nworld." 38 \n\n1. Larousse, 166. 2.

The death-dealing God- \ndess Anath was colored red with henna before immolation of human \nvictims to her image. 1 Gypsy legends preserved something of the \nassociation between henna and the sacrificial ceremonies of Mari- \nAnath. They claimed Mary was preparing to redden her hair with \nhenna at the very moment when her son was crucified; therefore she \nlaid a curse on the red pigment that was formerly sacred. 2 Jewish \nscriptures spoke of "daughters of Cain" i.e., women who didn\'t \nworship Yahweh whose hands and feet were "dyed with color" in \nthe Oriental fashion. 3 \n\nLike all other trappings of women\'s religions, henna was associated \nwith witchcraft in the Middle Ages. One of the heretical crimes for \nwhich the Spanish Inquisition arrested women was the use of henna to \nredden the skin or nails. 4 During the Victorian era, an Essex woman \nwas charged with witchcraft for no other reason than the discovery in \nher house of some "red ochre," or henna. 5 \n\n1.

Hephaestus was one of the \nancient Amazonian smiths, an opponent of the divine Father. He \ntook Hera\'s side in her quarrels with Zeus; he married Aphrodite; he \nwas on affectionate terms with the primal Sea-goddesses Thetis and \nEurynome; he shared a temple with Athene. He was lame, like all the \nAmazonian smiths. He was associated with volcanoes and lightning, \nlike all early gods who fertilized the Great Mother\'s "abyss" with fire. \nOne of Hephaestus\'s major shrines was the island of Lemnos, a \nmatriarchal colony founded by Amazons. 1 \n1. Graves, CM. 1,87-88. \n\n\n\n391 \n\n\n\nHera \n\n\n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and geographer \nof the 2nd century \na.d. Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the \nancient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nHera \n\nHera\'s name was sometimes rendered "Lady," and may have meant \nHe Era, the Earth. An earlier version was Rhea, the pre-Hellenic Great \nMother mythologized as the mother of the Greeks\' Hera. Both were \nforms of the Great Goddess of early Aegean civilization, who predated \nthe appearance of gods on the scene. 1 \n\nHera\'s name could also have been a cognate of Hiera, "Holy \nOne," a title of ancient goddess-queens who ruled in her name. An \nAmazon queen named Hiera of Mysia led her army against the Greeks \nin defense of matriarchal Troy. Philostratus said Homer refused to \nmention Hiera in the Iliad because she was so great as to outshine \nHomer\'s heroine, Helen. 2 \n\nThere were many other, more far-flung cognates and counterparts \nof Hera. In Babylon she was "Erua, the queen, who controls birth." 3 \nShe chose kings, gave them sovereignty by marrying them, and deposed \nthem. As the eponymous Goddess of ancient Ireland she was "the \nLady Eire," or Eriu. 4 Like Hera, the Lady Eire controlled the western \napple-garden of immortality. \n\nHera was the Mother of the Gods, even of the Olympian gods, to \nwhom she gave the ambrosia of eternal life. Hellenic writers tried to \nmake her subordinate to Zeus, though she was much older than he, and \nhad married him against her will. Their constant mythological quar- \nrels reflected conflicts between early patriarchal and matriarchal cults. \nAs the primordial feminine trinity, Hera appeared as Hebe, Hera, and \nHecate new moon, full moon, old moon otherwise personified as \nthe Virgin of spring, the Mother of summer, and the destroying \nCrone of autumn. Pausanias said Hera was worshipped as Child, Bride, \nand Widow. 5 In her Argive temple, she passed through endless cycles \nas her virginity was annually renewed, like that of Aphrodite, by \nimmersion in a holy spring. 6 \n\nHera received sacrifices of "heroes," or "Hera-sacred men," \nwhose myths dated from a primitive time when men were slain as her \nmartyr-bridegrooms. In ancient Greece the term "hero" was synony- \nmous with "ghost" one who had gone to the Goddess. 7 Herodotus \ntold the story of two of these heroes, Cleobis and Biton, chosen to draw \nthe Mother\'s chariot in a procession. Afterward they "fell asleep" in \nher temple and never woke again. This holy death reflected great honor \non their family; Solon called Cleobis and Biton "the happiest of \nmen." 8 Like Christian martyrs, they achieved the "crown." \n\nHera\'s cult spread at an early date throughout pagan Europe, the \nwhole continent having been named after one of her incarnations, \nEuropa. Saxons worshipped her at Heresburg (Hera\'s Mount), where \nthe phallic "column of the world" called Hermeseul was planted in \nthe Earth-goddess\'s yoni. 9 Late in the 8th century a.d., the temple was \ndestroyed and the phallic pillar overthrown by the armies of Charle- \nmagne. However, the sanctuary was not forgotten. The Salic Law \nreferred to "witches" called hereburgium or herburgium, those who \n\n\n\n392 \n\n\n\nworship at the Heresburg. 10 They were equated with those who \n"carried the cauldron" to religious meetings in honor of the God- \ndesssuch meetings as the clergy styled witches\' sabbats. Legends of \nHera\'s magic garden in the west, where the apples of immortality \ngrew, passed into the medieval lore of Fairyland. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,51. 2. Bachofen, 107. 3. Assyr. & Bab.

His Twelve Labors symbolized the sun\'s passage \nthrough the twelve houses of the zodiac, the heavenly "way" indicat- \ned for him by the same river of celestial milk. After his course was \nfinished, he was clothed in the scarlet robe of the sacred king and \nkilled, to be resurrected as his own divine father, to ascend to heaven, to \nmarry the virgin form of the Goddess all over again, and to dwell \namong the stars, where he is still found. \n\nPausanias said Heracles\'s surname was Soter (Savior). 1 Julian said \nof him, "All the elements obey the demiurgic and perfective power of \nthis pure and unmixed spirit, whom the great Zeus has begotten to be \nthe Savior of the Universe." He was worshipped everywhere as the \nsavior who "died" and rose again like the sun, which is why a solar \neclipse was supposed to have attended his death the same mythic \neclipse appended to the deaths of Krishna, Buddha, Osiris, and Jesus. 2 \n\nThe influence of Heracles\'s cult on early Christianity can hardly \nbe overestimated. St. Paul\'s home town of Tarsus regularly re- \nenacted the sacred drama of Heracles\'s death by fire, which is why Paul \nassumed there was great saving virtue in giving one\'s body to be \nburned, like the Heracles-martyrs (1 Corinthians 13:3). Heracles was \ncalled Prince of Peace, Sun of Righteousness, Light of the World. \nHe was the same sun greeted daily by Persians and Essenes with the \nritual phrase, "He is risen."\' The same formula announced Jesus\'s \nreturn from the underworld (Mark 16:6). \n\nHeracles also entered the underworld and "harrowed hell," the \nfructifying function of the King of Glory who "came in" to the \nwomb of the Earth-goddess (Hera). She gave him his second birth and \nmade him a god hence his title, dedicated to her glory. 4 He was \nsacrificed at the spring equinox (Easter), the New Year festival by the \nold reckoning. He was born at the winter solstice (Christmas), when \nthe sun reaches his nadir and the constellation of the Virgin rises in the \neast. 5 As Albert the Great put it centuries later, "The sign of the \n\n\n\nJulian (Flavius \nClaudius Julianus) \nRoman emperor \nfrom 361 to 363 a.d., the \nonly pagan to rule \nRome after the time of \nConstantine; \nnicknamed "the \nApostate" by \nChristian historians \nbecause he tried to \nre-institute the old \nRoman religion. His \ndeath was mysterious; \nsome claimed he was \nassassinated by a \nChristian. \n\n\n\n393 \n\n\n\nHeracles celestial virgin rises above the horizon, at the moment we find fixed for \n\nthe birth of our Lord Jesus Christ." 6 \n^ ^ _ The celestial virgin to whom Heracles ascended was sometimes \n\nHebe, or Hera-as-Maiden, or Eve as she was called in the Middle \nEast. Like Isis, she said the fruit of her womb became the sun. 7 Often \nshe was confused with Cyprian Aphrodite, who was really the same \ncelestial virgin incarnate in the attendant Horae who followed the god \nthrough his risings and settings on the wheel of time: "In twelve \nmonths the silent pacing Horae follow him from the nether-world to \nthat above, the dwelling of the Cyprian Goddess, and then he \ndeclines again to Acheron." 8 \n\nIn Lydia, Heracles was bound to the cosmic wheel of Queen \nOmphale, the Goddess incarnate, representing the hub of the universe \n(omphalos). He was one in a succession of her sacred kings. His \npredecessor was the oak-crowned Tmolus, who died by impalement \nafter coupling with the high priestess. Another earlier model of the \nwheel-kings was Ixion of the Lapiths, who died on a fiery wheel \nsignifying the revolutions of the sun. Such a sacrificial custom \nprobably underlay the myth of Heracles bound to the wheel and made \nto spin for a year that is, to turn through the signs of the zodiac \nwhich decorated the wheel. 9 Hellenic writers re-interpreted the myth to \nmean Heracles spent a year as a slave among Omphale\'s women, \nspinning flax on a spinning wheel, wearing female dress, a story \ninvented to explain the early stage in the evolution of sacred kingship \nwhen a man could be the queen\'s deputy only when wearing her \nrobes. 10 Priests of Heracles wore female garments up to a fairly late \ndate. \n\nAnother myth said Heracles\'s predecessor was the centaur Nessus, \nwho engaged in combat with Heracles for possession of the priestess \nDeianira. Heracles won, and married Deianira. Nessus died, bequeath- \ning his blood-red ceremonial robe to the conqueror. Later, when his \npriestess-wife ordained that he must wear the robe, Heracles put it on \nand burned as if "wrapped in flames." His pyre was lighted by the \nnext king, Philoctetes, who inherited his emblems of office. 11 \n\nAn Egyptian version of the same dying-and-reborn "hero" was \nHorus, or Heru, firstborn of Isis-Hathor. 12 In his dying aspect he was \nthe enfeebled form of Ra, named Harakhti, declining toward his \nburning pyre in the west, to be devoured by the Mother\'s under- \nground womb. Greeks called his holy city Herakleopolis, "City of \nHeracles." n The same sun-and-fire god was known in the Far East \nas one of the Ten Knowledge-Holding Deities, still remembered as "the \nmost Supreme Heruka." H \n\nEgypt continued to celebrate the fiery death and rebirth of a mock \nking up to the 19th century a.d., on the first day of each year by \nCoptic reckoning. The god-man was placed on a throne for three days, \ncrowned with a tall pointed miter like that of pharaohs, May Kings, \nCarnival Kings, Lords of Misrule, and other pagan savior figures. Then \n\n\n\n394 \n\n\n\nI he was burned in effigy and crept forth "reborn" from the ashes of his \n\nroyal garment. Frazer says, "The custom points to an old practice of \nI burning a real king in grim earnest." 15 According to Tertullian, as \n\nlate as the 3rd century a.d. the people of Carthage were still annually \nburning "men who were gods of light." 16 \n\nHaving died a martyr\'s death, Heracles ascended to heaven with- \n! out delay and received a place on the right hand of the Crone, or \n\nCrown Corona Borealis, the constellation of the martyr\'s reward. \ni\\ Christian martyrs were promised the same "crown" in heaven. \nj Meanwhile, Heracles\'s reward on earth was claimed by Christian \n\npriests: that is, tithes, from the Roman military custom of donating to \nI Heracles\'s temple a tenth part of the spoils of victory. 17 \n\nAs another underworld Lord of Death, Heracles was credited with \n1 the same power to reveal buried treasure that was later inherited by \n\nthe Christian devil. 18 \n\n1.

He was really older than \nGreece, one of the Aegean Great Mother\'s primal serpent-consorts, \n[partaking of her wisdom because he was once a part of her. Like India\'s \nArdhanarisvara Kali and Shiva united in one body Hermes was \nthe original "hermaphrodite" united in one body with Aphrodite. \nPriests of Hermes wore artificial breasts and female garments to \npreside over Aphrodite\'s Cyprian temple in the guise of the god \n[Hermaphroditus. 1 \n\nHermes was a universal Indo-European god. An Enlightened One \nborn of the virgin Maia, he was the same as the Enlightened One \n(Buddha) born of the same virgin Maya in India. The Mahanirvanatan- \ntra said Buddha was the same as Mercury (Hermes), the son of the \nMoon (Maya). 2 \n\nGreeks called Hermes the Psychopomp, Conductor of Souls, the \nsame title everywhere given to the Lord of Death in his union with \nthe Lady of Life. Hermes had greater power over rebirth and reincarna- \ntion than the heavenly father Zeus. It was Hermes who transferred \nDionysus from the womb of the Moon-goddess to Zeus\'s "thigh" \n(penis) so he could be born from a male; apparently Zeus couldn\'t \naccomplish this miracle for himself.* \n\nHis feminine wisdom credited Hermes with the invention of \ncivilized arts usually attributed to the Goddess: measuring and weigh- \ning, astronomy and astrology, music, divination by knucklebones. He \n\n\n\n\n\n\n395 \n\n\n\nHermes helped the three Fates compose the alphabet. 4 He could control the \n\nelements. His caduceus could transform whatever it touched into gold, \nn^H^^Hi^ which is why Hermes became the patron of alchemists. 5 \n\nOvid said Hermes was married to the lunar priestess of a sacred \nfountain in Caria, the Land of the Goddess Car. He was also part of a \ntrinity with Mother Earth and Father Hades, and a phallic god of the \norgiastic Cabiri who worshipped Demeter Cabiria in the Mysteries of \nPhrygia and Samothrace. 6 \n\nHermes\'s phallic spirit protected crossroads throughout the Greco- \nRoman world, in the form of herms, which were either stone phalli or \nshort pillars with Hermes\'s head at the top and an erect penis on the \nfront. During the Christian era, the herms were replaced by roadside \ncrosses, but the idea of setting these votive erections at crossroads was \npagan rather than Christian. \n\nSaxons worshipped Hermes as the phallic spirit of the Hermeseul, \nor Irminsul, planted in the earth at the Mother-mount of Heresburg \n(Hera\'s Mount). It is now known as Eresburg, and a church of St. Petei \nstands where Hermes\'s ancient sanctuary united the phallic principle \nwith Mother Earth. Other Germanic tribes worshipped Hermes under \nthe name of Thot or Teutatis, "Father of Teutons." 7 Hermes- \nMercury was the same as the Germanic father-god Woden, which is \nwhy the Hermetic day, Wednesday, is Woden\'s Day in English but \nMercury\'s Day in Latin languages. \n\nThe Cross of Woden also represented Hermes as "the only \nfourfold god." The sign of the cross traced by Christians on their \nheads and breasts originated as one of the crosses of Hermes, the Arabic \nnumeral 4, often appearing upside down or backward as the Chris- \ntians\' gesture drew it. 8 The medieval legend that witches made the sign \nof the cross upside down or backward may have begun with worship- \npers of Hermes; actually, Christians had reversed the cross-sign made by \nthe pagans instead of vice versa. \n\nThe cross marked Hermes a god of four-way crossroads, the four \nquarters of the earth, the four elements, the four divisions of the \nsacred year, the four winds, and the solstices and equinoxes represented \nby their zodiacal totems Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, and Aquarius the \nbull, lion, serpent, and man-angel symbols adopted by Christians to \nrepresent the four evangelists. 9 Sometimes, the cross of Hermes was \nan ankh, standing on a crescent that signified his mother the moon. This \n\nevolved into the conventional sign of Mercury, a circle with a cross \n\nSign of Mercury (Hermes) below and a crescent above. 10 \n\nHermes was also represented by the Gnostic "world" sign, a \nMaltese cross with a circle at the end of each arm. 11 This seems to \nhave referred to the four solstitial and equinoctial suns. Gnostics viewed \nHermes as a personification of the World Serpent, ruler of time, who \ncoiled around the terrestrial egg. 12 According to Gnostic Gospels, Jesus i \ntold Mary that the serpent surrounded the world, with his tail in his \nmouth, his body containing the twelve zodiacal halls that is, he was \n\n\n\n396 \n\n\n\n\nidentified with the Egyptian Tuat (Thoth) and the druidic ouroboros, \n\nalso known as the Wise Serpent Hermes. 13 \n\nNeoplatonic philosophers called Hermes the Logos, or Word of \n| God made flesh. 14 Christian images of Jesus as the Logos were \n| borrowed from the older deity, whose hymns addressed him in terms \nI similar to those used in the Gospels: \n\nLord of Creation, the All and One. . . .He is the light of my spirit; his be \nthe blessing of my powers. . . . Hymn, O Truth, the Truth, O Good- \nness, the Good, Life, and Light, from you comes as to you returns our \nthanksgiving. I give thee thanks O Father, thou potency of my powers; \nI give thee thanks O God, the power of my potencies. Thine own Word \nthrough me hymns thee. . . . Thou pleroma in us, O Life, save us; O \nLight, enlighten us; O God, make us spiritual. The Spirit guards thy \nWord. . . . From the Eternal I received blessing and what I seek. By thy \nwill have I found rest. 1S \n\nNaturally, Hermes became the "god within" sought by all \nreligious philosophers of the Gnostic period. (See Antinomianism.) \nHis traditional bisexuality was interpreted as self-love; some said he \ninvented the ritual of self-love, that is, masturbation. His caduceus was \njcalled a masturbatory symbol, a rod massaged by the serpents that \nembraced it. 16 Masturbation was said to be the hermit\'s typical act of \nself-contemplation, which some claimed would lead to comprehen- \nision of the God, just as sexual intercourse led to comprehension of the \nilGoddess. A "herm-e\\" was literally a little Hermes, with a divine \nI spirit dwelling in the phallus. \n\nHermes lived on through the Middle Ages in a new disguise as \nHermes Trismegistus, Hermes the Thrice-Great One, founder of \n(systems of Hermetic magic, astrology, alchemy, and other blends of \n[mysticism with natural science. Lazzarelli\'s Calix Christi et Crater \niHermetis (Chalice of Christ and Cup of Hermes) said all learning came \nfrom Hermes, who gave it to Moses in Egypt. Agrippa von Nette- \nj >heim often cited the authority of Hermes, whom he took for a \nU\'randson of Abraham. Burton\'s Anatomy of Melancholy listed Her- \nInes as one of the great philosophers, along with Socrates, Plato, \nPlotinus, Seneca, Epictetus, the Magi, and the druids. 17 A 16th- \ncentury treatise said the Hermetic vessel was "a uterus for the spiritual \nrenewal or rebirth of the individual . . . more to be sought than \nIcripture." 18 \n\nHermetic magic was extensively cultivated by the Arabs, who \nbased much of their numerical and alchemical systems on Hermetic \nlore. 19 Sufi mystics and eastern alchemists both claimed Hermes as an \nInitiate of their craft. 20 After the crusades, Europeans developed a new \nninterest in what they regarded as the ancient wisdom of the east, and \n[became greatly impressed by any philosophy attributable to classical \nlantiquity. \n\nAbout 1460 a Greek manuscript of the eastern Corpus Hermeti- \nfum was presented to Cosimo de\' Medici by a monk named \n\n\n\nHermes \n\n\n\n397 \n\n\n\nHermes \n\n\n\nSir Thomas \n\nBrowne (1605-1682) \nEnglish physician, \nauthor of the famous \nReligio Medici and \nother works. \n\n\n\nLeonardo da Pistoia. Other texts were added later to the growing body \nof semi-secret "devilish arts" which commanded more and more of \nthe attention of European intellectuals. Sir Thomas Browne called \nHermetism "the mystical method of Moses bred up in the Hiero- \nglyphical Schools of the Egyptians," stating that the Egyptians \nworshipped Hermes as Mercurius or Anubis, "the Scribe of Saturn, \nand Counsellor of Osiris, the great inventor of their religious rites, and \nPromoter of good unto Egypt." Hermes ascended to heaven in the \nform of Sirius, the Great Dog. He was so revered in Italy that the \nmosaics of Siena Cathedral portrayed him with the inscription, \n"Hermes Mercury Trismegistus, Contemporary of Moses." 21 \n\nThe Christian mythological figure most often assimilated to Her- \nmes was the archangel Michael, Angel of Death, with a function \nresembling that of the ancient Psychopomp. "On the ruins of ancient \ntemples of Mercury, built generally on a hill, rose chapels dedicated \nto St. Michael." A hill formerly sacred to Hermes-Mercury in France \nstill bears the name of Saint Michael-Mont-Mercure. It lies opposite \nanother "Michael\'s Mount" located across the channel in England. 22 \n\nSpirits of the two mounts were both called Mercurius in pre- \nChristian times, perhaps representing the twin serpents that expressed \nHermes\'s dual function as lord of death and rebirth. The twin serpents \nhad many incarnations in alchemy and magic. Of them Flamel \nwrote: "These are snakes and dragons, which the ancient Egyptians \npainted in the form of a circle, each biting the other\'s tail, in order to \nteach that they spring of and from one thing. These are dragons that the \nold poets represent as guarding sleeplessly the golden apples of the \nHesperian maidens. . . . These are the two serpents that are fastened \naround the herald\'s staff and the rod of Mercury." 25 \n\nHermetic mysticism usually called the serpents male and female, \n\nfor the real secret of Hermetic power was androgyny. Like that of \n\nOriental gods, Hermes\'s efficacy depended on his union with the \n\nfemale soul of the world, like the Aphrodite of his archaic duality. In \n\nmedieval texts she was called the Anima Mercury, a naked woman \n\nsurrounded by oval mandorla designs like the World card of the \n\nTarot pack. 24 This card was the last of the Tarot trumps, and the \n\nMagician, identified with Hermes, was the first numbered trump. A \n\nMantegna Tarot showed the Magician as a classic Mercury with \n\nserpent-twined caduceus, winged helmet, and flute, stepping over a \n\nsevered head symbol of oracles toward a cock, the symbol of \n\nannunciation. 25 \n\n1.

The \nGospel story says Herodias demanded the head of John the Baptist and \nhad her dancing daughter obtain it from Herod. This made her a \nprime religious villainess, and about the 10th century a.d. her name \nbegan to be taken as a synonym for Hecate, Queen of Witches. Yet \nthe classic belief that Hecate was that third of the Triple Goddess who \nruled the underworld, while her other personae Hebe and Hera ruled \nheaven and earth, came to be applied to Herodias as the new Hecate. In \n936 a bishop of Verona formally denounced "those who believe that \nHerodias rules one-third of the world." ! \n1. J.B.Russell, 75. \n\n\n\nHesione \n\n"Queen of Asia," a Syrian title of Atargatis, or Meri-Yamm, the \nGreat Goddess of the sea in conjunction with her serpent. Greeks \nclaimed Hesione was rescued from a sea serpent by Heracles, another \nversion of the Perseus-Andromeda myth. The original fight probably \nwas the one between Baal and the sea serpent Yamm for the sexual \nfavors of the Asian Goddess. (See Kingship.) \n\n\n\nHesperides \n\nGarden of immortality in the Far West, belonging to Mother Hera \nwho sometimes took the form of Hespera, the Evening Star (Venus). \nApples of eternal life grew on the Hesperian apple tree, guarded by \nHera\'s sacred serpent. Like most versions of the earthly paradise or \nEden, this one was located beyond the Pillars of Heracles (Gibraltar). \n\n\n\n399 \n\n\n\nHestia The Pillars were not only the straits leading to the western sea, but also \n\nHex the phallic shafts that stood in front of the ancient temples, the \n\nl ^^^ mt ^ ammmmamm Garden being the temple itself, symbol of Hera\'s regenerative womb. \n\n\n\nHestia \n\nGreek "Hearth," one of the oldest matriarchal Goddesses, in Latin, \nVesta. She represented the home place, every man\'s "center of the \nworld." When the matriarchs ruled, "The hearth was in the midst of \nthe dwelling; that hearth was to each member of the household, as it \nwere, an umbilicum orbis, or navel of the earth . . . [h]earth being \nonly another form of earth, as in the German erde and herde." \nPythagoras said the fire of Hestia was the center of the earth. 1 \n\nRomans had the same idea about the altar of Vesta, with its \nperpetual fire tended by the mystic Vestal Virgins. Cicero said the \npower of Vesta extends over all altars and hearths, therefore all prayers \nand offerings begin and end with her, "because she is the guardian of \nthe innermost things." 2 \n\nHestia never had a consort, for no god could share her strictly \nmatriarchal province, the Prytaneum or public hearth of every town. \nIt was said of her that "seated in the midst of the celestial dwelling-place \nshe receives the richest part of sacrifices, and among men she is of all \nthe deities the most venerated." i \n\n1.

Unlike wives, they were free to \nattend schools, establish salons, and take a vital part in social and \nintellectual life of the time. \n\nTheir title may have been related to Egyptian heter, "friendship,\' \nwhose hieroglyphic sign was two women grasping each other\'s \nhands. 1 \n\n1. Budge, E.L., 51. \n\n\n\nHex \n\nThis word for a witch\'s spell had a long history associated with \nconnotations of the number six Greek hex, Latin sex, cognate with \nEgyptian sexen, "to embrace, to copulate." Six was everywhere the \n\n\n\n400 \n\n\n\nI number of sex, representing the union between the Triple Goddess and Hexagram \n\nI her trident-bearing consort, which is why Christian authorities called \n\nsix "the number of sin." \' Pythagoreans on the contrary called six the ^^_^^_^_^_ \n\nperfect number, or The Mother. One of its Egyptian forms seshemu, \nj "sexual intercourse" shown in hieroglyphics by male and female \nj genitals in conjunction survived in the Sufi love-charm designed to \n\niopen the "cave" of the Goddess: Open, Sesame. 2 \nTo this day, hex signs are hexagonal like the six-pointed Tantric \n, yantra of love (see Hexagram). The name of the sign is from \nGerman Hexen, "witches," who may have been so named because they \n"made the six." \n\nA triple six, 666, was the magic number of Triple Aphrodite (or \nIshtar) in the guise of the Fates. The Book of Revelation called it \n"the number of the Beast" (Revelation 13:18), apparently the Beast \nwith Two Backs, the androgyne of carnal love. Solomon the wizard- \nking made a sacred marriage with the Goddess and acquired a mystic \n666 talents of gold (1 Kings 10:14). Christians usually called it \nSatan\'s number, yet the recurrences of this number in esoteric traditions \nare often surprising. For example, the maze at Chartres Cathedral \nwas planned so as to be exactly 666 feet long. 5 \n\nEgyptians considered 3, 6, and 7 the most sacred numbers. Three \nstood for the Triple Goddess; six meant her union with the God; \nseven meant the Seven Hathors, seven planetary spheres, seven-gated \nholy city, seven-year reigns of kings, etc. Egyptians had an abiding \nconviction that the total number of all deities must be exactly 37, \nbecause of this number\'s magic properties. Not only did it combine \nthe sacred 3 and 7, but 37 multiplied by any multiple of 3 gave a triple \ndigit or "trinity": 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, etc. The miraculous \nnumber 666 is a product of 3 X 6 X 37. 4 \n\n1.

Actually, the \n\nhexagram had nothing to do with either David or Solomon. It was \n\nnot mentioned in Jewish literature until the 12th century a.d., and was \n\nnot adopted as a Jewish emblem until the 17th century. 1 Hexagram \n\nThe real history of the hexagram began with Tantric Hinduism, \nwhere it represented union of the sexes. 2 The downward-pointing \ntriangle was the Female Primordial Image or Yoni Yantra, existing \nfore the universe. In the course of infinite time, the Goddess \nnceived a spark of life within her triangle, the bindu, which was \n\n\n\n# \n\n\n\n401 \n\n\n\nHexagram eventually born and developed into a male, symbolized by the \n\nupward-pointing triangle. He united with his Mother to form the Primal \n\n^^h^^^^^mhm Androgyne. 3 The sign of this union was the hexagram, called Sri \n\nYantra or Great Yantra. "The downward-pointing triangle is a female \nsymbol corresponding to the yoni; it is called \'shakti.\' The upward- \npointing triangle is the male, the lingam, and is called \'the fire\' \n(vahni)." 4 \n\nA personification of the Great Yantra was Bindumati, "Mother of \nthe Bindu," described in myth as a divine harlot. She ruled the forces \nof nature. She could command storms by the power of her magic and \nhalt rivers in their tracks, a miracle copied by several holy men in \nEgyptian myth, and later by Moses. \n\nFrom the Tantric image of the sexual hexagram arose a Jewish \nsystem of sex worship connected with the medieval Cabala, and a \nrabbinical tradition that "a picture is supposed to be placed in the ark of \nthe covenant alongside of the tables of the laws, which shows a man \nand a woman in intimate embrace, in the form of a hexagram." 5 \n\nThe Cabala was developed by the Jews of Moorish Spain after the \ncrusades brought eastern Goddess worship into their ken. Cabalists \nused the hexagram as Tantric yogis used it, to represent the union of \nGod with his Female Power, Shekina, the Jewish form of Shakti-Kali. \nAs Shakti was the essential soul of any Hindu god, so Shekina was the \nessential soul of the Cabalistic God. As in all religions of the Divine \nMarriage, Cabalistic Judaism discovered man and woman to be earthly \nimages of God and Goddess; and sexual union of mortals naturally \nencouraged its like in the supernatural realm. Therefore sexual inter- \ncourse was "a sacramental act in the service of a God and his consort \n(or perhaps vice versa: a Goddess and her consort)." 6 \n\nThe Zohar identified Shekina with Torah, "the law," as the older \nGnostic Goddess was identified with her own virgin form Maat, "the \nlaw" or "Truth." A man aspiring to mystic wisdom had to become a \n"bridegroom of Torah," for the law was embodied in a maiden, like \nthe enlightening lady-love of contemporary bardic romance, which was \nalso inspired by eastern Goddess-worship. \n\nFor the Torah resembles a beautiful and stately damsel, who is hidden in a \nsecluded chamber of her palace. . . . She opens the door of her hidden \nchamber ever so little, and for a moment reveals her face to her lover, but \nhides it again forthwith. . . . He alone sees it and he is drawn to her with \nhis heart and soul and his whole being. . . . When he comes to her, she \nbegins from behind a curtain to speak words in keeping with his \nunderstanding, until very slowly insight comes to him. 7 \n\nThe hexagram stood for the complete union of the sage with \nShekina-Torah. Attribution of the hexagram to Solomon as the magic \n"Solomon\'s Seal" probably arose from the popular view of Solomon, \n\n\n\n402 \n\n\n\ns enlightened by a sacred marriage, suggested by the erotic love poetry Hierophant \n\nIf Solomon\'s Song in the Bible. \n\n\n\nI.

The Great Hind she personified was Kore- \nDiana, Mother of Animals, ancestral Goddess of her tribe. \n\n\n\nHippolytus, Saint \n\nOne of the pseudo-saints, based on a pagan god worshipped in both \nGreece and Rome as a dying-and-resurrected savior. Originally he died \nas a surrogate for King Theseus, who retained his throne by sacrific- \ning "sons" who received the title of Hippolytus, "Torn by Horses." The \nmanner of sacrifice was that the victim was dragged to death by \nchariot horses, a rite apparently initiated in Athens by Theseus\'s Cretan \nqueen, Phaedra. Myth says Hippolytus\'s horses were frightened into \ntheir fatal stampede by a Bull from the Sea, actually a title of the Cretan \nhigh priest whose totemic form was the Minotaur. \n\nHippolytus was called the son of the Amazon queen, who embod- \nied the spirit of Artemis-Diana. The Roman Hippolytus was slain and \nresurrected in Diana\'s sacred grove of Nemi. He was apotheosized and \nraised to heaven as the constellation Auriga, the Charioteer. 1 He \nmarried the Goddess\'s virgin aspect, the nymph Egeria. He was reborn \nlike all cyclic gods as his own son, Virbius, "the Virile One." Virbius \ntoo was slain by horses in his turn. \n\n"We can hardly doubt," says Frazer, "that the Saint Hippolytus of \nthe Roman Calendar, who was dragged by horses to death on the \nthirteenth of August, Diana\'s own day, is no other than the Greek hero \nof the same name, who, after dying twice over as a heathen sinner, \nhas been happily resuscitated as a Christian saint." 2 \n\nA number of theological writings were brought forth under the \nsignature of St. Hippolytus, whose "life" was assigned to the 3rd \ncentury a.d. The likelihood is that all these works were forged at a later 1 \ndate and arbitrarily given a canonical authorship, as was the custom of \nthe early church. 3 \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1, 358. 2.

Some myths say Hod was really another name for Odin, who \nwas blind or half-blind; for Odin contrived the death of his divine son \nBalder, much as Yahweh contrived that of his divine son Jesus. \nChristians claimed Jesus was pierced by a spear wielded by a blind man, \nSt. Longinus. Probably Hod was a title of the high priest in charge of \nsacrificial killings, embodying Odin\'s spirit. 1 He may even have been \nblindfolded or put into an eyeless mask, the Helmet of Darkness \n(Tarnhelm), to enact the sacred drama as a deadly game of Blind Man\'s \nBuff. \n\nl.Turville-Petre, 113-18. \n\n\n\nHofgydja \n\n"Priestess of the Temple," Norse title of clan mothers who had \ncharge of religious rites up to the 1 1th century a.d., when Christian \nmissionaries began to oust women from their shrines. 1 Women \ncarried on their traditional festivals in private, as "witches." \n\nl.Turville-Petre. 261. \n\n\n\nHokmah \n\n\'Wisdom," the Hebrew version of the Gnostic Goddess known in \nLatin as Sapientia, in Greek as Sophia. Her name was only a title of the \nGreat Mother who actively helped God create the world, according \n\n\n\n\n\n\n405 \n\n\n\nHolly to Proverbs 8, and whose symbol was the Aphroditean dove later \n\nadopted by Christians as a sign of the Holy Ghost. Much of the \n\nm mmm m |^ mm Jewish "Wisdom literature" owed its origin to ancient Oriental and \nEgyptian sources in which the Goddess was supposed to have \ninspired clear thinking on all matters of morality and religion. 1 There- \nfore Hokmah closely resembled Isis. Her praises were inserted into \nthe mouth of Solomon, one of her most renowned lovers, by the author \nof the Wisdom of Solomon: \n\nHer bright shining is never laid to sleep. But with her there came to me all \ngood things together. . . . And I rejoiced over them all because [Hok- \nmah] leadeth them; though I knew not that she was the mother of them. . . . \nShe that is the artificer of all things . . . there is in her a spirit quick of \nunderstanding, holy, alone in kind, manifold, subtle, freely moving . . . all- \npowerful, all-surveying, and penetrating through all spirits. . . . Yea, she \npervadeth and penetrateth all things. . . . And she, though but one, hath \npower to do all things; and remaining in herself, reneweth all things. . . . \nFor she is fairer than the sun, and above all the constellations of the stars; \nbeing compared with light, she is found to be before it. . . . She \nreacheth out from one end of the world to the other with full strength, and \nordereth all things well. 2 \n\nIt may be that the Hebrew name of Hokmah was also of \nEgyptian origin, after an ancient title of Isis as Heq-Maa, Mother of \nMagical Knowledge, dating back to the heq or tribal wise-woman of \npre-dynastic times. The Goddess as Heqit, Hekat, and the Greek \nderivative Hecate (the Wise Crone) can be traced to the same \nsources. \n\n1. Encyc. Brit, "Wisdom Literature." 2. Barrett, 143, 218-19. \n\n\n\nHolly \n\nTo the druids, holly was the plant of death and regeneration, sacred \nto Mother Holle, or Hel, the underworld Goddess. 1 Germanic witches \nwho worshipped her favored holly wood for magic wands. Red holly \nberries showed the female blood-of-life color, corresponding to white \nmistletoe berries associated with male elements of semen and death. \nIn the divine marriage celebrated at Yule, they were displayed together. \n\nThe "holy" holly was linguistically linked with Hel\'s yonic "hole" \n(Germanic Hohle, a cave or grave). It was the most sacred of trees, \naccording to a carol sung by medieval pagans at Yuletide, saying holly \n"bears the crown." 2 \n\nIn the Dionysian cult, female holly was paired with the god\'s male \nsymbol, ivy. ? Green boughs of both were used to adorn doorways at \nthe solstitial festival. Tertullian condemned the custom, saying any \nChristian who has "renounced temples" should not make a temple of \nhis own house door. 4 Nevertheless, house-decorating with holly, ivy, or \nmistletoe at the solstitial festival went serenely on. The Council of \n\n\n\n406 \n\n\n\nBracara ruled that no Christian should bring holly into his house for \nChristmas, because it was a custom of "heathen people." 5 Heathen \njor not, it was inextricably linked with Yuletide celebrations and could \nnot be eradicated. \n\nEven the sexual symbolism of the holly was remembered, in a way, \nup to the 17th century. Christmas games included a mock battle of \nthe sexes, in which the master and mistress of the house engaged: \n"Great is the contention of holly and ivy, whether master or dame \nwears the breeches." 6 The kiss under the mistletoe originally represent- \ned sexual union, a peaceful resolution of the battle. \n\n1.

In Asia \nMinor from 3500 to 1750 b.c. the dead were embalmed in honey \nand placed in fetal position in burial vases or pithoi, ready for rebirth. \n\'To fall into a jar of honey" became a common metaphor for "to \nlie." \' The pithos represented the womb of the Goddess under her \nlame of Pandora, "All-giver," and honey became her sacred essence. \n\nMyths present many symbolic assurances that the Goddess would \nestore life to the dead through her magic "bee-balm." Worshippers \n)f Demeter called her "the pure mother bee," and at her Thesmo- \nDhoria festivals displayed honey-cakes shaped like female genitals. \nThe symbol of Aphrodite at Eryx was a golden honeycomb. 2 Her \n)riestess bore the name of Melissa, "Queen Bee," the same as the \newish Queen Deborah, priestess of Asherah, whose name also meant \n*bee." 3 \n\n\n\nThe bee was rightly looked upon as a symbol of the feminine potency of \nnature. . . . In the Syracusan Thesmophoria, the participants carried \nmylloi, cakes made of honey and sesame in the shape of the female sex \norgan. . . . Menzel draws an apt parallel between this custom and the \nHindu usage of daubing the woman \'s genitals with honey at the marriage \nfeast. 4 \n\n\n\nBees are still called hymenoptera, "veil-winged, after the hy- \nnen or veil that covered the inner sanctum of the Goddess\'s temples, \nhe veil having its physical counterpart in women\'s bodies. Deflora- \nion was a ritual penetration of the veil under the "hymeneal" rules of \nhe Goddess, herself entitled Hymen in the character of patroness of \nhe wedding night and "honey-moon." \n\nThe honeymoon spanned a lunar month, usually in May, the \nnonth of pairings, named after the Goddess as the Virgin Maya. 5 In \nin archaic period, sacred kings seem to have been destroyed after a 28- \nlay honeymoon with the Goddess, spanning a lunar cycle, as the \n\n\n\nBracara Modern \nBraga, in northern \nPortugal, first settled \nby Romans under the \nname of Bracara \nAugusta. An early- \nchurch council was \nheld there in 563 a.d. \n\n\n\n407 \n\n\n\nHope, Saint \n\n\n\nPorphyry (ca. 234- \n305 a.d.) Neoplatonist \nphilosopher, scholar, \nand writer; biographer \nof Plotinus; an \nopponent of the \nChristian church, \nwhich eventually \ndestroyed most of his \nbooks. \n\n\n\nqueen bee destroys her drone-bridegroom by tearing out his genitals. 6 \n\nAs applied to ordinary weddings rather than sacrificial dramas, the \nhoneymoon of a lunar month would include a menstrual period, the \nreal source of what was euphemistically called moon-honey. A bride- \ngroom contacted the source of life by copulating with his bride during \nmenstruation, according to the oldest Oriental belief. Even the Great \nGod Shiva was helpless unless his phallus was baptized in blood from \nthe vagina of Kali-Maya, his Shakti and mother, in the Tantric ritual \nknown as Maharutti. 7 \n\nA combination of honey and menstrual blood was once consid- \nered the universal elixir of life, the "nectar" manufactured by \nAphrodite and her sacred bees, which kept the very gods alive. Similarly, \nthe great secret of Norse mythology was that the gods\' nectar of \nwisdom, inspiration, literacy, magic, and eternal life was a combination \nof honey and "wise blood" from the great Cauldron in the belly of \nMother Earth though a late patriarchal revision claimed this hydromel \nor "honey-liquid" was a mixture of honey with the blood of a male \nsacrificial victim known as Wisest of Men. 8 \n\nEven the most patriarchal cults seemed unable to dispense with the \nlife-giving feminine fluids. Celibate priests of Mithra, who excluded \nwomen from their temples, nevertheless worshipped the Moon-goddess \nDiana or Luna who "made the honey which was used in the \npurifications." 9 Of course it was the Moon-goddess who also made the \n"wise blood" of female lunar cycles. Porphyry reported a popular \nbelief in his day that bees were reincarnations of the lunar nymphs. 10 \n\nFinnish myth speaks of the hero Lemminkainen, torn to pieces like \na sacrificial victim and sent to Manala, the underground realm of the \ndeath-goddess Mana. His own mother restored him to life with her \nmagic honey, assisted by her familiar spirit, Mehilainen the Bee. 11 \n\nEarly Christian Ophites celebrated a Tantric-style "love feast" \nwhich included the tasting of menstrual blood, and it was said of them 1 \nthat they mingled blood with honey. 12 Thus they combined two of the \nthree substances the third being salt most often associated with \nresurrection or rebirth. \n\nI.

Zeus sent the \nvase full of Spites to plague humanity with vice, madness, sickness, hard \nlabor, war, famine, and every other ill; he also enclosed Hope, whose i \n\n\n\n408 \n\n\n\nfunction was to prevent men from killing themselves in despair, to \nkscape the miseries Zeus decreed for them. 1 \n\nHope was thus presented as a spirit of delusion; her ultimate \npurpose was to make men suffer. In Christian scriptures however, she \nIvas combined with Faith and Charity (or Love) as one of the three \nessential virtues. Some excessively naive hagiographers even canon- \nized these three virtues as three fictitious virgin martyrs, all daughters of \nhe equally fictitious St. Sophia. 2 St. Hope is still listed in the Roman \npanon of saints even though scholars have shown that she never existed. \n\n1.

The dance still \npilled hora was based on the priestesses\' imitation of the zodiacal \n(circling of "hours." Time-keeping is horology because of the systems \nDevised by these ancient priestesses of the Goddess. See Prostitution. \niThe Horae were called "fair ones, begetters of all things, who in \nAppointed order bring on day and night, summer and winter, so as to \nJnake months and years grow full." \' \n\n1. Jonas, 258. \n\n\n\nIn Egypt they were \n"Ladies of the Hour," \nin Persia houris, in \nBabylon harines; among \nSemites they were \nthe "whores" called hor \n(a hole), ancestresses \nof the Horites. \n\n\n\nHorns \n\nPerhaps the most distinguishing feature of a divine being used to be a \nlorned head. Masks and crowns of incarnate deities were often those of \nlorned animals bulls, goats, stags. Horns were connected with the \nBldest Tantric belief concerning male vitality: that by suppression of \njjaculation, mystic energy mounts up the spine to the head and \n/ers forth in wisdom and magic power, made visible by horns. \n\nOutgrowths from the head are specially significant. The horned animals \nare the most sacred, because they carry about upon them visible \nevidence that their "head-stuff\' is developed to the point of extrusion. \nBulls, rams and he-goats are especially well-endowed. So too are deer. \nThere is ample linguistic evidence in the West for the association between \nhorns and male sexuality. In Indian miniatures and ivories of the \nseventeenth and eighteenth century A.D. horned deer are frequently used \nas symbols for the desire of a lovely girl in the forest. \' \n\nThe Bible says Yahweh\'s altar was horned, and he was some- \nImes addressed as a phallic stone, "the Rock that begat thee," as well as \nlie phallic "horn of my salvation, my high tower" (2 Samuel 22:3). \nlahweh was identified with El, "supreme god of the Semitic pantheon" \n\n\n\n409 \n\n\n\nHorns \n\n\n\nSir Thomas \n\nBrowne (1605-1682) \nEnglish physician, \nauthor of the famous \nReJigio Medici and \nother works. \n\n\n\nwho wore bull-horns as consort of Mari-Asherah the divine cow. 2 \nLike Zeus and Apis, he could take the form of the white moon-bull, \nprobably copied from totemic incarnations of Shiva as the white bull \nNandi (Blessed One). \n\nThe white moon-bull seems to have been one of the forms of the \nmoon god Sin, whose holy Mount Sinai Moses climbed, and came \ndown "wearing horns" in token of his encounter with the god of the \nmountain. The standard biblical translation says Moses came down \nfrom Sin\'s mountain with his head "shining," but in Hebrew, the same \nword signifies a "horned" or a "radiated" head. 5 The Vulgate says \ncornuta fuit fades ejus, he (Moses) wore horns. Michelangelo\'s famous \nfigure of Moses is horned like a satyr. 4 \n\nThe Horned God was as old as the Stone Age. Primitive sacred art \neverywhere shows men wearing the horns of bulls, stags, rams, or \ngoats, which distinguished the shaman, sacred king, priest, or victim. 5 \nHorned animals were frequently associated with Mother Goddess \nfigures. 6 Myths of all later periods also combined the Goddess with the \nHorned God, who was Actaeon the stag, Pan the goat, Dionysus or \nZeus the bull, Amen the ram, and innumerable combinations of these \nwith human images. The Teutonic hero Sigurd or Siegfried was \nsometimes a man, sometimes a hart, consort of the White Hind who led \nmen on mysterious adventures. He found his mother-bride in the \nform of a Valkyrie sleeping in her secret place, Hinderfjall (Hind- \nMountain). 7 Later he died in the forest as a hunted stag, pierced by \narrows, like Actaeon the Lord of the Hunt and his medieval counter- \npart, the witches\' Horned God. \n\nMedieval folk thought it might be possible for human beings to \ngrow real horns on their heads for a variety of reasons, from telling \nlies (through identification with the devil as Father of Lies) to becoming \na cuckold. Agrippa von Nettesheim offered a pseudo-scientific \nexplanation for the alleged overnight horning of Cyprus, king of Italy. \nThe king dreamed all night of a battle of bulls, which stimulated "the \nvegetative power, being stirred up by a vehement imagination, elevating \ncomific humors into his head and producing horns." 8 \n\nOf course the principal Horned God was the devil, a composite of \nall the Horned Gods of paganism. Sir Thomas Browne said the \n"devils" of holy scripture were Fauns, Satyrs, and sons of Pan; but the \noriginal Hebrew word for them was "goats." 9 In Scotland, the devil \nwas known as Ould Hornie. His notorious lustfulness gave rise to the \nmodern slang term "horny." The so-called sign of the devil \nforefinger and little finger extended was originally a gesture-symbol of \na horned animal head, copied from a sacred mudra of the Great \nGoddess in India. 10 \n\n1.

Out of a Christian \nprejudice against queens, the Venerable Bede insisted that the \nStallion and Mare were really two brothers ruling jointly, but he never \nexplained how they managed to become joint parents. 4 \n\nSymbolic of the equine deities was a double-headed androgynous \nhorse still used to decorate the double projecting rafters of old houses \nin Jutland, the original home of the Jutes. Such figures are known as \nHengist and Horsa and are put up for "luck." 5 \n\nAnother relic of pre-Christian horse worship is the Morris dancer\'s \ntraditional horse-headed stick, or "hobby horse" otherwise the \ncock-horse ridden to Banbury Cross to see the Goddess make her ritual \nride as Lady Codiva. Similar horse-headed sticks were ridden by \ncentral Asian shamans. "The \'horse\' enables the shaman to fly through \nthe air, to reach the heavens. The dominant aspect of the mythology \nof the horse is not infernal but funerary; the horse is a mythical image of \ndeath and hence is incorporated into the ideologies and techniques of \necstasy." 6 Death symbolism figured in the dream of riding a black \nhorse, interpreted as a portent of "loss and sorrow." 7 \n\nNorthern Europeans considered horses essential to the funeral \nrites of great warriors. The riderless horse led in a pagan or Christian \nmilitary officer\'s funeral procession dated back to primitive belief that his \nghost needed to ride to heaven. His empty boots were often fixed \nbackward in the stirrups because it was thought ghosts wore their feet \nbackward. In ancient times, the horse was usually sacrificed at the \nfuneral and buried with the dead hero, just as boats were buried with \nEgyptian mummies to carry them over afterworld waters. 8 \n\nDeath was the significance of Father Odin\'s eight-legged gray \nhorse Sleipnir, symbol of the gallows tree, where human sacrifices \nwere hung in Odin\'s sacred groves. Skalds called the gallows "high- \nchested rope-Sleipnir," the horse on which men rode to the land of \ndeath, Heljar. Recounting Odin\'s own death-and-resurrectiop drama, \nthe original nine-day wonder, the Elder Edda said: "In the Norn\'s \n\n\n\n411 \n\n\n\nHorse seat nine days sat I, thence was I mounted on a horse; there the \n\ngiantess\'s sun shone grimly through the dripping clouds of heaven. \n^hh^^^^h^^h Without and within, I seemed to traverse all the seven nether worlds." 9 \n\nOld Norse drasil meant both "horse" and "gallows tree." 10 There \nfore the World Tree Yggdrasil, on which Odin hung and bled, was \nboth the Horse of Yggr and the Gallows of Yggr, as well as the axis \nmundial the earth\'s hub. Yggr was another name for Odin as Lord of \nDeath. When Christians diabolized him, he became the great devil- \nrider leading the hosts of the dead through the sky on their \ncloud-colored horses, and Yggr evolved into the English "ogre." " \n\nThe horse cult of Odin\'s Aesir was rooted in Vedic India. Hind \ndying gods often assumed horse shape. Hindu queens impersonated \nthe Goddess as Mare-mother, Saranyu, by inserting the dead horse\'s \npenis between their legs at the end of the sacrificial ceremony, calling \nupon "the vigorous male" to "lay seed" for the benefit of the land and \nits people. 12 \n\nThis ancient ceremony explains one of Odin\'s more puzzling \ntitles, Volsi, meaning both "Son of God" and "Horse\'s Penis." 13 \nThe penis was the "son" worshipped by Iron Age equestrian tribes \ncalling themselves Volsungs, descendants of Volsi. The cult was not \nconfined to Scandinavia. The Welsh had the same ancestral horse-goc \nWaelsi or Waels. Slavs also worshipped him as Volos, a sacrificed \nhorse whose entrails and blood were supposed to produce the water of \nlife. In a Russian folk tale, Volos directed the hero to use him for \nresurrection magic: "Open my body, take out my entrails, rub the dead \nman with my blood." H This was supposed to restore life to the dead. \n\nVolos was still incarnated in a ritually castrated and slaughtered \nstallion every spring, up to the 18th century a.d. 15 Since the people \ninsisted on worshipping him, he was converted into a Christian saint, \nVlas, who had no real existence except as a pagan horse-god. \n\nAncient Rome knew him as the October Horse, or curtus equus \n("cut horse"). By an elaborate ritual, the animal was divided into \nthree sections by sacred women known as the Three Queens. After \nslaughtering, the horse\'s amputated tail was carried hastily to the \ntemple of Vesta the earth\'s yoni, by Roman reckoning so its bloo \ncould drip on the altar. 16 In earlier times it probably was the horse\'s \npenis that donated its blood to the Goddess, as in the rites of Saranyu I \nand Volsi. Castrated stallions were offered to all equine forms of the \nGoddess. The Taurians sacrificed to Artemis horses from whom "the j \nmember was cut off." I7 \n\nThe blood-wedding of the Earth Mother and the Horse\'s Penis \nproduced the race of horse-gods known in the Aegean as centaurs, in \nIndia as Asvins or Gandharvas. 18 They were great wizards, skilled in \nmusic and dancing, expert healers, lusty lovers of women. They often \nstole brides from their bridegrooms, a legend reminiscent of the ancien \n\n\n\n412 \n\n\n\nDriental custom of having brides deflowered by priests or god-penises Horse \n\nnstead of by their husbands (see Firstborn). 19 \n\nWestern centaurs were similar, born of Mare-headed Demeter in ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nMycenae, or of Leukippe the White Mare in Crete. 20 Priests of this \ngoddess were castrated and wore female dress. 21 Sometimes they were \nailed Magnetes, "Great Ones." One of their leaders was the magic \nlorse Arion, born of Demeter\'s union as a mare with the sea god in the \n: orm of a stallion. 22 A sacred grove in Chios called Tripotamara \n"Three Streams) is said to be still haunted by ghostly centaur-wizards. 23 \n\nGreeks called Corinthian horse-priestesses "man-eating mares," \nilso known as the horse-masked Pegae guarding the sacred fountain \njf Pirene, home of Pegasus another name for Arion, the horse who \n:arried heroes to heaven. The Pegae-priestesses killed Bellerophon \nmd his father, a typical father-son combination of the reborn deity. \nDiodorus compared the orgies of the Pegae to those of the Egyptian \n>ull-god Apis, whose priestesses tore him apart and directed his spurting \nJood onto their genitals to fertilize themselves on behalf of their \nGoddess, the ea>th. 24 \n\nCustoms of the Cretan horse cult produced the myth of Hippoly- \ntus (He Who is Torn by Horses), dragged to death by his chariot \nporses after receiving a curse from his father Theseus. The myth \nconcealed a primitive sacrifice, though Hippolytus was eventually \ncanonized as a Christian saint. 25 In his Christian form, Hippolytus was \nBragged to death by horses on the Goddess\'s holy day in August. 26 \nborne said Demeter\'s Cretan lover Iasion was similarly torn to pieces by \nnorses. 27 \n\nAncient kings of Sweden were torn to pieces by horse- Valkyries or \nlorse-masked priestesses of Freya, known as volvas. 28 Medieval \nolklore redefined a volva as a witch able to transform herself into a \nnare. She embodied the spirit of the Scandinavian death-goddess \nvho rode a winged black horse known as the Valraven (Raven-ridden- \ny- Valkyries). 29 Slavs used to pray to her as the virgin battle-queen \nDiana, Athene, Bellona, etc.) before setting forth to war: "Unsheathe, \np Virgin, the sacred sword of thy father, take up the breastplate of \ntiy ancestors, thy doughty helmet, bring out thy black horse." 30 \n\nThe myth of King Midas and his ass-ears was dressed in Celtic \nhrb for transposition to an Irish horse cult centering on King Lavra \np. 3rd century a.d.). The king was said to have horse\'s ears, a fact \nmown only to his barber until the barber whispered the secret to a \nJ/illow tree. The willow was cut down and made into a harp, and the \nlarp sang the truth about the king\'s ears. 31 \n\nHorse sacrifices were performed in Norway in the 10th century \nLd. despite the efforts of newly converted Christian kings to discon- \n\nInue them. King Haakon\'s rebellious subjects not only continued the \nagan feasts of horsemeat but forced the king himself to take part in \n\n\n\n413 \n\n\n\nHorse! them and drink toasts to the old gods meanwhile. 32 \n\nHorseshoe Traces of the horse sacrifice persisted in England up to the 16th \n\n^^^^^^^^ m ^ m century, when it was still customary for all horses to be bled on St. \n\nStephen\'s Day, the day after Christmas, for "luck." " The New Year \nsacrifice of a white horse-image known as Old Hob was the same \n"hobby-horse" as Germany\'s Schimmel, made of a horse head animat- \ned by young men covered by white cloths. In Pomerania the New \nYear hobby-horse performer Schimmeheiter pantomimed ancient sacri- \nficial dances. 34 Christian opposition to pagan horse sacrifices probably \ngave rise to the strong prejudice against eating horsemeat. 35 \n\nI.

Her many lovers included Tannhauser in Germany and \nThomas Rhymer (Thomas of Ercel\'s Down) in England. Accord- \ning to the Thuringian Chronicle, she appeared as a fiery trinity in 1 398, \nas "three great fires in the air" descending to rest in the Horselberg. 1 \nEventually the Goddess Horsel was canonized as the apocryphal St. \nUrsula, with her "eleven thousand virgins" transformations of the \nMoon-mother and her daughter stars. \n1. Baring-Gould, C.M.M.A., 211. \n\n\n\nHorseshoe \n\nHindus, Arabs, and Celts regarded the yonic shape of the horseshoe \nas a symbol of the Goddess\'s "Great Gate," thus it was always esteemed \nas a prophylactic door charm. Druidic temples were constructed in \nthe shape of a horseshoe. 1 So were some Hindu temples, with the frank \nintention of representing the yoni. The horseshoe arch of Arabic \nsacred architecture developed from the same tradition. 2 \n\nGreeks assigned the yonic shape to the last letter of their sacred \nalphabet, Omega, literally, "Great Om," the Word of Creation \nbeginning the next cycle of becoming. The implication of the horseshoe \nsymbol was that, having entered the yonic Door at the end of life \n(Omega), man would be reborn as a new child (Alpha) through the \n\n\n\n414 \n\n\n\nsame Door. It was everywhere represented as "a horseshoe, the very Hortus Conclusus \n\nfigure that is nailed to so many doors in various parts of the world, as an Horus \n\nemblem of luck. Mighty few of those who live in such houses know ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthat the horseshoe is only a symbol of the yoni and that by nailing it to \ntheir doors, they follow out a custom older than the history of their \nrace." 3 \n\nThe Christian God who claimed to be the "Alpha and Omega" \n(Revelation 1:8) was only copying one version of this very ancient \nsymbolism, whose meaning seems not to have been understood by the \nbiblical writer. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 315-16. 2. de Lys, 113. 3. Goldberg, 102. \n\n\n\nHortus Conclusus \n\n"Enclosed Garden," a symbol of the Virgin, whose garden was called \nParadise and mythologically related to the womb. Virginity meant the \nfeminine "gate of paradise" was not yet opened. In the erotic \nmetaphors of Solomon\'s wedding song, the virgin bride as yet un- \ndeflowered is not only a hortus conclusus but "a spring shut up, a \nfountain sealed" (Song of Solomon 4:12). In medieval art, the virgin \nMary was mystically depicted inside a walled garden representing her \nvirginity. 1 \n\n1. Hughes, 55. \n\n\n\nHorus \n\nEgyptian Divine Child, or reborn sun; a son-reincarnation of either \nRa or Osiris, or both. Horus was depicted as a child with a long lock of \nnair curled to one side of his head and a finger in his mouth, signifying \n:hildlike dependence. 1 Yet he was also a warrior, avenging his \nfather" or elder-self Osiris by castrating and killing Set, the god of the \nbarren half of the year. \n\nSome said there was a Horus the Elder, born of Isis immediately \nifter her own birth, for he was conceived by the coupling of Isis and \nler twin-brother-spouse Osiris while they were still in the womb of their \nnother Mut. Other myths said Horus was the world\'s firstborn sun, \nvho arose from the primal Mother\'s lotus-yoni at the beginning of \nime. 2 \n\nHorus might be traced to the Far East, as the "Lotus-born" \nperuka, or hero; the original Egyptian form of his name was Hem. \nJreek Gnostics of the philosophical age called him Harpocrates. What- \nver his name, he was another variation on the usual theme of the \nying-and-reborn god, father-killing son and son-killing father. \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 1, 484. 2.

Bread \nplayed "host" to the visiting spirit of the deity, and became one with \nthe body of the worshipper upon being eaten. See Cannibalism; \nTransubstantiation. Another derivative of hostia was "hostage," a \nsurrogate; and if not ransomed, a victim. \n\n\n\nHouri \n\nPersian-Arabian heavenly nymph, sexual angel, or temple prostitute; \ncognate with the Greek hora, Babylonian harine, Semitic harlot, or \n"whore." Houris were dancing "Ladies of the Hour" who kept time \nin heaven and tended the star-souls. See Angel; Prostitution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHsi Wang Mu \n\n"Lady-Queen of the West," Chinese Great Mother who kept the \nfruit of immortality in a magic orchard in the Far West, as did Idun, \nPomona, Hera, Morgan, etc. Instead of apples, Hsi Wang Mu raised \npeaches, the Chinese symbol of the yoni. Once every 3000 years she \ngave the gods peaches from her Tree of Life. \' See Peach. \n\n1. Larousse, 382. \n\n\n\nHubris \n\nGreek "lechery," or "pride," both words associated with penile \nerection; said to be the sin of Lucifer. Patriarchal gods especially \npunished hubris, the sin of any upstart who became in both \nsenses "too big for his breeches." \' \n\nThe original Hubristika was an Argive "Feast of Lechery" featur- \ning orgies and transvestism. Men broke a specific taboo by wearing \nwomen\'s veils and assuming women\'s magic power. 2 Christianity later \ncondemned as devil-worship all forms of transvestism, because of its \nimplication that men acquired power through connection with women, \nwhether it was a sexual connection or a masquerade. \n\nFrom hubrizein, lecherous behavior, came the Roman word \nhybrid, describing a child of a Roman father and a foreign mother. A \ntrace of the old law of matrilineal inheritance dictated that a child was a \nslave or a freeman according to the status of his mother, slave or free; \nthe father\'s status was irrelevant. Similarly among the Jews, in the case \n\n\n\n416 \n\n\n\nof mixed marriages or hybridization, a child was Jewish only if the \nTiother was the Jewish parent, but gentile if only the father was Jewish. 3 \n\n1.

All \n\nhe savior-gods in these cults were castrated. See Castration; \n\nTransvestism. \n\nl.Gaster,317. \n\n\n\n-luppah \n\niebrew "tent," the marriage canopy held above the heads of a bride \nnd groom in a Jewish wedding, a custom derived from the ancient \ntemitic matriarchate when women owned their tents, and a wedding \neremony was in effect a solemnization of the man\'s permission to enter \nle tent of his beloved. 1 The tent and the land it occupied were \nembolic of the woman herself. Before the development of patriarchal \nJes, she had complete control of her property. An Arabian wife \nould divorce her husband without speaking a word, simply by turning \ner tent to face the other direction, which let him know he was \n>rbidden to enter the door again. 2 \n\nWhen Absalom tried to establish a right to rule Israel, he raised \nan awning on a housetop" and beneath its shade he copulated with \n!ing David\'s royal concubines "in the sight of all Israel" (2 Samuel \n6:22). Without this rite of sacred marriage, no man could be a king, \nbsalom\'s followers erected the customary phallic pillar in his name, to \nanor his virility after he died as a surrogate for the king (2 Samuel \n8:18). \n\nThe huppah was not unknown as an accompaniment to Gentile \ncarriages. Anglo-Saxon weddings similarly took place "under a veil \n\' square piece of cloth, held at each corner by a tall man, over the \nidegroom and bride." 4 The veil seems to have symbolized the \nOman\'s dwelling place, for early Anglo-Saxon marriages were \natrilocal. \n\n: 1 .

Mar- \nriage with the queen \ngave him formal \nright to rule her land, \nand the senti like the \nhuppah was a symbol of \npermission. 5 \n\n\n\n417 \n\n\n\nHusband property rights were matrilineal. A husband was not considered an \n\nintegral part of the maternal clan but remained a "stranger" in the \n^^^^^^^^^^ house, as in early Greece where the men\'s god Zeus was "god of \nstrangers." \' \n\nPre-Islamic Arabian husbands didn\'t even have names in the \nmatrilineal clan until they begot children; then a man could call \nhimself abu, "father of. . ." So-and-so. This part of an Arab\'s name is \nstill considered the most important part. 2 \n\nIn southeast India, a husband was regarded as a more or less \npermanent guest in the wife\'s home, constrained to remain on his \ngood behavior according to the rules governing guests. In archaic Japan, \nhusbands were not residents in the wife\'s home at all, but only \nvisitors. The old word for "marriage" meant "to slip into the house by \nnight." 5 Patrilocal marriage was unknown in Japan until 1400 a.d. 4 \n\nThe position of a husband in the ancient world was often tempo- \nrary, subject to summary divorce. An Arabian wife could dismiss her \nhusband by turning her tent to face the west for three nights in \nsuccession. 5 After the introduction of Islamic patriarchy, the system \nwas reversed in favor of men. A husband could turn his wife out of her \nhome simply by saying "I divorce thee" three times. \n\nEarly Latin tribes followed the same rules as Arabians; a woman \ncould divorce her husband by shutting him out of her house for three \nconsecutive nights. 6 Even in imperial times, a Roman wife could \nmaintain her own property free of husbandly claims by passing three \nnights of each year away from his residence. 7 \n\nAncient Egypt had several varieties of marriage existing side by \nside. Some, probably the oldest, were governed by premarital agree- \nments that spelled out the wife\'s property rights and the husband\'s \ncomparative powerlessness under the law. For example: \n\n/ bow before thy rights as a wife. From this day on, I shall never oppose \nthy claims with a single word. I recognize thee before all others as my \nwife, though I do not have the right to say thou must be my wife. Only I \nam thy husband and mate. Thou alone hast the right of departure. \nFrom this day on that I have become thy husband, I cannot oppose thy \nwish, wherever thou desirest to go. ... I have no power to interfere in \nany of thy transactions. I hereby cede to thee any rights deeded to me in \nany document that has been made out in my favor. Thou keepest me \nobligated to recognize all these cessions. 8 \n\nEgyptian priests advised husbands to remain in their wives\' good I \ngraces, much as Christian priests later advised wives to make themselves! \nsubservient to husbands: \n\nKeep thy house, love thy wife, and do not dispute with her. She will \nwithdraw herself before violence. Feed her, adorn her, massage her. \nCaress her and make her heart to rejoice as long as thou livest. . . . Attend] \nto that which is her desire and to that which occupies her mind. For in \nsuch manner thou persuadest her to remain with thee. If thou opposest \nher, it will be thy ruin. 9 \n\n\n\n418 \n\n\n\nAn Egyptian husband was counseled to make glad his wife\'s Hvov \n\nheart "during the time that thou hast," which might have meant a Hyacinthus \n\nlifetime on earth, or else a shorter period implying a temporary ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmarriage. 10 In the matrilocal household, husbands often entered a \nperiod of trial servitude to win their brides, as did the biblical Jacob to \nwin the hand of Rachel (Genesis 29). Hence Sophocles\'s remark that \n"Egyptian men sit indoors all day long, weaving; the women go out \nand attend to business." n \n\nSimilarly among Anglo-Saxon tribes, "husbandry" meant farm \nwork as it still does because a husband was usually bonded to \nwork on his wife\'s land. Such an agricultural matriarchate is still found \nin some areas. Among the Zuni, husbands worked in the fields, but \nthe land and its harvest belonged to their wives. 12 The old custom of \nproviding work in compensation for marriage gave rise to the word \nbridegroom, literally "the bride\'s servant." The Koran tells men, "your \nwives are your tillage," because by ancient Arabian law a wifeless \nman was also landless. 13 See Matrilineal Inheritance. \n\nTantric sages considered "husbandship" (bhavanan) essential for \nstill another reason: it was indispensable to a man\'s spiritual develop- \nment. The same notion was found among Aryan Celts. The ancient \nIrish said a true bard could have power over poetry and magic only if \nhe had "purity of husbandship," that is, fidelity to his wife. 14 \n\n1. J.E. Harrison, 519. 2.

As the gods were diabolized in the \nMiddle Ages, so was their magic blood. Ichor now means a watery \npurulent discharge, such as medieval churchmen postulated in the \nveins of devils; the word has also been applied to the blood of insects. \nSee Quintessence. \n\n\n\nIdea \n\n"Inner-Goddess." Occult tradition said an idea emanated from the \nFemale Soul of the World (Shakti, Shekina, Psyche, Sophia, etc.). Her \n"ideas" were like personal Muses, "which forms she did in the \nHeavens above the Stars frame to herself." \' \n\nMedieval theologians disliked the Idea\'s feminine connotations \nand turned away from the ancient theory of the eide to the astral \ntheology of Aristotle, that is, to astrological determination of thoughts. 2 \nFeminine "idea" was replaced by masculine "concept," which used \nto mean the same as conception, from Latin concipere semina, a \ngathering-up of semen. 3 \n\nEarly Christian Gnostics however regarded God the Creator as a \nmere demiurge, child of the Mother who created in his mind all the \n\n\n\n\n\n\n424 \n\n\n\n"ideas" he used to make things in the material world. His sin was that he \narrogantly claimed all these ideas to be his own, because "he was \nignorant of the ideas of whatever he created and of the Mother \nherself." 4 This notion that God was guilty of the sin of hubris against \nthe Goddess recurred again and again among early Gnostic sects, until \nthe orthodox church declared the notion heretical and forcibly \nchanged the minds of its adherents. \n\nl.Agrippa,65. 2.

St. Thomas Aquinas defended the church against the \nbiblical tradition, and laid down a rule that the same reverence must \nbe paid to Christ\'s image as to the deity himself. 1 \n\nThe issue of idolatry became crucial in the Protestant Reforma- \ntion, when heretic sects broke off from Catholicism, claiming that \npapal Rome no longer followed the biblical magisterium in this matter \nor any other. \n\nJohn Wyclif declared that holy images were of no use except as \nfirewood. For this reason, among others, the church insisted on \ndigging up his heretic bones 30 years after his death and burning them. 2 \n\nSome Protestant sects, like the Socinians, argued that if Catholics \ncould be saved despite their disobedience of God\'s clear command \nagainst idolatry, then Protestants could be saved also, though they \ndenied other papal doctrines such as the trinity and the eternity of \ndamnation. In renouncing idolatry, they claimed to be following the \nletter of biblical law more closely than the Roman church did. 3 \n\nOne reason for renunciation of idols was the fear that people \nwould cease to be suitably impressed by them, for after the decline of \nRoman culture holy images became less and less impressive. Lacking \nthe artistic skill and training that had flourished under paganism, \nChristian image-makers were unable to produce anything comparable \nto the classical sculptures and paintings. They created only the \ncrudest sort of painted wooden figures or icons. 4 \n\nImages, no matter how venerable, failed to arouse the proper \nreverence when their cracks showed, their paint chipped, or the \nawkward technique of a mediocre artist too obviously proclaimed a \nman-made artifact devoid of inspiration. As the Chinese proverb said, \nNo image-maker worships the gods he knows what stuff they are \nmade of." 5 So did everyone else know, in the case of crudely \n:nceived idols. Some, however, succeeded in fooling the credulous \nfaithful for a long time. Boxley Monastery near Maidstone attracted \n\n\n\nJohn Wyclif (ca. \n1330-1384) English \nreforming theologian \nwho inspired John \nHuss, the Lollards, \nand other leaders of the \nProtestant \n\nReformation. Wyclif \nserved as rector of \nFillingham, prebend of \nAust, warden of \nCanterbury, and rector \nof Ludgershall in \nBuckinghamshire. \n\n\n\n425 \n\n\n\nIdolatry many pilgrimages to its famous Rood of Grace, an idol of Christ that \n\ncould "come alive": its eyes and lips moved. Cromwell\'s officers \n^^^^^^^^^^ m disclosed the deception in 1 536, publicly displaying the wires and rods \ninside the statue that created the "miracle." 6 \n\nSimilarly "miraculous" idols, in effect, were the many pagan tomb- \ncarvings and statues taken over by Christian churches and \nre-christened martyrs and saints. Where pagan folk were used to visiting \nshrines of heroes and demigods for petitions or healing, churches \nsimply moved into the shrine and created a new tale of martyrdom for \nan old god, using his faked "relics" for healing magic. Especially with \nmedieval monks, "the manufacture of martyrs became a thriving indus- \ntry." Even the bones of ordinary Roman citizens dug out of ancient \ntombs or catacombs became "idols" in that they were worshipped as \ndivine containers for the spirits of saints. 7 This kind of idolatry was \nnot a new Christian invention, but a copy of pagan practice. The \nwritings of Pliny show magical recipes in classical times using the \nrelics of slain gladiators, or hair, or pieces of garments, or nails from a \ncross on which a man had been executed. 8 \n\nThe Catholic church changed its collective mind several times \nabout idols before settling down to permit them. Certainly early sects, \nsuch as the Iconoclasts, adopted a typically Semitic horror of idols and \ndevoted themselves to smashing every metal or marble god or \ngoddess. At the Council of Constantinople, the bishops unanimously \ndecreed that images were inventions of the devil and must be kept \nout of Christian churches. Three decades later, the Council of Nicaea \nreversed this decision and even anathematized those who refused to \nworship images. Two more councils contradicted each other\'s decisions \non the matter, until in 843 the images were reinstated in the churches \nonce for all. 9 \n\nOne way in which the church excused its own idolatry was to \nclaim that its idols were not real idols but only "symbols." Whatever \nthis may have meant, the churchmen knew perfectly well that the \naverage worshipper made no such distinction. The images were as \nthoroughly idolized as any African fetish or Phidian Athene: \n\nThe instant we ascribe to an image . . . real power to act, we make of it an \n\ninspired being in itself, and all the sophistry in the world as to its being a \n\nmeans of faith, or a symbol, or causing a higher power to act on the \n\nsuppliant, is rubbish. The devotee believes tout bonnement that the \n\nimage works the cure, and if he did not, any other image of the Virgin or \n\nSaint would answer the same purpose. This chaff has been thrashed out \n\na thousand times. . . . And it will last, while one fetish endures, that the \n\nhierophant will call it a mere "symbol, " and the ignorant worshipper, \n\nabsolutely unable to comprehend him, will worship the symbol as the \n\nthing itself as he is really expected to do. w \n\n1.

Hyde, 61, 77. \n\n\n\nImmaculate Conception \n\nOften erroneously thought to refer to the conception of Christ, the \ndoctrine of the Immaculate Conception actually was invented to absolve \nthe virgin Mary of original sin from the moment of her own \nconception. Early fathers of the church said Mary couldn\'t be Theoto- \nkos (God-bearer) if she was human, therefore tainted with the sin of \n\n\n\n427 \n\n\n\nImmanuel \n\nInanna \n\n\n\nEve; it was heresy to worship her as divine. 1 Nevertheless, people \ninsisted on worshipping her. 2 By the 1 2th century, Mariolatry even \novershadowed the worship of God and Christ; so the doctrine of the \nImmaculate Conception was invented to make her uniquely holy. \n\nMany churchmen opposed the doctrine, which was heatedly \nargued for the next 700 years. Finally it was adopted as an article of \nfaith by Pope Pius IX in 1854. 3 Every Catholic was commanded to \nbelieve henceforth that Mary "at the first instant of her conception, \nwas preserved immaculate from all stain of original sin, by the singular \ngrace and privilege granted to her by Almighty God." 4 \n\nA certain unnamed medieval holy man had been informed by a \ndivine source that Mary\'s birthday was September 8, precisely nine \nmonths after the December festival which originally represented the \nconception of the Virgin Goddess Kore. 5 Apparently the date was \nchosen to celebrate Epiphany and the Immaculate Conception at the \nsame time. \n\nThese events being equally devoid of documentation, their inven- \ntion and promulgation sometimes aroused scorn among \nnon-Catholics. Hazlitt scoffed: "We hear of her immaculate conception \nas an afterthought, on the part of the Romanists. . . . [T]he whole \nnarrative touching her [Mary] is evidently fabulous, and . . . the immac- \nulate conception by her mother, her own purification ... are \nabsurdities." 6 \n\nHow Mary\'s conception took place was a problem that aroused \nsome ingenious theological nonsense. Mary\'s father was not God or a \nspirit but a living man, and if he had sexual intercourse with Mary\'s \nmother it would mean using the medium of transmission of original \nsin, by the church\'s own teaching. Some theologians would have it that \nhis seed was carried magically, as if he were an incubus. \n\nl.deRiencourt, 150. 2. Daly, 92. 3. Young, 203. 4. Encyc. Brit., "Mary." \n5. de Voragine, 524. 6.

Wedding hymns for the hieros gamos said, "Oh \n\n\n\n428 \n\n\n\nmy queen, queen of the universe, the queen who encompasses the Incest \nuniverse, may he [the king] enjoy long days at your holy lap." Some- \ntimes she turned her power against the king\'s enemies: "My queen, _^_^__^_^__ \nthe foreign lands cower at your cry My queen, you are all-devour- \ning in your power My queen, the great gods fled before you like \n\nfluttering bats." Tradition said the city of Agade was completely \ndestroyed because Inanna abandoned its temple: "Holy Inanna \nforsook the shrine Agade . . . ; she went forth against the city in battle." \' \n\nInanna was the source of the earth\'s life blood. She filled the wells, \nrivers, and springs with her "blood." As a fertility deity, like her \nBabylonian counterpart Ishtar, she annually descended into the under- \nworld to rescue her consort Dumuzi [Tammuz]. As Nanna, Nana, or \nAnna she became the holy virgin mother of Attis, the bride of Balder, \nand the elder Virgin Mother whom Christians called "God\'s \nGrandmother." 2 \n\nHittites called her Inaras. In the land of Hatti she renewed her \nvirginity each year to become the bride of the sacred king at the Purulli \nfestival, which later passed into the Jewish Purim. The chosen man was \nisolated in a royal castle or tower, and slain at the appointed time so his \nblood would help the Goddess fertilize the land. Certain writings of \nlamentation suggest that the king-martyr regretted his brief glory. 3 \n\n1. Pritchard, A.N.E., 127, 202, 207. 2. Graves, W.G., 411. 3.

His mother-marrying, father-killing legend arose \nnot from a wish-fulfillment fantasy but from the ancient system of \nsuccession of sacred kings, whereby every previous king was slain by his \nsuccessor, chosen to be the queen\'s new bridegroom. The killer was \nalways described as a "son" of the deceased because he was the same \ngod reincarnated in another consort of the same mother-bride. Such \nsacred incest can still be traced even in the Christian image of the divine \nSon who is indistinguishable from his Father, who impregnated his \nown Mother (i.e., Mother of God) to beget himself. \n\nWhen patriarchal invaders overthrew the Theban matriarchate, \nthey purposely misinterpreted the sacred icons that told the story of \nits royal succession. The name of the deceased "father," Laius, simply \nmeant "King," and that of the widowed "mother" was the same as \nthe title of the Moon Goddess. The replacement, Oedipus, was depict- \ned as a stranger from a distant land. To make him the king\'s true son, \nimprobable details were added to show he was sent away in infancy and \nbrought up among foreigners. Freud\'s rather subjective notion that \nall men secretly want to kill their fathers the so-called Oedipus \ncomplex may have had more to do with Freud\'s own experience of \na repressive father than with any mythic archetype. 1 \n\n\n\n429 \n\n\n\nIncest Sacred incest between father-son and mother-bride was usual \n\namong ancient god-kings. It was considered necessary for the god- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ dess-queen to be periodically supplied with a young, virile consort who \nembodied the same god again as the older consort. Thus Egyptian \ngods like Amon and Osiris were respectfully entitled, "Husband of thy \nmother." 2 The reborn Savior appeared as Min, or Menu, the Moon- \nbull who mated with his sacred Cow-mother. In human form, he was \nshown with an abnormally long erect phallus, as an ithyphallic sex \ngod like Eros or Kama, the Bull "from whom spring the delights of \nlove." 3 \n\nThroughout Egypt generally the company of gods of a town or city were \nthree in number . . . ; two members of such a triad were gods, one old \nand one young, and the third was a goddess, who was, naturally, the wife, \nor female counterpart, of the older god. The younger god was the son \nof the older god and goddess, and he was supposed to possess all the \nattributes and powers which belonged to his father. . . . [I]t was as- \nsumed that he would succeed to his rank and throne when the older god \nhad passed away. * \n\nHere was the basis of trinities consisting of Father, Son, and \nHoly Spirit (or, Goddess: the third member of the trinity was female, as \nshe was even in Gnostic Christianity under the name of Sophia). The \nsame trinity occurs in almost all mythologies, without ever developing \ninto a complete family: there is no daughter, only a son. That is, man- \nas-youth and man-as-man have their separate projections into divinity; \nbut woman is always the same. \n\nUnlike Freud, Jung said the meaning of the mother-son incest in \nreligions was not based on simple eroticism but on the idea of rebirth. \n"To get back to the mother again in order to be born again by the \nmother. . . . One of the simplest ways was to fructify the mother and \nprocreate oneself again. ... It is not incestuous cohabitation that is \nsought, but rebirth. . . . The neurotic who cannot leave his mother \nhas good reason; fear of death holds him there. It appears that there is \nno concept and no word strong enough to express the meaning of \nthis conflict. Whole religions are built to give value to the magnitude of \nthis conflict." 5 \n\nThough the myth of Oedipus was not about true "Oedipal" \nfather-son rivalry but rather about sacred kingship, the theme of male \njealousy was amply demonstrated elsewhere in myths. Rank says, "It is \nnot necessary to explore the heavens for some process into which this \ntrait might be laboriously fitted . . . ; in reality, a certain tension is \nfrequently, if not regularly, revealed between father and son . . . \nrelated to the competition for the tender devotion and love of the \nmother." 6 It might be a fruitful avenue for psychological investiga- \ntion to determine why mother-son love in mythology was nearly always \ntransmuted into the realm of the erotic. \n\n1.

Greeks \npracticed incubation especially in the healing temples of Asclepius and \nHygeia. Egyptians\' favorite incubus appeared in temples of Imhotep. 1 \nUndoubtedly, the appearance of the incubus was often carefully staged, \nwhen the sleeper was a figure of political importance, to issue the \n"right" prophecies and advice that would benefit the temple. \n\nChristians copied the custom of incubation, which became \n"watching" or "keeping vigil." It was recommended in a time of \ntroublesome decision to "watch and pray" overnight in a church, to \ncourt a vision of guidance. The incubus, however, was diabolized. He \nwas no longer the same as a guiding angel. The reason for his fall from \ngrace was the ancient tradition of midnight sexual relationships between \nincubating women and priests, or incubating men and priestesses. \nIncubi thus became spirits of lust. \n\nCertain churchmen said incubi were demon lovers of women, able \nto beget children in a demonic version of the Virgin Birth. Father \nLudovico Sinistrari said hedging his bets like every well-trained cler- \nic "Subject to correction by our Holy Mother Church, and as a mere \nexpression of private opinion, I say that the Incubus, when having \nintercourse with a woman, begets the human fetus from his own seed." \nAs a "well-known" example of a demon-begotten man, Sinistrari cited \n"that damnable heresiarch Martin Luther." 2 As for the opinion of the \ndamnable heresiarch himself, Luther said all odd-looking children \nshould be destroyed at birth, for they were clearly the offspring of \ndemons. 3 \n\nOther authorities, like St. Thomas Aquinas, insisted that demons \nmust be sterile. Therefore an incubus could impregnate a woman only \nby carrying semen from a man with whom the demon previously \ncopulated in the form of a succubus or she-demon for demons were \nthought to change their sex at will. 4 Aquinas also asserted that a demon \ncould use semen lost in a wet dream so a man could be "at one and the \nsame time both a virgin and a father." 5 \n\nHere Aquinas contradicted both the biblical tradition and \nSt. Augustine, who cited Genesis 6:4 to prove that fallen angels begot \nchildren on mortal women: "The sons of God came in unto the \ndaughters of men, and they bare children to them." Pope Benedict XIV \nannounced, "This passage has reference to devils known as incubi and \nsuccubi." The pope declined to decide the question of demonic \nconception, however; he simply mentioned both schools of thought: \n"Some writers deny that there can be offspring. . . . Others, however, \nasserting that coitus is possible, maintain that children may result." On \nthis theory, a woman was burned at Carcassonne in 1275 for bearing a \nchild to the devil. 6 \n\nChurchmen with some classical education pointed out that the \n\n\n\nIncubus \n\n\n\nLudovico Maria \nSinistrari 18th- \ncentury Franciscan \ntheologian, author of \nDemonality. \n\n\n\n431 \n\n\n\nIncubus \n\n\n\nPierre de Lancre \n\n(1553-1601) Trial judge \nfor the Inquisition, \nwho boasted of burning \nhundreds of witches \nand charged the entire \npopulation of Pays \nde Labourd some \n30,000 persons \nwith witchcraft. He \nwrote several books \non witchcraft, which \nwere accepted as \nauthoritative. \n\n\n\ngods of the heathen devils, by the church\'s definition were fa- \nthers. 7 Many legends accepted by the church attributed demonic \nparentage to such historical figures as Robert of Normandy, Alexan- \nder the Great, Plato, Scipio Africanus, all the Huns, and all the \nCypriots. 8 A 6th-century History of the Goths declared that the Huns \nwere descended from the offspring of women and incubi. 9 Neverthe- \nless, the opinion of Aquinas generally overruled both classical and \nbiblical precedent. \n\nWhatever the incubus\'s reproductive potential, his sexual capacity \ninspired ill-concealed male envy in an age when nearly all men were \nso sexually naive as to confuse penis size with lovemaking skills. Father \nSinistrari said women who lay with incubi found afterward that the \nlovemaking of mere men was "paltry and unable to arouse them to any \ndegree." 10 Pico della Mirandola explained why: incubi were hand- \nsome and notable for "the extraordinary largeness of their members. . . . \nThe devils can even agitate the thing when it is inside, wherefore the \nwomen derive more pleasure than they do with men." De Lancre \nquoted the testimony of an accused witch, who said her devil "had a \nmember like a mule\'s ... as long and as thick as an arm. ... He always \nexposed his instrument, of such beautiful shape and measurements." \nDespite these unwieldy proportions, incubi were said to seduce very \nyoung children. The Chancellor of Wiirzburg declared in August, \n1629, that "There are some 300 children of three or four years who \nhave had intercourse with devils." \' \' \n\nSatyrs, fauns, and the Gaulish dusii (from deus, "god") were cited \nin an official Inquisition handbook as incubi who had intercourse with \nwitches in front of witnesses. St. Augustine called the Gaulish Dusius \nan incubus who lay with mortal women; and later churchmen \nearnestly supported Augustine with what they conceived to be proof. 12 \nWomen seemed unaccountably willing to copulate with their de- \nmons under the eyes of "bystanders"; the latter reported that, while the \ndemon remained invisible, "it has been apparent from the disposition \nof those limbs and members which pertain to the venereal act and \norgasm, [that] . . . they have been copulating with Incubus devils." B \n\nNuns appeared especially vulnerable to the attentions of incubi. 14 \nAuthorities said nuns often awoke in the morning "to find themselves \npolluted as if they had slept with men." 15 Some nuns claimed they slept \nwith Christ, but this was condemned as blasphemy resulting from \ndemonic possession, even though the church taught them to think of \nthemselves as Christ\'s wives. \n\nThere were some Christian saints who functioned as incubi \nthemselves. At shrines of St. Giles in Normandy and St. Rene in \nAnjou, women would lie all night with the saints\' ithyphallic images \nhoping to conceive children. 16 Christians used to incubate in the \ntemple of Isis at Canopis, following local custom; so the bishops moved \nsome bones into the temple and called them relics of two martyrs, \nCyrus of Alexandria and John of Edessa. Incubations continued as \n\n\n\n432 \n\n\n\nbefore, and any subsequent miracles were credited to the martyrs Indulgence \n\ninstead of to Isis. 17 \n\nOn occasion, women who consorted with incubi seemed to inspire ^^^^^^^^^^ \nmore fear than the demons themselves. An Anglo-Saxon Leechbook \nprescribed magic salves for protection, not against incubi but against \n"women with whom the Devil had sexual intercourse." At Toulouse \nin 1275, a 56-year-old woman of means was robbed of her worldly \ngoods by ecclesiastical confiscation, and tortured until she confessed \nthat she had intercourse with an incubus every night for years and gave \nbirth to the demon\'s child, which was half wolf and half snake. 18 \n\nPerhaps the ultimate irony was the church\'s official opinion that all \n\nthe activities of incubi were performed "with the permission of \n\nGod." 19 But what God allowed, men punished. \n\n1.

By \nselling indulgence, the church reaped enormous profit with no material \ninvestment only a promise that the purchaser would be absolved of \nhis sins and admitted to heaven after death. No customer ever returned \nto complain of being cheated. \n\nIt became the rule for popes to promise plenary indulgence \n(absolute remission of all sins) to military leaders who fought the \nchurch\'s crusades. Bills of indulgence became the spiritual carrot \ncorresponding to the stick of excommunication, which was thought \nto sentence the sinner irrevocably to hellfire. \n\nBills of indulgence were peddled by Renaissance popes to earn \nmoney for their expensive lifestyle. Pope Alexander VI made a \ncommercial empire out of selling pardons. Pope Leo X sent a Domini- \ncan, Johann Tetzel, into Germany to sell indulgences for varying \nnumbers of days\' worth of release from purgatory, depending on price. \nTetzel\'s announcements read: \n\n/ have here the passports . . . to lead the human sou] into Paradise. \nInasmuch as for a single one of the mortal sins, several of which are \ncommitted every day after confession, seven years of expiation either on \nearth or in Purgatory are imposed who, for the sake of a quarter of a \nflorin, would hesitate to secure one of these letters which will admit your \ndivine, immortal soul to the celestial joys of Paradise? \' \n\nOne observer wrote in the 1 5th century: "Sinners say nowa- \nlays, I care not what or how many evils I do before God, for I can get at \nMice, without the least difficulty, plenary remission of any guilt or sin \n\n\n\n433 \n\n\n\nInfallibility whatever through an indulgence granted me by the Pope, whose \n\nwritten grant I have bought for fourpence . . . , for these grantors of \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Indulgence run about from place to place and sometimes give a letter \nfor twopence, sometimes for a good drink of wine and beer, some- \ntimes to pay their losses at a game of ball, sometimes for the hire of a \nprostitute, sometimes for fleshly love." 2 \n\nReginald Scot thought the peddling of indulgences showed the \ntrivial nature of Catholic doctrine, especially when coupled with the \nchurch\'s idolatry. He wrote of "the folly of some papists, who seeing \nand confessing the pope\'s absurd religion, in the erection and \nmaintenance of idolatry and superstition, specially in images, pardons, \nand relics of saints, will persevere to think, that the rest of his doctrine \nand trumpery is holy and good." 3 \n\nBut not all Catholics approved of the sale of indulgence. In \nPrague, papal bulls of indulgence were publicly burned at the pillory, \nhaving been carried there strung around the neck of a whore, who \nenlivened the proceedings with lascivious capering. 4 Minstrels and \nother popular entertainers throughout Europe made fun of the doctrine \nof indulgence with a satiric couplet: \n\nAs soon as the coin in the coffer rings, \nThe soul from out of the fire springs. 5 \n\nl.Chamberlin,B.P.,241. 2.

Lea unabridged, 489. \n5.Chamberlin,B.P,241. \n\n\n\nInfallibility \n\nThe doctrine of papal infallibility stated that anything the pope said \nwas invariably true, and anything he did was invariably right, because \nGod could not permit his pope to speak or act erroneously. The \ndoctrine first took shape in the 1 5 th century. It was set forth by \nimplication in the writings of Torquemada. Cardinal Cajetano openly \nproclaimed it, inspiring the pope to issue the bull Pastor eternus, which \nmade the doctrine of infallibility part of canon law. 1 \n\nIn the 19th-century Age of Enlightenment, one scientific discov- \nery after another demonstrated that the statements of popes on \nmatters like the solar system, biology, botany, geology, and other earth \nsciences to say nothing of witchcraft, diabolism, and the Bible had \nbeen patently fallible. In fact, wrong. So the church decided that the \npope was still certainly infallible but only when he spoke officially, ex \ncathedra, for then God protected his words from error if not at other \ntimes. Unfortunately this served for only a short time. It was soon \nfound that popes were wrong in numerous statements officially en- \nshrined in bulls and encyclicals. \n\nThe doctrine of infallibility had to be revised again, this time to \nstate that the pope is infallible only when speaking "on matters of \n\n\n\n434 \n\n\n\njiith and morals." Still another revision of the doctrine may be due in Infernus \n\nhe near future. Innocents \n\n1. Guignebert, 357. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n\n\nkfernus \n\nlatin word for the underworld, source of our "Inferno" which \nnplies a place of hellish fire and heat; but the Infernus was not \necessarily hot at all. The name simply meant "the place within." It \nas usually pictured as dark, not fiery. There were several entrances, \nake Avernus was one; another was the sacred cave of the Cumaean \ntfafl. \n\n\n\niheritance \n\nee Matrilineal Inheritance. \n\n\n\ninocents, Slaughter of \n\nart of the traditional myth of sacred kingship: the incumbent king is \narned by a prophecy of the birth of his future supplanter and tries to \n;cape his fate by killing numbers of recently born infants. Innocents \nere slaughtered in the myths of Sargon, Nimrod, Moses, Jason, \n(rishna, and Mordred as well as in that of Jesus. \n\nProbably the original killer of innocents was Kamsa, king of the \nhojas, who tried to kill Krishna along with a batch of other children, \nhe slaughter is depicted in the cave-temple at Elephanta, where the \nloss is the symbol of the king. 1 In this case Krishna escaped because \np was secretly exchanged with an infant girl, who was killed in his \n|ace. She grew up in heaven, and became a Goddess. She prophe- \npd that she would smash Kamsa and drink his blood; and Kamsa \n[ealized that she was his own death." 2 \n\nThe Arthurian version of the Slaughter of the Innocents followed \ne typical pagan model. Merlin predicted that Arthur would be \npthrown by a prince born on May Day, the old Celtic New Year as it \nps reckoned when kings were usually replaced by their tanists or \njons." Mordred was Arthur\'s son by his sister Margawse, therefore \npth a son and a uterine nephew, able to claim the throne by both fa- \ner-right and mother-right. Arthur seemed not to realize the obvious \nkalifications of Mordred when he ordered the slaughter of May Day \nlildren, according to Malory\'s account; and the story was further \naddled by giving the children various ages, though they were all \nbm on the same day ("some four weeks old, and some less"). 3 \n\n\n\n435 \n\n\n\nInquisition Then King Arthur let send for all the children born on May Day, \n\nbegotten of lords and born of ladies; for Merlin told King Arthur that \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ he that should destroy him should be born on May Day, where for he se, \n\nfor them all, upon pain of death; and so there were found many lords\' \nsons, and all were put in a ship to the sea, and some were four weeks oh \nand some less. And so by fortune the ship drave unto a castle, and was \nall to-riven, and destroyed the most part, save that Mordred was cast up, \nand a good man found him, and nourished him till he was fourteen \nyear old, and then he brought him to court, as it rehearseth afterward, \ntoward the end of the Death of Arthur. * \n\nThe Christian version of the slaughter of the innocents occurs \nonly in the Gospel of Matthew. Other Gospels say nothing of it. Marl \nand John make no mention of Jesus\'s early years. As far as Luke is \nconcerned, Jesus grew up quietly in Galilee after presentation in the \ntemple of Jerusalem after his birth; there was no king threatening his \nlife. Matthew\'s "slaughter" seems to have been included only to provi \nan excuse to locate the holy child in Egypt, to create fulfillment of a \nprophecy, "Out of Egypt have I called my son" (Matthew 2:1 5). \nTherefore Herod\'s attack on the children probably was invented to \nprovide a link between Jesus and his Egyptian counterpart Osiris. \n\nThe infants supposedly slain by King Herod were canonized en \nmasse, though there are no scriptural records of any of their names, \nnor even of their number. A modern Catholic scholar notes that \nenormous numbers have been postulated in the past, but "it is \nunlikely that there were more than about twenty of them at the most.\' \nYet this statement has no more foundation than a statement that \nthere were two hundred, or two thousand, or none at all perhaps tht \nmost likely possibility, since this was a universal, not a specific, myth. \n\nThe entire unknown, unnamed group became patrons of childre \nand on their feast day, December 28, it was customary in England for \nchildren to dress up and go from house to house begging gifts. \nHowever, in 1 540 an ecclesiastical proclamation ordered that this \ncustom must cease. 6 It has not been observed since. \n\n1.

Historian Henry Charles Lea, recognized as the leading expert \non the medieval period, called the Inquisition "a standing mockery of \njustice perhaps the most iniquitous that the arbitrary cruelty of man \nhas ever devised. . . . Fanatic zeal, arbitrary cruelty, and insatiable cupj \nity rivalled each other in building up a system unspeakably \natrocious. It was a system which might well seem the invention of \ndemons." (See Torture.) \n\n\n\n436 \n\n\n\nIt was invented primarily to force public acceptance of a church \n[he public didn\'t want. According to a contemporary aphorism, the \nbhurch had not ten commandments but only one: "Bring hither the \nmoney." 2 St. Bernard deplored the church\'s greed: "Whom can you \nknow me among the prelates who does not seek rather to empty the \npockets of his flock than to subdue their vices?" 3 \n\nBulgarian writers said the priests of Rome were given to drunken- \nness and robbery, and "there is none to forbid them." The local \npresbyter Cosmas didn\'t deny it but only insisted that Christians must \nhonor even wicked priests. 4 This was an accepted doctrine. Pilichdorf \nbid, "The worst man, if he be a priest, is more worthy than the holiest \npf layman." 5 \n\nPriests were a privileged class, but their privileges were more and \nbore resented. In the 12th century, monasteries made themselves \nInto wineshops and gambling houses; nunneries became private whore- \nnouses for the clergy; priests used a confessional to seduce female \nparishioners. Episcopal collectors were depicted in popular stories as the \nworst of all sinners. 6 "The sale of Church offices was constant and \nunblushing." 7 Even the pope observed that "those charged with divine \nrace . . . participate in rapine and despoliation, even in the shedding \n)f blood." 8 \n\nPierre de Bruys was burned in 1126 for declaring openly that \n\'God is no more in the church than in the market-place; the forms \n|nd ceremonies which to so many folk replace true religion are utterly \niseless; the Cross should not be prayed to. . . . The priests lie in \njretending that they made Christ\'s body and give it to the people for \nheir salvation." 9 According to Tyndale, common folk said of any- \nhing that went wrong, "the bishop has blessed it." If the dinner burned, \nhey said the bishop has put his foot in it, "because the bishops burn \nyho they list and whosoever displeaseth them." 10 \n\nWould-be reformers within the church were usually silenced, \nfrere Raymond Jean was executed for preaching against the church\'s \nIbuses. He said bitterly, "The enemies of the faith are among ourselves, \nfhe Church which governs us is symbolled by the Great Whore of \nhe Apocalypse, who persecutes the poor and the ministers of Christ." n \n\nNicholas de Clamanges, rector of the University of Paris, declared \nh an open letter that the popes were ravishers, not pastors, of their \nlocks: "The priesthood has become a misery reduced to profaning its \nailing. . . . Who do you think can endure, among so many other \npuses, your mercenary appointments, your multiple sale of benefices, \nbur elevation of men without honesty or virtue to the most eminent \nfositions?" n Pope Alexander VI, one of the men so described, was \npedited with the cynical remark, "It is not God\'s wish that a sinner \nhould die, but that he should live and pay." n \n\nA Franciscan splinter group, the Fraticelli, withdrew from their \nrder, claiming the pope and all his successors were tainted with the \nIn of simony. Therefore the church had been excommunicated by \n\n\n\nInquisition \n\n\n\nPeter von Pilichdorf \n\nAnti-heretical \nmissionary writer of \nthe early 14th century. \n\n\n\nPierre de Bruys \n\nReforming theologian \nof the 12th century, \nfounder of the heretical \nPetrobrusian sect. \n\n\n\nWilliam Tyndale \n\n(ca. 1494-1536) English \necclesiastical \nreformer, influenced by \nWyclif; translator of - \nthe first English- \nlanguage Bibles, \nmany of which were \nseized and burned by \nCatholic authorities. \nAfter a life of \npreaching and literary \nactivity which helped \nestablish the \nReformation, \nTyndale was arrested \nand executed in \nBrussels. \n\n\n\n437 \n\n\n\ninquisition \n\n\n\nWaldenses Also \ncalled Valdenses or \nVaudois, this heretic \nsect was founded in \nsouthern France \nduring the 1 2th century \nby Peter Waldo, or \nValdes, who preached a \nlife of simplicity and \npoverty in imitation of \nChrist. \n\n\n\nGod, for ignoring Christ\'s vow of poverty. They called the pope an \nAntichrist. 14 These heretics were soon exterminated. One of their \ncenters, the village of Magnalata, was leveled by order of Pope \nMartin V and every resident slain. 15 \n\nIn 1325 Pope John issued the bull Cum inter nonnullos, which \n"infallibly" declared it was heresy to say Jesus and his apostles owned \nno property. Inquisitors were ordered to prosecute those who believed \nJesus was a poor man. The group called Spiritual Franciscans, who \ndid so believe, were taught an immediate lesson when the pope had 1 14 \nof their number burned alive. 16 \n\nThe offenses of the Waldenses included many "wrong" opinions. \nThey said laymen and women had the right to preach; masses, votive \nofferings, and prayers for the dead were useless; purgatory did not exist; \none could pray to God without setting foot in a church; and a bad \npriest should be forbidden to administer sacraments "a proposition \nwhich does no less than deny lasting grace to the sacrament of \nOrders, and thus destroys the fundamental privilege of the Church." \nThe Waldenses said priests who demand money for administering \ncommunion are lower than Judas, "for they sell for one denarius that \nbody for which he demanded thirty." 17 \n\nAlong with public disgust at the church\'s avarice, there was a \ngrowing suspicion sparked by Gnostic philosophies from the east \nthat the church\'s myths of the garden of Eden, the fall, original sin, \nheaven and hell, the virgin birth, the meaning of salvation, and so on, \nwere literally untrue. Because people refused to believe the eucharistic \nbread and wine were literally flesh and blood, the papacy lost all of \nBohemia, which after many wars and crusades founded its separate \nMoravian church. Tenets of the Roman church were widely ques- \ntioned. Priests were forbidden to "dispute concerning the faith against \nsuch astute heretics" in public, lest they expose themselves to \nridicule. 18 As Becker said, "This is neurosis in a nutshell: the miscarriag< \nof clumsy lies about reality." 19 \n\nDespite the church\'s efforts to keep the populace in ignorance, \neven among the peasantry there were individuals astute enough to \nrecognize theology\'s clumsy lies. Even the 12th-century passion for \nbuilding cathedrals seems to have represented a last-ditch effort to \nhold the wandering attention of the people by giving them splendid \ntemples of the "Lady," to replace the Mother-shrines previously \ndestroyed. At length not even the Notre Dames sufficed. The Church \nhad to fall back on its traditional propensity to maintain a reign of \nterror. 20 \n\nGuignebert says Christianity was "given to warfare; exclusive, \nviolently intolerant, to the Jews especially menacing; bristling with \nperemptory dogmas which set reason at defiance; marked by complex \nelaborate rites . . . kept up to the mark by a formidable army of monks \nand kept in check by a quibbling troop of acute theologians." 21 The \nviolence of the Inquisition was its ultimate weapon. \n\n\n\n438 \n\n\n\nViolence could be invoked under this system by nothing more Inquisition \n\nhan ordinary living, just as the doctrine of original sin was invoked by \n\nlothing more than being born. Not only sexual impulses, which were ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nalways labeled corrupt, but almost every other natural impulse was \n/iewed as evidence of anti-Christian perversity. 22 \n\nModern apologists say the Inquisition served some good purposes, \nike helping secular courts bring criminals to justice. 23 Only a few \nlecades ago, even Catholic manuals mendaciously claimed the Inquisi- \nion was a purely civil tribunal. 24 Actually, the Inquisition was \nininterested in secular crimes, except insofar as they could provide a \n>asis for a charge of heresy or witchcraft. The Inquisition was created \no win the war between the church and a disillusioned public. Coulton \nays, "The so-called Ages of Faith were only Ages of Acquiescence"; \nput even the acquiescence was wearing thin. 25 \n\nThe power of the Inquisition was established and enlarged by a \nieries of papal bulls. Ad extirpanda of Pope Innocent IV, issued May \n[5, 1252, was "a terrible measure against heretics in Italy, authorizing \neizure of their goods, imprisonment, torture, and, on conviction, \nleath, all on minimal evidence." 26 \n\nThe Inquisition was the most elaborate extortion racket ever \nievised, primarily developed for profit. 27 After the arrest, the property \nif the accused was instantly confiscated. Nothing seems to have been \n^turned. The popes publicly praised the rule of confiscation as a \nbrime weapon against heresy. 28 Confiscation was the organization\'s \nhison d\'etre; when the rule of confiscation was not applied, "the \nlusiness of defending the faith languished lamentably." Affluent Italy \npade its inquisitors incredibly rich in the 14th century. Within two \nrears, the inquisitor of Florence amassed "more than seven thousand \nlorins, an enormous sum." 29 As the inquisitor Heinrich von Schulth- \njis complacently wrote, "When I have you tortured, and by the severe \nneans afforded by the law I bring you to confession, then I perform a \nLork pleasing in God\'s sight; and it profiteth me." 30 \n\nConfiscation took place before conviction, because it was taken for \nranted that no one escaped. "Officials considered themselves safe in \njcting upon the presumption" of guilt. Sometimes confiscation took \n[lace even before confession. In 1 300 a nobleman named Jean \nlaudier was arrested and first examined on January 20. He refused to \npnfess for a long time but finally was broken down by torture and \njonfessed on February 5. He was condemned on March 7. However, \nis impounded property had been sold on January 29, before the \njonfession. Similarly, Guillem Garric was arrested at Carcassonne in \n284 but not sentenced until 1319. Nevertheless, officials were \nbarreling over his castle in 1301. 31 \n\nAccused persons were expected to pay the expenses of their own \nImprisonment, even of their own torture. This continental custom \n[as followed in Scotland where, for example, torturers charged their \nictims 6 shillings and 8 pence for branding on the cheek. In \n\n\n\n439 \n\n\n\nInquisition England, accused witches were sometimes acquitted; yet they were kept \n\nin prison until they paid the expenses of their unlawful \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ imprisonment. 32 \n\nThe Inquisition\'s prisoners had to pay for their own food in prison. \nWithout money they starved. Pope Gregory XI noted that too many \nwere starving to death before they could be brought to the stake, but it \nseems not to have occurred to him to feed them on church funds. \nInstead, he offered indulgences to all who would donate food to the \n"many heretics and those defamed for heresy, who in consequence of \ntheir poverty cannot be sustained in prison unless the pious liberality of \nthe faithful shall assist them as a work of charity." Thus the church \nbent its own rules, which said anyone who helped a heretic was to be \nsuspected of heresy also. Lea commented: \n\nThere is something so appallingly grotesque in tearing honest, industrious \nfolk from their homes by the thousand, in thrusting them into dun- \ngeons to rot and starve, and then evading the cost of feeding them by \npresenting them to the faithful as objects of charity, that the proclama- \ntion which Gregory issued August 15th, 1376, is perhaps the most \nshameless monument of a shameless age. n \n\nWhen an arrested heretic had unpaid debts, the judges simply \ncanceled the debts on the ground that no heretic could engage in legal \ntransactions. Thus, "creditors were shamelessly cheated." The entire \nfinancial network of European society was strained by its religious \nmasters. "In addition to the misery inflicted by these wholesale \nconfiscations on the thousands of innocent and helpless women and \nchildren thus stripped of everything. ... All safeguards were with- \ndrawn from every transaction. No creditor or purchaser could be sure of \nthe orthodoxy of him with whom he was dealing. . . . The practice of \nproceeding against the memory of the dead after an interval virtually \nunlimited, rendered it impossible for any man to feel secure in the \npossession of property, whether it had descended in his family for \ngenerations, or had been acquired within an ordinary lifetime." 34 \n\nProperty could be seized from the dead, whose bones might be \ndug up from their graves and burned as post-mortem heretics; then \nthe property was taken away from legal heirs. 35 If a person knowing he \nwas about to be arrested tried to sell or give away his property, or to \ncommit suicide before the torturers got to him, his property was seized, \nbecause a heretic was forbidden to make any legal transaction, and a \nsuicide could bequeathe property to no one; it was taken by the church. \nIf the accused fled the country, he was tried and convicted in \nabsentia. Families of the accused were left destitute, and no one dared \nhelp them for fear of falling under suspicion. The Inquisition estab- \nlished the law of property seizure for suicides, which remained the rule \nin most European countries and the British Isles until 1870. 36 \n\nInquisitors could also impose heavy fines. Sometimes it was argued \nthat fines were useless, since all the property of the accused heretic \ndisappeared in confiscation anyway; but the inquisitors invented a class \n\n440 \n\n\n\nf unwitting miscreants called "defenders," whose heresy might Inquisition \n\n:onsist only of a single thoughtless word overheard or spoken. These \n\nould be fined for their oversight. 37 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe system of fines often developed into a protection racket, \nnquisitors could "exchange the punishment of the body with the \n>unishment of the purse," as Scot put it, and there were many who \niaid annual fees to escape persecution. 38 \n\nA person who opposed or impeded the inquisitors in any way \niecame at once excommunicate, and after a year in this condition \nt -as "handed over without further ceremony to the secular arm for \n>urning, without trial and without forgiveness." No one was acquir- \ned. If a confession could not be obtained which was extremely rare, \nbanks to the use of torture the sentence was "not proven." Even \nben, the prisoner could be kept indefinitely in prison in case new \nvidence should arise, or fresh tortures prove effective. 39 Should a \nictim resist all tortures and survive, which was virtually unheard of, he \ntill was not released. He could be sentenced to life imprisonment for \nobduracy." \n\nThe witch\'s or heretic\'s trial was a mockery. The accused had no \niwyer; Pope Boniface directed that trials must be conducted "simply, \nwithout the noise and form of lawyers." 40 Evidence was accepted from \n\'itnesses who could not legally testify in any other kind of trial, such \ns condemned criminals, other heretics, and children, even as young as \nle age of two. The inquisitor Bodin "valued child witnesses because \n[ their tender age they could easily be persuaded or forced to in- \n>rm." 41 A witness who withdrew adverse testimony was punished \n>r perjury, but his testimony remained on the record. 42 Inquisitorial \nJes for a trial were as follows: \n\n1 . The procedure was kept secret. \n\n2. "Common report" and hearsay were accepted as proof of guilt. \n\n3. Accused was not told of the nature of the charges nor allowed \nlegal counsel. \n\n4. Witnesses were kept concealed. \n\n5. Perjurers, excommunicates, or children could give evidence \nagainst witches. \n\n6. No favorable evidence or character witnesses were permitted. \nIn any case, one who spoke for an accused heretic would be \narrested as an accomplice. \n\n7. Torture was used always, without limit of duration or severity. \nEven if the accused confessed before torture, the torture was \napplied anyway, to "validate" the confession. If the accused \ndied under torture, the record stated that the devil broke his \nneck in prison. \n\n8. Accused was forced to confirm under torture the names of \n"accomplices" suggested to him by the judges. \n\n9. No accused person was found innocent. 43 \n\nOfficially, the rule was that torture could be applied only once. \n\n441 \n\n\n\nInquisition But, by a semantic quibble, it could be "continued" any number of \n\ntimes, even over a period of years, each pause being considered a \n^^^im "suspension," not an end. There are records of some victims tortured \nover fifty times. 44 The Inquisition\'s handbook, Malleus Maleficarum, \nsaid the accused witch must be "often and frequently exposed to \ntorture. If after being fittingly tortured she refuses to confess the \ntruth, he [the inquisitor] should have other engines of torture brought \nbefore her, and tell her that she will have to endure these if she does \nnot confess. If then she is not induced by terror to confess, the torture \nmust be continued." If she remained obdurate, "she is not to be \naltogether released, but must be sent to the squalor of prison for a year, \nand be tortured, and be examined very often, especially on the more \nHoly Days." 45 \n\nAnother official rule was that the church did not shed blood. \nTherefore, victims were handed over to the secular arm (civil courts) \nfor execution. This was called relaxing or abandoning them. It was \naccompanied by a token plea for mercy: "We cast you forth from this \nour ecclesiastical Court, and leave you to be delivered to the secular \narm. But we earnestly pray that the said secular court may temper its \njustice with mercy, that there be no bloodshed or danger of death." 46 \n\nThis plea was the emptiest of formalities, designed only to absolve \nthe church of responsibility for bloodshed. In fact, "to be delivered to \nthe secular arm" was an irrevocable death sentence, which the secular \ncourt was compelled to carry out. To temper justice with "mercy" \nmeant permission to strangle the victim before she was burned, but this \nwas not often done. 47 \n\nHistory was written to order by church historians who claimed the \nchurch "took no part in the corporal punishment of heretics." \nEcclesiastical euphemism forced on civil authorities a guilt that be- \nlonged at the church\'s door. Magistrates were commanded to carry \nout the death penalty by the dire threat of excommunication and \nconsequent arrest. "The remorseless logic of St. Thomas Aquinas \nrendered it self-evident that the secular power could not escape the duty \nof putting the heretic to death. . . . [T]he only punishment recog- \nnized by the Church as sufficient for heresy was burning alive. Even if \nthe ruler was excommunicated and incapable of legally performing \nany other function, he was not relieved from the obligation of this \nsupreme duty, with which nothing was allowed to interfere. . . . The \nfact is, the Church not only defined the guilt and forced its punishment, \nbut created the crime itself." 48 \n\nThe fiction of the church\'s innocence was exposed by a bull of \nPope Leo X in 1 521. The Senate of Venice had refused to sanction \nthe numerous executions ordered by the Inquisition. The Pope wrote to \nhis legate, "We declare and order you to exhort and command the \naforesaid Senate of Venice, their Doge and his officials, to intervene no \nmore in this kind of trial, but promptly, without changing or inspect- \ning the sentences made by the ecclesiastical judges, to execute the \n\n\n\n442 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsentences which they are enjoined to carry out. And if they neglect or Inquisition \n\nrefuse, you are to compel them with the Church\'s censure and other \n\nappropriate legal measures. From this order there is no appeal." 49 A ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ndirective published in 1 599 said judges were bound under pain of \n\nmortal sin to execute witches; anyone who objected to the death \n\nsentence was suspected of complicity. 50 \n\nInquisitors "jealously guarded their records from all outsiders." 51 \nOn one occasion, magistrates of Brescia objected to burning a \nnumber of condemned witches without having examined records of \ntheir trials. But the inquisitors kept their records sequestered, and the \npope declared the magistrates\' reluctance a scandal to the faith. "He \nordered the excommunication of the magistrates if within six days \nthey did not execute the convicts ... a decision which was held to give \nthe secular courts six days in which to carry out the sentence of \ncondemnation." 52 \n\nEven when kept hidden, records were often falsified. Inquisitors \nhad special terms for everything they did. For example, torturers said \ntheir victims were "laughing" when they contorted their faces with pain; \nor "sleeping" when they fainted. Those who died under torture \neither "committed suicide" or were slain by the devil. Having confessed \nunder torture, the accused was compelled to repeat the confession \noutside the torture chamber, knowing he would be returned thereto if \nhe didn\'t obey; nevertheless, this was recorded as a confession given \n"freely and spontaneously, without the pressure of force or fear," and \ncourt documents often claimed the accused had confessed without \n[torture. Sometimes confessions were described as "voluntary" if they \njwere obtained after the first degree of torture binding and racking. 53 \nL\\n episcopal scribe at Pamiers naively wrote that a prisoner confessed of \n[his own accord "after he was taken down from the torture." 54 \n\nSome victims were listed as "confessed without torture" after \nexposure to only one instrument, a spiked iron press that crushed the \nlegs. Friedrich von Spee, a Jesuit who acted as confessor for condemned \npitches and developed some compassion for them, wrote of this \npractice: "And they call that \'Confessed without torture\' ! What kind of \ninsight can those have who lack all understanding of such pains? How \ntan outstandingly learned men judge and discriminate when they \ncannot understand the language, the specialists\' jargon, of the inquisi- \ntors? " In his Cautio Criminalis, von Spee wrote: \n\nWhy do you search so diligently for sorcerers? I will show you at once \nwhere they are. Take the Capuchins, the Jesuits, all the religious \norders, and torture them they will confess. If some deny, repeat it a few \ntimes they will confess. Should a few still be obstinate, exorcise them, \nshave them, only keep on torturing they will give in. If you want more, \ntake the Canons, the Doctors, the Bishops of the Church they will \nconfess. s$ \n\nAnother unusual churchman, Bernard Delicieux, was excom- \n\n\n\n443 \n\n\n\nInquisition \n\n\n\nHenri Boguet \n\nHighly active \ninquisitorial judge \nwhose book, Discours \ndes sorciers (1590) \nbecame a standard \nreference. \n\n\n\nmunicated, arrested, tortured, and burned alive for expressing the \nopinion that St. Peter and St. Paul, if tried by the Inquisition\'s \nmethods, would certainly be convicted of heresy. 56 \n\nInquisitors were placed entirely above the law by Pope Innocent \nIV in his bull of 1252, Ad extirpanda. 57 Every ruler and citizen must \nassist them on pain of excommunication. Resistance could place the \nwhole community under interdict, or force payment of heavy fines. \nAny individual fined by the Inquisition could be held in prison until he \npaid, or died. Torture was officially sanctioned in 1257 and remained \na legal recourse of the church for five and a half centuries until it was \nabolished by Pope Pius VII in 1816. 58 \n\nThe victims in those five and a half centuries were literally \ncountless. Official burnings were only a beginning. There were also \nthe disrupted, starving families; unrecorded suicides; unofficial lynch- \nings; hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, who died unnoticed in \nthe papal crusades against heretical groups. There were late-Renais- \nsance witch hunts in Protestant countries, which had no formal \nconnection with the Inquisition but certainly took their impetus from it. \n\nThe chronicler of Treves reported that in the year 1 586, the entire \nfemale population of two villages was wiped out by the inquisitors, \nexcept for only two women left alive. 59 Two other villages were \ndestroyed completely and erased from the map. 60 A hundred and \nthirty-three persons were burned in a single day at Quedlinburg in \n1589, out of a town of 12,000. Henri Boguet said Germany in 1590 \nwas "almost entirely occupied with building fires (for witches); and \nSwitzerland has been compelled to wipe out many of her villages on \ntheir account. Travelers in Lorraine may see thousands and thousands \nof the stakes to which witches are bound." 61 \n\nIn 1 524, one thousand witches died at Como. 62 Strasbourg burned \nfive thousand in a period of 20 years. 63 The Senate of Savoy \ncondemned 800 witches at one time. Parame stated that over thirty \nthousand were executed in the 1 5 th century. 64 Nicholas Remy said \nhe personally sentenced 800 witches in 1 5 years and in one year alone \nforced sixteen witches to suicide. A bishop of Bamberg claimed 600 \nwitches in 10 years; a bishop of Nancy, 800 in 16 years; a bishop of \nWurtzburg, 1900 in 5 years. Five hundred were executed within \nthree months at Geneva and 400 in a single day at Toulouse. The city \nof Treves burned 7,000 witches. The Lutheran prelate Benedict \nCarpzov, who claimed to have read the Bible 53 times, sentenced \n20,000 devil-worshippers. Even relatively permissive England killed \n30,000 witches between 1542 and 1736. The slaughter went on \nthroughout Christian Europe for nearly five centuries. 65 \n\nMass burnings on the Iberian peninsula were known as autos-de-fe \n(acts of faith). They were held once a month on the average, usually \non a Sunday or holiday so all could attend; to stay away was thought \nsuspicious. Sometimes the spectators were invited to participate, as in \nthe diversion genially known as "shaving the new Christians." This \n\n\n\n444 \n\n\n\nmeant setting fire to the hair or beards of those waiting their turn at Inquisition \n\nthe stake. 66 \n\nWholesale burnings in Germany are suggested by the observation ^^^^^^^^^^ \nof a visitor to Wolfenbuttel in 1 590: there were so many stakes to \nburn the witches that the place of execution resembled a small forest. \nThe executioner of Neisse in Silesia invented an oven in which he \nroasted to death forty-two women and young girls in one year. Within \nnine years he had roasted over a thousand persons, including children \nj two to four years old. 67 \n\nInquisitors were empowered to absolve each other, their offi- \ncers, torturers, and executioners, of blood guilt for their victims\' deaths, \nwhether in the prison, in the torture chamber, or at the stake. 68 They \nalso forced the condemned witches to recite: "I free all men, especially \nthe ministers and magistrates, of the guilt of my blood; I take it wholly \nupon myself, my blood be upon my own head." Some witches even \nwere made to repudiate the more impossible confessions extorted by \ntorture, as a suicidal device: "Through the temptation of the devil I \nmade up that confession on purpose to destroy my own life, being \nweary of it, and choosing rather to die than live." These abject \nrecitations preceded the trip to the stake, for it was common practice \n| to silence witches on their way to execution, either by wooden gags, or \nby cutting out their tongues, to prevent communication with the \ncrowd. 69 \n\nInquisitors didn\'t want to give witches a chance to reveal that they \nhad been raped in prison, the usual practice of torturers and their \nassistants during preliminary "stripping." 70 By the curious morality of \nthe day, outrage could be excited by sexual "irregularities" although \nspectacles of hideous torment were received without serious objection. \nThe people of Toulouse gathered evidence against an inquisitor \nnamed Foulques de Saint-George to prove he arrested women for the \nsole purpose of abusing them sexually. 71 Apparently this was consid- \nered worse than torturing them. \n\nSome records hint that executioners could indulge their lusts as \nlong as they were circumspect. The day in 1 589 at Quedlinburg, 133 \nwitches were burned and four inexplicably disappeared. "Four beautiful \ngirls were spared by the executioner, who gave out that the devil had \nspirited them away." 72 They were never seen again. One can well \nimagine who this "devil" was and what happened to the poor girls \nbefore they were finally murdered. \n\nIt can hardly be doubted that a major driving force of all witch \nhunts was sadistic sexual perversion. Torturers liked to attack wom- \nen\'s breasts and genitals with pincers, pliers, and red-hot irons. Under \nthe Inquisition\'s rules, little girls were prosecuted and tortured for \nI witchcraft a year earlier than little boys at 9 1 /2, as opposed to 10 Vi for \nwys. Witch hunting generally was directed against the female sex, \nand the abject helplessness of imprisoned and tortured women invari- \nably encouraged sexual abuse along with every other kind of abuse. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n445 \n\n\n\nInquisition Late in the 14th century it became a rule that prisoners in solitary \n\nconfinement (usually women) could be visited in their cells by \n^^^m^^^^mm "zealous Catholics" (always men; female visitors were not allowed). 73 \n\nOne inquisitorial judge, Dietrich Flade, experienced a revulsion \nfor his lifework and dared to say openly that the confessions wrung \nfrom his victims were false, due only to their agony. His archbishop had \nFlade arrested and put on the rack himself until he admitted having \nsold his soul to Satan; then he was burned. 74 \n\nAnother who ran into trouble for speaking too freely was Peter the \nPrecentor of Paris, who said the Inquisition blackmailed rich people \nand falsely accused and arrested "certain honest matrons" who "refused \nto consent to the lasciviousness of priests." 75 Civil magistrates who \ncriticized the Inquisition often found themselves in its dungeons. When \nthe governor of Albi defended his people against the inquisitors in \n1306, letters were forged and "discovered" in church records to remove \nhim from office on the ground that his grandfather was a convicted \nheretic. 76 \n\nPredictably, inquisitors often went in fear of their own lives, \nappearing in public with escorts of armed guards. Some were attend- \ned by small armies of toughs whose disruptive behavior was absolved by \ntheir masters, so they could literally get away with murder, robbery, \nand rape; they were "above the law." 77 Many inquisitors wore armor \nunder their habits and tested all their food for poison. Torquemada\'s \nchief protege Pedro Arbues was assassinated by relatives of some of his \nvictims in a church in Aragon as he left his guards and went alone to \nthe altar to receive the sacrament. During the 19th century, Pedro \nArbues was canonized as a saint by Pope Pius IX. 78 \n\nAnother inquisitor-saint was Peter Martyr (Piero da Verona), \nwhose case has never been adequately explained. He was so zealous \nin Lombardy as to embarrass even the church; apparently it was decided \nthat he would be more useful dead than alive. In 1252 he was \nassassinated, and within a year he was canonized the fastest creation of \na saint on record. His killers were captured but not prosecuted. One \nof them later became an inquisitor himself. Another entered the \nDominican order, died in old age, and was canonized as St. Acerinus; \nhis portrait appeared in a stall of Peter Martyr\'s own church in 1505. A \nthird conspirator was arrested and imprisoned by the Inquisition 43 \nyears after the murder, possibly because he was beginning to talk too \nmuch. 79 \n\nAnother curious case was that of the heretic who nearly became a j \nsaint, Armanno Pongilupo, a high-ranking official of the Catharan \nsect at Ferrara in the 1 3th century. Pretending devout Catholicism, \nPongilupo secretly gave aid to imprisoned heretics. He played the \npart of piety so well that after his death, altars and images were dedicated i \nto him; he received a magnificent tomb in the cathedral; stories were \ntold of his miraculous cures of the sick, the lame, and the blind. \nFerrara\'s citizens demanded his canonization, but the church re- \n\n\n\n446 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nfused, ordering that his remains be exhumed and burned for his heresy. Inquisition \n\nFerrara would not comply. The cathedral was placed under interdict \n\nand its chapter was excommunicated. Arguments about Pongilupo ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ndragged on for 33 years. Finally, the inquisitor Guido da Vincenza \n\nended the matter by having Pongilupo\'s bones burned, his altars \n\ndestroyed, and his heirs deprived of their property which naturally \n\nreverted to the church. Guido was rewarded with the episcopate of \n\nFerrara. 80 \n\nThe Inquisition was not organized to administer justice; it was \norganized to enrich the church and silence its critics. Lea says, "All \nthe safeguards which human experience had shown to be necessary in \njudicial proceedings of the most trivial character were deliberately cast \naside in these cases, where life and reputation and property through \nthree generations were involved. Every doubtful point was decided \n\'in favor of the faith\'. . . . Had the proceedings been public, there might \nhave been some check upon this hideous system, but the Inquisition \nshrouded itself in the awful mystery of secrecy until after sentence had \nbeen awarded and it was ready to impress the multitude with the \nfearful solemnities of the auto da fe." 81 \n\nThe Inquisition remained active until 1834, especially in Central \nand South America, where "heathen" natives were tortured and \nburned for crimes against the true faith, such as not believing in it. 82 \nMayan scribes in Central America wrote: "Before the coming of the \nSpaniards, there was no robbery or violence. The Spanish invasion was \nthe beginning of tribute, the beginning of church dues, the beginning \nof strife." 83 Catholic fathers of the mission of San Francisco burned \nmany Indian "witches" before the tribes were sufficiently subdued to \naccept God\'s word. 84 Lea said, "An inquisitor seems to have been \nregarded as a necessary portion of the missionary outfit." 85 \n\nEven in the present century, Catholic authorities have tried to \npresent the Inquisition in an undeservedly flattering light. Cardinal \nLepicier, expressly supported by Pope Pius X, declared the church\'s \nreign of terror was right, just because the church did it. "The naked \nfact that the Church, of her own authority, has tried heretics and \ncondemned them to be delivered to death, shows that she truly has \npie right of killing. . . . [W]ho dares to say that the Church has erred in a \nblatter so grave as this?" 86 \n\nIn fact, many have dared to say so. Leland wrote: "When people \nbelieve, or make believe, in a thing so very much as to torture like \ndevils and put to death hundreds of thousands of fellow-beings, mostly \nhelpless and poor old women, not to mention many children, it \nsecomes a matter of very serious import to all humanity to determine \n:>nce for all whether the system or code according to which this was \ndone was absolutely right for ever, or not." 87 Anthropologist Jules \nHenry said, "Organized religion, which likes to fancy itself the \nTiother of compassion, long ago lost its right to that claim by its \njrganized support of organized cruelty." 88 Coulton said of the \n\n\n\n447 \n\n\n\nInquisition Inquisition, "History affords few plainer examples of the demoralizing \n\neffects of absolute power upon fairly ordinary men." 89 And Vetter \n\n^ wm mm pointed out that the system that created such horrors may be still \ndangerous: \n\nHave religious institutions been any more humane in the process of \nconsolidating their power than has secular machinery similarly occu- \npied? The taste for slaughter exhibited by the sons of the Prophet was \nmore than matched by that of Christians who liquidated heathen and \nheretic. . . . The cultural backgrounds of the past and current generation \nof political dictators provides interesting material for speculation. Mus- \nsolini, Franco, Salazar, Hitler, Peron and almost without exception the \nLatin-American dictators were or are Roman Catholics, at least in their \neducation and upbringing. And Stalin had considerable training for the \npriesthood of an equally dictatorial church. Confronted with such facts \none is compelled at least to ask himself what kind of causal sequences are \nhere suggested. . . . \n\nIn both Islam and Christendom the naive believers have over long \nperiods been taught that it was their duty to slaughter the unbeliever, or \nwhoever refused to accept their particular version of divine guidance. \nThey have not had a change of heart; they have just been shorn of the \npowers for mischief. * \n\nIt is unsettling to realize that such powers for mischief could yet \nbe revived. The edicts that established the Inquisition have never been \nrepealed. They are "officially still part of the Catholic faith, and were \nused as justification for certain practices as recently as 1969." 91 \n\nJulian Huxley deplored the "pestilent doctrine on which all the \nchurches have insisted, that honest disbelief in their more or less \nastonishing creeds is a moral offense . . . deserving and involving the \nsame future retribution as murder and robbery." In his opinion, the \nworst visions of hell would seem pale beside a comprehensive vision of \nChristianity\'s gory history. 92 Such history should be remembered, on \nthe old principle that those who cannot remember their history are \ncondemned to repeat it. \n\nI.

Io represented the horned, milk-giving, \nlunar Triple Goddess, as shown by her sacred colors. She turned \nherself from white to red to black, the hues of the Virgin, Mother, and \nCrone (see Gunas). 1 \n\nThe apocryphal story that Hera sent a gadfly to sting Io, to send \nJher wandering all over the world, was a Hellenic myth invented to \nexplain the universality of the worship of the white Moon-cow. Since \nHera was herself the same Goddess, her alleged jealousy of Io was a \npatriarchal fiction. Some said Hera placed Io under the guardianship of \nhundred-eyed Argus Panoptes ("All-Eyes"), an allegory of the moon \ntraveling under the many-eyed gaze of the starry sky. 2 \n\n1.

In many mythologies she \npersonified the bridge between earth and heaven, the Rainbow Bridge \nof Norse paganism, the Necklace of Ishtar in Mesopotamia, the Road \nof the Gods in Japan, the Kinvad Bridge in Persia. 1 \n\nGreeks said the rainbow symbolized the Goddess Iris, "Source of \nthe waters from on high," mother of Love. 2 Like the part of the eye \nnamed after her, she was the Kore, Virgin, or Female Soul, a form of \nthe Great Shakti who was both the organ of sight and the visible \nworld that it saw. Her spectrum spanned all possible colors. The same \nseven-color spectrum was shown on the seven-stage ziggurats of \nMesopotamia, signifying the seven planetary spheres, with a symbolic \nascent to the Seventh Heaven as part of the initiatory pilgrimage. 3 \n\n1.

The bards maintained that even married ladies should be \nfree to take lovers, as under the old pagan system.

She was also the Great Whore, described in Revelation 17:5 \nas Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots. Another of her titles was \nthe Goddess Har, who called herself the compassionate prostitute. \nMen communed with her through the sexual rites of her harlot- \npriestesses. 1 See Prostitution. \n\nBabylonian scriptures called Ishtar the Light of the World, Leader \nof Hosts, Opener of the Womb, Righteous Judge, Lawgiver, Goddess \n\n\n\n450 \n\n\n\nof Goddesses, Bestower of Strength, Framer of All Decrees, Lady of Ishtar \n\nVictory, Forgiver of Sins, etc. 2 Much of the liturgical flattery addressed \n\nto God in the Old Testament was plagiarized from Babylonian prayers ^^^^^^^^^^ m \nto Ishtar. One example: \n\nWho dost make the green herb to spring up, mistress of mankind! Who \nhast created everything, who dost guide aright all creatures! Mother \nIshtar, whose power no god can approach! A prayer will I utter; may she \n\ndo unto me what seems good unto her O my mistress, make me to \n\nknow my deed, establish for me a place of rest! Absolve my sins, lift up my \nface! 3 \n\nA Babylonian prayer that obviously prefigured the prayers and \npsalms of biblical writers, even the biblical theology, said to the Goddess: \n"0 Thou art adorable, who givest salvation, life, and justice, vivify \nmy name." 4 Like the Old Testament God, Ishtar was the Mighty One, \nwinner of battles and overthrower of mountains. 5 She said: \n\nIn the brilliant heavens, to give omens in abundance, I appear, I appear in \nperfection. With exultation in my supremacy, with exultation do I, a \nGoddess, walk supreme; Ishtar, the Goddess of evening, am I; Ishtar, the \nGoddess of morning, am I; Ishtar, who opens the portals of heaven, in \nmy supremacy. The heavens I destroy, the earth I devastate, in my \nsupremacy. Who rises resplendent on the firmament of heaven, in- \nvoked above and below, in my supremacy. The mountain I sweep away \naltogether, in my supremacy. The great wall of the mountain am I, \ntheir great foundation am I, in my supremacy. 6 \n\nA long Babylonian prayer presents numerous metaphors and \nliturgical phrases later copied by Jewish priests on behalf of their god: \n\nI beseech thee, Lady of ladies, Goddess of goddesses, Ishtar, queen of all \ncities, leader of all men. Thou art the light of the world, thou art the \nlight of heaven . . . .Supreme is thy might, O Lady, exalted art thou above \nall gods. Thou renderest judgment and thy decision is righteous; unto \nthee are subject the laws of the earth and the laws of heaven, the laws of \nthe temple and of the shrine, and the laws of the private apartment and \nof the secret chamber. Where is the place where thy name is not, and \nwhere is the spot where thy commandments are not known? At thy \nname the earth and the heavens shake, and the gods they tremble; the \nspirits of heaven tremble at thy name and the men hold it in awe. Thou \nart great, thou art exalted; all the men ofSumer, and all creatures, and all \nmankind glorify thy name. With righteousness dost thou judge the \ndeeds of men, even thou; thou lookest upon the oppressed and to the \ndowntrodden thou bringest justice every day. How long, Queen of \nHeaven and Earth, how long, how long, Shepherdess of pale-faced men, \nwilt thou tarry? How long, O Queen whose feet are not weary and \nwhose knees make haste? How long, Lady of Hosts, Lady of Battles? \nGlorious one whom all the spirits of heaven fear, who subduest all \nangry gods; mighty above all rulers, who holdest the reins of kings. \nOpener of the womb of all women, great is thy light. Shining light of \nheaven, light of the world, enlightener of all the places where men dwell, \nwhogatherest together the hosts of the nations. Goddess of men, \n\n\n\n451 \n\n\n\nIshtar divinity of women, thy counsel passeth understanding. Where thou \n\nglancest the dead come to life, and the sick rise and walk; and the mind \n\n^^_^^____^^_ that is distressed is healed when it looks upon thy face. How long, O Lady, \n\nshall mine enemy triumph over me? Command, and at thy command \nthe angry god will turn back. Ishtar is great! Ishtar is Queen! My Lady is \nexalted, my Lady is Queen. 7 \n\nAkkadian sources show that Ishtar was the same Great Goddess \nrevered all over the Near East under such names as Dea Syria, Astarte, \nCybele, Aphrodite, Kore, Mari, etc.: \n\nPraise Ishtar, the most awesome of the Goddesses, revere the queen of \nwomen, the greatest of the deities. She is clothed with pleasure and \nlove. She is laden with vitality, charm, and voluptuousness. In lips she is \nsweet; life is in her mouth. At her appearance rejoicing becomes full. \n\nShe is glorious The fate of everything she holds in her hand. . . . \n\nIshtar to her greatness who can be equal? Strong, exalted, splendid \nare her decrees. . . . Ishtar among the gods, extraordinary is her station. \nRespected is her word; it is supreme over them. She is their queen; \nthey continually cause her commands to be executed. All of them bow \ndown before her. 8 \n\nThe powers of the underworld bowed down before her when \nshe went underground to rescue her son-lover Tammuz, as her Sumeri- \nan forerunner Inanna rescued the same son-lover, Dumuzi. She said \nto the seven gatekeepers: "If thou openest not the gate so that I cannot \nenter, I will smash the door, I will shatter the bolt, I will smash the \ndoorpost, I will move the doors, I will raise up the dead, eating the \nliving, so that the dead will outnumber the living." 9 This threat was \ntypical of Ishtar\'s dark underworld twin, Eresh-kigal, the Death-goddess \nwho had power to deprive the heavenly gods of their sacrificial \nfood. 10 Ishtar\'s temporary departure caused sterility and suspension of \nsexual activities over the whole earth: "After the Lady Ishtar has \ndescended, the bull no longer mounts the cow, the ass no longer bends \nover the she-ass, and the man no longer bends over the woman in the \nstreet: the man slept in his place, the woman slept alone." n \n\nThis Descent into Hell was a perilous but necessary part of the \nsacred drama, lasting three days and culminating in the Day of Joy, \nwhen the god was restored to life. 12 This inaugurated a new year after \npenitential atonement and sacrifice. "It is on New Year\'s Day that \nIshtar lies with Tammuz, and the king reproduces this mythical hiero- \ngamy by consummating the ritual union with the Goddess [i.e., with \nthe hierodule who represents her on earth] in a secret chamber of the \ntemple, where the nuptial bed of the Goddess stands." n \n\nGilgamesh said the Goddess was cruel to her lovers, since each in \nturn personified the dying god who refreshed the earth\'s fertility with \nhis blood. 14 When the god was incarnate in bulls, the animals were \nemasculated and their severed genitals thrown to the Goddess\'s \nimage, a rite "probably derived from the rite of self-emasculation which \nhad been practiced in honor of Ishtar." 15 Ishtar\'s priestesses apparently \n\n\n\n452 \n\n\n\nperformed some version of the rite each year in the temple of Jerusa- \nlem, where the virgin form of the Goddess was called Mari, Mari-Anna, \nor Miriam, and her holy women annually wailed for the sacrificial death \nof Tammuz (Ezekiel 8:14).

She was the Goddess from whom all becoming arose." \' As the \nCreatress, she gave birth to the sun "when he rose upon this earth for \nthe first time." 2 Her title, "Giver of Life," was applied also to the queen \nmother of Egypt. 5 \n\nIn her Roman mysteries, Isis was addressed as "the One Who is \nAll." Lucius\'s hymn to her said: \n\nO Thou holy and eternal Savior of the human race. . . . Thou bestowest a \nmother\'s tender affections on the misfortunes of unhappy mortals. . . . \nThou dispellest the storms of life and stretchest forth thy right hand of \nsalvation, by which Thou unravellest even the inextricably tangled web \nof Fate. . . . Thou turnest the earth in its orb; Thou givest light to the sun; \nThou rulest the world; Thou treadest Death underfoot. To Thee the \nstars are responsive; by Thee the seasons turn and the gods rejoice and the \nelements are in subjection. . . . lam too feeble to render Thee suffi- \ncient praise. . . . But, a pious though poor worshipper, 1 shall essay to do all \nwithin my power; Thy divine countenance and most holy deity I shall \nguard and keep forever hidden in the secret place of my heart. * \n\nAnother devout Roman Isis-worshipper, Apuleius, quoted her \nresponse to him, when he addressed her under several other Goddess- \n\n\n\nnames: \n\n\n\nlam Nature, the parent of things, the sovereign of the elements, the \nprimary progeny of time, the most exalted of the deities, the first of the \nheavenly gods and goddesses, the queen of the dead, the uniform \ncountenance; manifested alone and under one form. . . .At my will the \nplanets of the sky, the wholesome winds of the seas, and the mournful \nsilences of hell are disposed; my name, my divinity is adored through- \nout the world, in divers manners, in variable customs, and by many names. \nFor the Phrygians that are the first of all men call me the Mother of \nthe gods ofPessinus; the Athenians, which are sprung from their own \nsoil, Cecropian Minerva; the Cyprians, which are girt about by the sea, \nPaphian Venus; the Cretans, which bear arrows, Dictynian Diana; the \nSicilians, which speak three tongues, infernal Proserpine; the Eleusinians, \ntheir ancient goddess Ceres; some Juno, others Bellona, others Hecate, \nothers Ramnusie . . . the Egyptians, skilled in ancient lore, worship me \nwith proper ceremonies, and call me by my true name, Queen Isis. s \n\n\n\nLucius of Patrae \n\nAuthor of a lost \nMetamorphoses \nwhich furnished a \nprecedent and basic \nmaterial for the \nMetamorphoses of \nLucius Apuleius, a \ndevotee of Isis and \nPlatonic philosopher of \nthe 2nd century a.d. \n\n\n\n453 \n\n\n\nIsis Aristides also was initiated into the Mysteries of Isis, and spoke \n\nof a mystical experience during which he saw, coming from Isis, "a \n\n_^ m ^ m ^ BB Light and other unutterable things conducing to salvation." To be \ninitiated into her cult brought a privileged status after death (an idea \ncopied later by Christians): "Isis, the \'eternal savior of the race of \nmen,\' promises her votary: Thou shalt live in blessedness; thou shalt \nlive glorious under my protection. And when thou hast finished thy \nlife-course and goest down to the underworld, even there in that lower \nworld thou shalt see me shedding light in the gloom of Acheron and \nreigning in the inmost regions of Styx; thou thyself shalt inhabit the \nElysian Fields and shalt continually offer worship to me, ever \ngracious.\'" 6 \n\nEgyptians addressed her as "Mistress of the gods, thou bearer of \nwings, thou lady of the red apparel, queen of the crowns of the South \nand North, only One . . . superior to whom the gods cannot be, thou \nmighty one of enchantments (or, Words of Power) . . . thou who art \npre-eminent, mistress and lady of the tomb, Mother in the horizon of \nheaven . . . Praise be unto thee, O Lady, who art mightier than the \ngods, words of adoration rise unto thee from the Eight Gods of \nHermopolis. The living souls who are in their hidden places praise \nthe mystery of thee, O thou who art their mother, thou source from \nwhich they sprang, who makest for them a place in the hidden \nUnderworld, who makest sound their bones and preservest them from \nterror, who makest them strong in the abode of everlastingness." Her \nname may have come from Ashesh, meaning both "pouring out" and \n"supporting," an implication that her divine essence (blood or milk) \nkept the gods and all other creatures alive. 7 \n\nIsis was the Egyptian throne. Pharaohs sat on her lap, protected by \nher arms or wings. 8 The symbol she carried on her crown was the \nmu\'at, "foundation of the throne," which also represented her alter ego \nMaat, the motherhood-principle called Right, Justice, Truth, or the \nAll-seeing Eye. 9 An Egyptian hymn was copied into the Bible: "Right \nand justice are the foundation of thy throne" (Psalms 89:14). \n\nHermetic texts said Isis revealed the mysteries of the stars to God, \n\nwho was her son. 10 She also provided a model for Moses\'s miracle of \n\nSign of his stopping the waters, which she did quite casually on her way to Byblos; \n\nand Joshua\'s miracle of stopping the sun, which she did while \nbringing Horus back to life. 11 Since Horus was the sun Ra or Osiris in \nthe form of Isis\'s infant an interruption of his life would naturally \nhave caused the sun to stand still in heaven. \n\nIsis and her dark twin sister Nephthys were Egyptian versions of \nthe familiar creating-and-destroying Goddess, Mother of Life and \nCrone of Death. Egyptians called her by many names: Mut, Hathor, \nBast, Maat, Heqit, Sekhmet, Sati, Neith, etc. Some of her destructive \nfunctions were described in the Book of the Dead: \n\nTerrible one, lady of the rain-storm, destroyer of the souls of men, \ndevourer of the bodies of men, orderer, producer, and maker of \n\n\n\n454 \n\n\n\n\nslaughter . . . Hewer-in-pieces in blood, Ahibit, lady of hair. . . . Fire-lover, \npure one, lover of slaughterings, cutter off of heads, devoted one, lady \nof the Great House . . . her name is Clother, hider of her creations, \n\nconqueror of hearts, swallower of them Knife which cutteth when \n\nits name is uttered, slayer of those who approach thy flame. 12 \n\nIsis swallowed Osiris the savior and brought him back to life. \nHe was reincarnated as the child Horus, or else as the ithvphallic moon- \ngod Min, or Menu, "He who impregnates his mother." n He was \nannually torn to pieces and reassembled except for his lost penis. Isis \nmade him a new penis of clay, then gave it and him new life by \ninvoking her own holy names as life-giver and death-giver: "Behold, I \nhave found thee lying there. Weary is the great one . . . . O Osiris, \nlive, stand up thou unfortunate one that liest there! I am Isis. I am \nNephthys." H So Osiris stood up, and lived, and mated with his \nGoddess, and life went on. Osiris-Min\'s counterpart Adonis was similar- \nly reborn from the Goddess as Priapus and was similarly associated \nwith spring floods. 15 \n\nSome said the annual Nile flood was caused by a teardrop from \nIsis\'s eye as she raised her lament for the dead god. The Nile festival \ntook place on the "Night of the Tear-Drop," unwittingly preserved by \nMoslems as the June festival of Lelat al-Nuktah, "Night of the \nDrop." Worshippers said to the Goddess: "Thou givest life unto the \nflocks and herds, all the land drinks thee when thou descendest . . . \nwhen thou comest the whole land rejoices. Thou art the bringer of food, \nthou art the mighty one of meat and drink, thou art the creator of all \ngood things. Thou fillest the storehouses, thou heapest high with corn \nthe granaries, and thou hast care for the poor and needy." 16 \n\nIsis was worshipped throughout the Greco-Roman world, "from \nAlexandria to Aries, from the outskirts of the Sahara to the isle of \nBritain, from the mountains of Asturias to the mouths of the Dan- \nube." 17 Prevalence of the fairy tale "The Witch in the Stone Boat" \nshows how widely Isis\'s cult traveled, for the "witch" was none other \nthan she; each of her temples featured a carved stone moon-boat \ncontaining her figure, which Christians called a witch or demoness. In \npagan times, Isis\'s boat had its own special holiday on the 5th of \nMarch, the Navigium Isidis, Blessing of the Vessel of Isis. 18 \n\nIsis\'s cult came to Rome about 80 B.C., attained great popularity in \nthe reign of Vespasian, and flourished throughout the empire until it \nwas ousted by Christianity four centuries later. The Goddess herself was \nnot so much ousted as absorbed. Her identification with the virgin \nMary was part of the syncretic development of the Madonna cult. Some \nearly Christians in Rome called themselves Pastophori, a title of \n"shepherds" or "servants of Isis," which evolved intopa5tors. 19 \n\nThe story of Mary\'s Egyptian journey with her child seems to have \nbeen devised not only to fulfill the scripture, "Out of Egypt have I \ncalled my son" (Matthew 2:1 5), but also to justify the extensive \nidentifications between Isis and Mary. One legend said Mary and \n\n\n\nIsis \n\n\n\nBook of the Dead. \n\nCommon name for the \ncollection of \nEgyptian funerary \npapyri written \nbetween 1500 and 1350 \nB.C., including \nVignettes, Hymns, \nChapters, and \ndescriptive Rubrics. \nAmong the best- \npreserved, and most \ntypical, copies of the \nTheban Recension of \nthe Book of the \nDead is the much- \nstudied Papyrus of \nAni. \n\n\n\n455 \n\n\n\nIsra-EI \n\n\n\nJesus took refuge in the holy tree at Mataria, the sycamore of Isis- \nHathor, Goddess of Dendera, the Shrine of the Tree. 20 Isis was \n"Destiny," and so was Mary the triple Moerae. "The tree is a symbol \nof destiny because it is rooted in the depths. But what is more \nimportant is that it grows into time, ramifies its branches like a family \ntree." 21 Mataria was long known as an Egyptian name of the \nGoddess who was also Mata-Meri, or Mari. 22 \n\nPictures and sculptures wherein [Isis] is represented in the act of suckling \nher child Horus formed the foundation for the Christian figures and \npaintings of the Madonna and Child. Several of the incidents oHhe \nwanderings of the Virgin with the Child in Egypt as recorded in the \nApocryphal Gospels reflect scenes in the life of Isis as described in the \ntexts found on the Metternich Stele, and many of the attributes of Isis, \nthe God-mother, the mother of Horus, andofNeith, the goddess of Sais, \nare identical with those of Mary the Mother of Christ. 23 \n\nAn Egyptian amulet in the British Museum shows the Goddess \n\nseated under her holy tree, giving birth to her divine child, and holding \n\nthe ankh in one hand. On the reverse is another ankh and the legend, \n\n"One God in heaven." Some suggest that the picture might represent \n\nthe birth of Buddha, but it is usually interpreted as the birth of \n\nChrist though its original was certainly a picture of Isis. 24 \n\n1.

Jacob was the "sup- \nplanter" who next took the name of the same divinity.

Hellenic myth interpreted this as punishment for a \nsin against Zeus, but the original story was one of sacred-king \nsacrifice, related to "the burning wheels rolled downhill at European \nmidsummer festivities, as a sign that the sun has reached its zenith \nand must now decline again." x \n\nIxion\'s name was akin to axis, the same as the Hindu Akshivan \nwho was an emanation of Shiva personifying the Axle of the World \n{aksha). 1 Thus Ixion was another of the gods whose death took place at \nthe hub of the universe, the axis mundi later assimilated to the cross \nof Christ. \n\n1.

One version said the male twin, Izanagi, reached \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ down from heaven and stirred the Deep with his spear. 1 \n\nThe pair were known as the Male Who Invites and the Female \nWho Invites. Their myth told how they discovered sex and used it to \nwork their creation magic: \n\nHis Augustness, the Male Who Invites, inquired of Her Augustness, the \nFemale Who Invites, "In what manner is your body made?" She \nreplied, "My body in its thriving grows, but there is one part that does not \ngrow together. "And His Augustness the Male who Invites said to her: \n"My body in its thriving also grows, but there is one part that grows in \nexcess. Therefore, would it not seem proper that I should introduce the \npart of my body in excess into the part of your body that does not grow to- \ngether, and so procreate territories?" \n\nHer Augustness the Female Who Invites said: "It would be well. " \nAnd His Augustness, the Male Who Invites, said to her: "Let us go \nround this August Heavenly Pillar, I and you, and when we shall have \ncome together let us in august union join our august parts. " She \nagreed . . . and where they met, Her Augustness the Female Who Invites \nsaid: "Ah! What a fair and lovely youth! Whereupon His Augustness \nthe Male Who Invites said: "Ah! What a fair and lovely maiden!" 2 \n\nThe earlier myths said Izanami gave birth to all things; but at a \nlater date, an imaginative revisionist took the initiative away from her. \nThe next installment said she was burned to death while giving birth \nto Fire; then she went into the underworld and became a Tiamat-like \nsea monster. Izanagi followed her, but she couldn\'t return to the \nupper world with him because she had eaten underworld fruit (the same \ntheme familiar in Greek myths of Persephone and Eurydice). \n\nIzanagi fled, horrified at his female twin\'s changed appearance. \nShe pursued him with an army of storm-demons, whom he foiled by \nthrowing them peaches, the yonic fruit of life, which they couldn\'t resist \nstopping to pick up. Then Izanagi performed magical purifications \nand developed the ability to give birth to beings. Amaterasu the sun \ngoddess was born from his left eye, a moon god from his right eye, \nand the dragon-slaying hero Susa-no-wo from his nose. The former \nCreatress Izanami, left behind in the underworld, also gave birth to \nmore deities but they were all evil spirits. 3 \n\nl.Larousse,403. 2. Campbell, Or.M., 467-68. 3.

Hjuki was derived from jakka, to assemble, to increase; \nBil from bila, to break up or dissolve. Thus the twins signified forces of \n\n\n\n458 \n\n\n\ncreation and destruction. 1 It was said their faces could be seen forever Jael \n\nin the markings on the moon.

A 20-year-old girl named Mary Spencer was convicted of \nwitchcraft because "on her way to the well for water, she often rolled \nher pail down the hill, running before it and in fun calling it to follow \nher." 3 That such apparently trivial actions invited serious charges, \neven death sentences, suggests that they must have been understood in \nsome way other than mere play. \n\n1.

At her \nFestival in early January she was addressed as Antevorta and Postvorta, \nthe Goddess Who Looks Forward and Backward, for January was the \n\n(gate" of the year, when the god of the Aeon died and was reborn from \nlotherTime. 1 \n\nAs Roman religion became more patriarchal, Juno\'s gate-keeping \npersona became an androgynous Janua-Janus, later was wholly mas- \nculinized as the two-faced god Janus to whom all gateways were sacred. \nWe was another form of the Petra, Pater, or Peter, keeper of the keys \n:o the Goddess\'s "Pearly Gate." \n\nThe Christian version of the janua coeli depicted heaven on one \n;ide, hell on the other. The "wrong" or "death" side of the Gate \nbecame known as janua diaboli, "the gate by which the Devil enters." \nSince the whole image was that of a yoni to begin with, it was almost \nnevitable that Christian fathers used janua diaboli as a common \nsynonym for "woman." 2 \n\n1.

His old shrine at Naples was converted into a saint\'s church, \nvhere a bottle of dried blood was reverently preserved and said to be \nhe blood of the saint. This blood would turn liquid when placed beside \nhe skull of a genuine martyr. Pope Pius II himself "infallibly" \nI ttested to the reality of this miracle. 1 \n\nNaturally there was no real St. Januarius; he was only another form \nif Peter, the "Petra" who guarded the heavenly gate (see Peter, \nlaint). As guardian of door and gateways he became the janitor \nneaning "doorkeeper" of heaven. 2 \n\n1. Brewster, 415. 2.

On the fourth day will take \nplace the return of Nabu." The man representing the god was always \npreceded by a jar-bearer, carrying the vessel of water that stood for \nthe god\'s seminal spirit, the medium of his union with the dread \nGoddess. 1 \n\nIn Egypt, the jar was the menat or moon-charm, represented in \nhieroglyphics as fluid pouring from a narrow phallic vessel into a \nwider, female pot or vase. As early as the 6th dynasty, the menat \nsignified the restoration of sexual capacities after rebirth. 2 Unlike \nChristians, who denied sexual activity in heaven (Matthew 22:30, Mark \n12:25, Luke 20:35), Egyptians believed there could be no heavenly \nbliss without sex. Even the Savior Osiris, reborn as "impregnator of his \nMother," followed the menat to his love-death. It was water in a \n"male vessel," the phallic jar. 3 \n\nBoth Osiris and Isis were represented by vessels of water, to merge \nin their mating as completely as two waters in a single jar. The \nconcept was the same as the Tantric image of sexual union blessed by \nthe god of love: a merging of bliss and the void, "like the pouring of \nwater into water." 4 \n\nSimilar imagery underlay creation myths like that of Ashurbani- \npal\'s Twelve Tablets, where the male celestial sea Apsu rained down \nfructifying waters into the sea-womb of Mother Tiamat, the nether sea. 5 \nBecause the ancients thought rain a kind of celestial semen, mytho- \nlogical heavenly fathers tended to be rain gods (e.g., Jupiter Pluvius). \nSince they weren\'t sure whether this fertile fluid from heaven should \nbe called semen or urine, the heavenly father sometimes made "golden \nrain," like the urine with which Zeus impregnated Danae, the \nEarth. 6 Uranus or "Father Heaven" was an archaic producer of \nfertilizing urine. \n\nIn India the spirit of love is still represented by a jar of water \nserving "in the place of a sacred image. The water is regarded, for the \nperiod of the worship, as a residence or seat (pitha) of the god." 7 The \nSanskrit word pitha recalls the Greek pithos or jar signifying rebirth in \nDemeter\'s Eleusinian Mysteries, when she was Mistress of Earth and \nSea and absorbed the substance of gods. 8 \n\nMysteries of the Cabiri in Phrygia and Samothrace worshipped \nDemeter Cabiria in conjunction with the Young God (Ganymede, \nDionysus, or Cabirius) in the form of a male jar-bearer, shown pouring \nwater into a maternal Pot, Vase, Cauldron, or Grail. He was the \nuniversal ephebe; the larger vessel was the universal mother. 9 Similar \n\n\n\n462 \n\n\n\nI mysteries of the two vessels were dramatized throughout the Middle \nj East, so the jar-bearer became the symbol of any dying savior-god \nenroute to his Fate. \n\n\\.Assyr.&Bab.

At first the artificial construct was used to avoid \nspeaking the "real" name of God, which carried a curse. Actually there \nwere many variations of the name, in many Semitic dialects: Yahu, \nJah, Jeud, leu, Yahweh, Jahveh, Yaho, Iao. 1 Another variation was \nJesus, a Latin form of Yeshua, Joshua, or Jeud. (See Yahweh.) \n\n1. Albright, 262. \n\n\n\nJesus ben Pandera \n\nCelsus and the Talmudic tradition mentioned Jesus, son of Pandera \nor Panthera, begotten by a Roman soldier on a Jewish prostitute, \nI Miriam of Magdala (Mary Magdalene), whose husband was a car- \npenter. 1 The word for carpenter, najjar, was applied to a sacred \nbrotherhood, the Nazarites or Nazorenes, who supported themselves \nby woodworking. 2 Jesus ben Pandera was called a najjar, a holy man. He \n| worked miracles, healed the sick, foretold the world\'s end. 3 Eventual- \nly he was executed, perhaps by hanging, through his own wish. \n\nSome said this ben Pandera or Bar-Panther was the grandfather of \nthe Virgin Mary. 4 Other Christian authorities, like Epiphanius, said \nhe was the paternal grandfather of the Christian Jesus which, obvious- \nly, contradicted the Virgin Birth myth. "Son of Pandera" was a title \nso firmly attached to Jesus that many Christian writers accepted it and \ntried to explain it. The name of Pandera as Jesus\'s father is traceable \nI back to the time of the Gospels and has "an equal claim to reliability." 5 \nLater Christians said the name was used by the Jews to discredit their \nsavior by calling him a whore\'s son who was executed as a criminal. \n\nThe "whore" called Miriam of Magdala seems to have been a \nsacred hierodule or Virgin Bride of God, dedicated to the temple \n{magdala). Since the oldest traditions associated Mary Magdalene with \nthe Holy Vase that represented Pandora, the Great Goddess entitled \n"All-Giver," some suggest that Pandera was a corrupt form of this title. 6 \nAnother theory said Jesus ben Pandera really meant Jesus, son of the \nVirgin (Parthenos), the latter being the usual title of a temple hiero- \ndule. 7 Or again, Pan-Thera could have meant Dionysus the son of \nPan, whose totem animal was a panther, or "all-beast." Jesus was \n\n\n\nvar. Panthera \n\n\n\n463 \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\n\n\nassimilated to the Dionysian savior. The story of his miracle at Cana \nwas directly modeled on a Dionysian rite of sacred marriage celebrated \nat Sidon; even the Gospels\' wording was copied from the festival of \nthe older god. 8 \n\nThese few garbled hints of Jesus\'s pagan background may have \nbeen greatly clarified by the hundreds of diverse Gospels extant in the \nfirst few centuries a.d., had not the early church seen fit to destroy them \nall. 9 \n\n1.

Smith, 2. \n\n\n\nOther versions of the \nname were Jaho, Iao, or \nIeuw, sometimes \ntitles of Zeus-Sabazius \nas the nocturnal sun \nand Lord of Death in \nthe underworld. 7 \nThe same god was \nSabaoth, the Jews\' \n"Lord of Hosts." The \nLatin name for this \nHeavenly Father came \nfrom the same root: \nIu-piter, Father leu. 8 \n\n\n\nBook of Enoch \n\nConsisting of three \nextant books and a \nlost fourth, the \nEnochian works \nwere written probably \nbetween the \nMaccabean age and the \nfirst century B.C. The \nchief subject is the \ncoming world\'s end \nand the reappearance of \nthe Messianic Son of \nMan, who resembles \nthe predicted final \navatar of Buddha \nappearing before \ndoomsday. \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\nThe Jesus who was called Christos, "Anointed," took his title from \nMiddle-Eastern savior-gods like Adonis and Tammuz, born of the \nVirgin Sea-goddess Aphrodite-Maria (Myrrha), or Ishtar-Mari (He- \nbrew Mariamne). Earlier biblical versions of the same hero were Joshua \nson of Nun (Exodus 33:11), Jehu son of Nimshi, whom Elijah \nanointed as a sacred king (1 Kings 19:16), and Yeshua son of Marah. \nThe Book of Enoch said in the 2nd century B.C. that Yeshua or Jesus \nwas the secret name given by God to the Son of Man (a Persian title), \nand that it meant "Yahweh saves." \' \n\nIn northern Israel the name was written leu. 2 It was the same as \nIeud or Jeud, the "only-begotten son" dressed in royal robes and \nsacrificed by the god-king Isra-El. 3 Greek versions of the name were \nIasion, Jason, or Iasus the name of one of Demeter\'s sacrificed \nconsorts, killed by Father Zeus after the fertility rite that coupled him \nwith his Mother. 4 Iasus signified a healer or Therapeuta, as the \nGreeks called the Essenes, whose cult groups always included a man \nwith the title of Christos. 5 The literal meaning of the name was \n"healing moon-man," fitting the Hebrew version of Jesus as a son of \nMary, the almah or "moon-maiden." 6 (See Virgin Birth.) \n\nIt seems Jesus was not one person but a composite of many. He \nplayed the role of sacred king of the Jews who periodically died in an \natonement ceremony as surrogate for the real king. "The Semitic \nreligions practiced human immolations longer than any other reli- \ngion, sacrificing children and grown men in order to please sanguinary \ngods. In spite of Hadrian\'s prohibition of those murderous offerings, \nthey were maintained in certain clandestine rites." 9 The priesthood of \nthe Jewish God insisted that "one man should die for the people . . . \nthat the whole nation perish not" (John 1 1:50). Yahweh forgave no sins \nwithout bloodshed: "without shedding blood is no remission" (He- \nbrews 9:22). \n\nMiddle-Eastern traditions presented a long line of slain and canni- \nbalized Saviors extending back to prehistory. At first kings, they became \nking-surrogates or "sacred" kings as the power of real monarchies \n\n\n\n464 \n\n\n\ndeveloped. The Gospels\' Jesus was certainly not the first of them, Jesus Christ \n\nthough he may have been one of the last. One passage hints at a \n\nholy man\'s understandable fear of such brief, doomed eminence: ^^^^^^^^- \n\n"When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him \n\nby force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain \n\nhimself alone" (John 6:15). \n\nThis Jesus seems to have made little or no impression on his \ncontemporaries. No literate person of his own time mentioned him in \nany known writing. The Gospels were not written in his own time, nor \nwere they written by anyone who ever saw him in the flesh. The \nnames of the apostles attached to these books were fraudulent. The \nbooks were composed after the establishment of the church, some as \nlate as the 2nd century a.d. or later, according to the church\'s require- \nments for a manufactured tradition. 10 Most scholars believe the \nearliest book of the New Testament was 1 Thessalonians, written \nperhaps 5 1 a.d. by Paul, who never saw Jesus in person and knew no \ndetails of his life story. 11 \n\nThe details were accumulated through later adoption of the myths \nattached to every savior-god throughout the Roman empire. Like \nAdonis, Jesus was born of a consecrated temple maiden in the sacred \ncave of Bethlehem, "The House of Bread." 12 He was eaten in the \nform of bread, as were Adonis, Osiris, Dionysus, and others; he called \nhimself the bread of God (John 6:33). Like worshippers of Osiris, \nthose of Jesus made him part of themselves by eating him, so as to \nparticipate in his resurrection: "He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh \nmy blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him" (John 6:56). \n\nLike Attis, Jesus was sacrificed at the spring equinox and rose again \nfrom the dead on the third day, when he became God and ascended \nto heaven. Like Orpheus and Heracles, he "harrowed hell" and brought \na secret of eternal life, promising to draw all men with him up to glory \n(John 12:32). Like Mithra and all the other solar gods, he celebrated a \nbirthday nine months later at the winter solstice, because the day of \nhis death was also the day of his cyclic re-conception. See Attis. \n\nFrom the elder gods, Jesus acquired not only his title of Christos \nbut all his other titles as well. Osiris and Tammuz were called Good \nShepherd. Sarapis was Lord of Death and King of Glory. Mithra and \nHeracles were Light of the World, Sun of Righteousness, Helios the \nRising Sun. Dionysus was King of Kings, God of Gods. Hermes was \nthe Enlightened One and the Logos. Vishnu and Mithra were Son of \nMan and Messiah. Adonis was the Lord and the Bridegroom. Mot- \nAleyin was the Lamb of God. "Savior" (Soter) was applied to all of \nthem. \n\nMystery cults everywhere taught that ordinary men could be \npossessed by the spirits of such gods, and identified with them as \n"sons" or alter egos, as Jesus was. It was the commonly accepted way to \nacquire supernatural powers, as shown by some of the charms used \nby magicians: "Whatever I say must happen For I have taken to \n\n\n\n465 \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\n\n\nAulus Cornelius \nCelsus \n\nPatrician Roman \nscholar of the first \ncentury a.d., who wrote \nat length on the \nsubjects of medicine, \nagriculture, \nphilosophy, \njurisprudence, and \nreligion. \n\n\n\nmyself the power of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and of the great god- \ndemon Iao Ablanathanalba ... for 1 am the Son, I surpass the limit. . . . \nI am he who is in the seven heavens, who standeth in the seven \nsanctuaries; for I am the son of the living God. ... I have been united \nwith thy sacred form. I have been empowered by thy sacred name. I \nhave received the effluence of goodness, Lord, God of gods, King, \nDemon . . . having attained that nature equal to the God\'s." n \n\nThe skeptical Celsus noted that beggars and vagabonds throughout \nthe Empire were pretending to work miracles and become gods, \nthrowing fits, prophesying the end of the world, and aspiring to the \nstatus of saviors: \n\nEach has the convenient and customary spiel, "I am the god, " or "a son of \nGod, " or "a divine spirit, " and "I have come. For the world is about to \nbe destroyed, and you, men, because of your injustice, will go (with it). \nBut I wish to save, and you shall see me again coming back with \nheavenly power. Blessed is he who worships me now! On all others, both \ncities and countrysides, I shall cast eternal fire. And men who (now) \nignore their punishments shall repent in vain and groan, but those who \nbelieved in me I shall preserve immortal. " M \n\nOf course this "conspicuously false" doctrine was the central \nmessage of the Gospels too. Persian eschatology passing through a \nJewish-Essenic filter predicted "the Son of Man coming in a cloud \nwith power and great glory" (Luke 9:27, 21:27). Jesus promised the end \nof the world in his own generation. The rest of the Gospel material \nwas largely devoted to the miracles supposed to demonstrate his divine \npower, since religions generally "adduce revelations, apparitions, \nprophecies, miracles, prodigies and sacred mysteries that they may get \nthemselves valued and accepted." 1S Even these miracles were deriva- \ntive. Turning water into wine at Cana was copied from a Dionysian \nritual practiced at Sidon and other places. 16 In Alexandria the same \nDionysian miracle was regularly shown before crowds of the faithful, \nassisted by an ingenious system of vessels and siphons, invented by a \nclever engineer named Heron. 17 Many centuries earlier, priestesses at \nNineveh cured the blind with spittle, and the story was repeated of \nmany different gods and their incarnations. 18 Demeter of Eleusis \nmultiplied loaves and fishes in her role of Mistress of Earth and Sea. \nHealing the sick, raising the dead, casting out devils, handling poisonous \nserpents (Mark 16:18), etc., were so commonplace that Celsus \nscorned these "Christian" miracles as "nothing more than the common \nworks of those enchanters who, for a few oboli, will perform greater \ndeeds in the midst of the Forum. . . . The magicians of Egypt cast out \nevil spirits, cure diseases by a breath, and so influence some uncul- \ntured men, that they produce in them whatever sights and sounds they \nplease. But because they do such things shall we consider them the \nsons of God?" 19 \n\nMagicians often claimed that their prayers could bring flocks of \nsupernatural beings to their assistance. 20 Thus Jesus declared that his \n\n\n\n466 \n\n\n\n1 prayer could summon twelve legions (72,000) of guardian angels \n(Matthew 26:53). Magicians also communed with their followers by \nthe standard mystery-cult sacrament of bread-flesh and wine-blood. In \nI texts on magic, "a magician-god gives his own body and blood to a \nrecipient who, by eating it, will be united with him in love." 21 \n\nThe ability to walk on water was claimed by Far-Eastern holy men \nJ ever since Buddhist monks praised it as the mark of the true ascetic. 22 \nj The Magic Papyri said almost anyone could walk on water with the \nI help of "a powerful demon." 23 Impossibilities have always been the \nprops of religious credulity, as Tertullian admitted: "It is believable \nbecause it is absurd; it is certain because it is impossible." 24 \n\nHowever, repetitive miracles were not so believable as original \nones. Therefore early Christians insisted that all the older deities and \ntheir miracle-tales were invented by the devil, out of his foreknowledge \nof the true religion, so the faithful would be confused by past \n"imitations." 25 Pagan thinkers countered with the observation that \n"The Christian religion contains nothing but what Christians hold in \ncommon with heathens; nothing new, nor truly great." Even St. Augus- \ntine, finding the hypothesis of the devil\'s inventions hard to swallow, \nadmitted that "the true religion" was known to the ancients, and had \nexisted from the beginning of time, but it began to be called Christian \nafter "Christ came in the flesh." 26 \n\nNevertheless, adherents of the true religion violently disagreed \nas to the circumstances of its foundation. In the first few centuries a.d. \nthere were many mutually hostile Christian sects, and many mutually \ncontradictory Gospels. As late as 450, Bishop Theodore of Cyrrhus said \nthere were at least 200 different Gospels revered by the churches of \nhis own diocese, until he destroyed all but the canonical four. 27 The \nother Gospels were lost as stronger sects overwhelmed the weaker, \nwrecked their churches, and burned their books. 28 \n\nOne scripture, later thrown out of the canon, said Jesus was not \ncrucified. Simon of Cyrene suffered on the cross in his place, while \nJesus stood by laughing at the executioners, saying, "It was another . . . \nwho drank the gall and vinegar; it was not I ... it was another, \nSimon, who bore the cross on his shoulder. It was another upon whom \nthey placed the crown of thorns. But I was rejoicing in the height. . . . \nAnd I was laughing at their ignorance." 29 Believers in this scripture \nwere persecuted and forced to sign an abjuration reading: "I anathe- \nmatize those who say that Our Lord suffered only in appearance, and \nthat there was a man on the cross and another at a distance who \nlaughed." 30 \n\nSome Christians interpreted Jesus\'s noli me tangere ("Touch me \nnot") to mean he came back from death as an incorporeal spirit, after \nthe manner of other apotheosized heroes, such as the Irish hero \nLaegaire, who also told his people not to touch him. 31 Later, an \nunknown Gospel writer inserted the story of doubting Thomas, who \ninsisted on touching Jesus. This was to combat the heretical idea that \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagic Papyri \n\nCollections of \nexorcisms, invocations, \ncharms, and spells \nwidely circulated \nduring the early \nChristian era, used as \nbases for later \ngrimoires and \nHermetic texts. \n\n\n\n467 \n\n\n\nJesus Christ there was no resurrection in the flesh, and also to subordinate Jerusa- \n\nlem\'s municipal god Tammuz (Thomas) to the new savior (see \n\n^ m ^^^ Thomas, Saint). Actually, the most likely source of primary Christian \nmythology was the Tammuz cult in Jerusalem. Like Tammuz, Jesus \nwas the Bridegroom of the Daughter of Zion (John 12:1 5). Therefore \nhis bride was Anath, "Virgin Wisdom Dwelling in Zion," who was \nalso the Mother of God. 32 Her dove descended on him at his baptism, \nsignifying (in the old religion) that she chose him for the love-death. \nAnath broke her bridegroom\'s reed scepter, scourged him and pierced \nhim for fructifying blood. She pronounced his death curse, Mara- \nnatha (1 Corinthians 16:22). As the Gospels said of Jesus, Anath\'s \nbridegroom was "forsaken" by El, his heavenly father. 35 Jesus\'s cry to \nEl, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" seems to have \nbeen a line written for the second act of the sacred drama, the pathos \nor Passion (Mark 15:34). \n\nOf course this Passion was originally a sexual one. Jesus\'s last \nwords "It is consummated" (consummatum est) were interpreted as a \nsign that his work was finished, but could equally apply to his marriage \n(John 19:30). As a cross or pillar represented the divine phallus, so a \ntemple represented the body of the Goddess, whose "veil" (hymen) was \n"rent in the midst" as Jesus passed into death (Luke 23:45). As usual \nwhen the god disappeared into the underworld, the sun was eclipsed \n(Luke 23:44). In their ignorance of astronomical phenonema, Chris- \ntians claimed that the moon was full at the same time Easter is still a \nfull-moon festival though an eclipse of the sun can only occur at \nthe dark of the moon. 34 The full moon really meant impregnation of the \nGoddess. \n\nThe parting of Jesus\'s garment recalls the unwrapping of Osiris \nwhen he emerged from the tomb as the ithyphallic Min, "Husband \nof his Mother." If Jesus was one with his heavenly father, then he also \nmarried his mother and begot himself. A 4th-century scripture said in \nthe underworld he confronted his mother as Death, Mu} s She was also \nthe Bride disguised as Venus, the evening star, presiding over the \ndeath of the sun. Jews still recall her in a ritual greeting to the evening \nstar, "Come, O friend, let us welcome the Bride." 36 \n\nLike pagans, early Christians identified the Bride with the Mother. \nThey said Jesus "consummated on the cross" his union with Mary- \nEcclesia, his bride the church. Augustine wrote: "Like a bridegroom \nChrist went forth from his chamber, he went out with a presage of his \nnuptials. ... He came to the marriage bed of the cross, and there, in \nmounting it, he consummated his marriage . . . , he lovingly gave \nhimself up to the torment in place of his bride, and he joined himself to \nthe woman for ever." 37 John 19:41 says, "In the place where he was \ncrucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, \nwherein was never man yet laid." A garden was the conventional \nsymbol for the body of the mother/bride; and a new tomb was the virgin \nwomb, whence the god would be born again. On the third day, Jesus \n\n\n\n468 \n\n\n\nrose from the tomb/womb like Attis, whose resurrection was the Hilaria, Jesus Christ \n\nor Day of Joy. 38 Jesus\'s resurrection day was named after Eostre, the \n\nsame Goddess as Astarte, whom the Syrians called Mother Mari. 39 ^ -^_^__^__ \n\nThree incarnations of Mari, or Mary, stood at the foot of Jesus\'s \ni cross, like the Moerae of Greece. One was his virgin mother. The \nsecond was his "dearly beloved" (see Mary Magdalene). The third \nMary must have represented the Crone (the fatal Moera), so the \ntableau resembled that of the three Norns at the foot of Odin\'s sacrificial \ntree. The Fates were present at the sacrifices decreed by Heavenly \nFathers, whose victims hung on trees or pillars "between heaven and \nI earth." Up to Hadrian\'s time, victims offered to Zeus at Salamis were \nI anointed with sacred ointments thus becoming "Anointed Ones" or \n"Christs" then hung up and stabbed through the side with a \nspear. 40 Nothing in Jesus\'s myth occurred at random; every detail was \npart of a formal sacrificial tradition, even to the "procession of palms" \nwhich glorified sacred kings in ancient Babylon. 41 \n\nFar-Eastern traditions were utilized too. The Roman empire was \nwell aware of the teachings and myths of Buddhism. Buddha images \nin classic Greek style were made in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the first \ncentury a.d. 42 Buddhist ideas like the "footprints of Buddha" ap- \npeared among Christians. Bishop Sulpicius of Jerusalem reported that, \nas in India, "In the dust where Christ trod the marks of His step can \n| still be seen, and the earth still bears the print of His feet." 43 Buddhist \nmetaphors and phrasing also appeared in the Gospels. Jesus\'s formu- \nla, "Dearly Beloved," was the conventional way for Tantric deities to \naddress their teachings to Devi, their Goddess. 44 \n\nScholars\' efforts to eliminate paganism from the Gospels in order \nto find a historical Jesus have proved as hopeless as searching for a \ncore in an onion. 45 Like a mirage, the Jesus figure looks clear at a \ndistance but lacks approachable solidity. "His" sayings and parables \ncame from elsewhere; "his" miracles were old twice-told tales. Even the \nLord\'s Prayer was a collection of sayings from the Talmud, many \nderived from earlier Egyptian prayers to Osiris. 46 The Sermon on the \nMount, sometimes said to contain the essence of Christianity, had no \noriginal material; it was made up of fragments from Psalms, Ecclesiastes, \nIsaiah, Secrets of Enoch, and the Shemone Esreh. 47 Moreover, it was \nunknown to the author of the oldest Gospel, pseudo-Mark. 48 \n\nThe discovery that the Gospels were forged, centuries later than \nthe events they described, is still not widely known even though the \nCatholic Encyclopedia admits, "The idea of a complete and clear-cut \ncanon of the New Testament existing from the beginning . . . has no \nfoundation in history." No extant manuscript can be dated earlier than \nthe 4th century a.d.; most were written even later. 49 The oldest \nmanuscripts contradict one another, as also do even the present canon \nof synoptic Gospels. \n\nThe church owed its canon to the Gnostic teacher Marcion, who \nfirst collected Pauline epistles about the middle of the 2nd century. \n\n\n\n469 \n\n\n\nJesus Christ \n\n\n\nPorphyry (ca. 234- \n305 a.d.) Neoplatonist \nphilosopher, scholar, \nand writer; biographer \nof Plotinus;an \nopponent of the \nChristian church, \nwhich eventually \ndestroyed most of his \nbooks. \n\nSynoptic Gospels \n\nThe first three books of \nthe New Testament \n(Matthew, Mark, \nLuke), which differ \nradically from the \nmaterial in the so- \ncalled "Gnostic" \nGospel of John. \n\nJulius Wellhausen \n\n(1844-1918) German \nOld Testament \nscholar, a leader of the \n"higher criticism" \nmovement. \n\n\n\nLater he was excommunicated as a heretic because he denied that the \nscriptures were mystical allegories full of magic words of power. The \nepistles he collected were already over a century old, if indeed they were \nwritten by Paul; much of their material was made up of forged \ninterpolations. 50 \n\nThe most "historical" figure in the Gospels was Pontius Pilate, to \nwhom Jesus was presented as "king" of the Jews and simultaneously \nas a criminal deserving the death penalty for "blasphemy" because he \ncalled himself Christ, Son of the Blessed (Luke 23:3; Mark 14:61- \n64). This alleged crime was no real crime. Eastern provinces swarmed \nwith self-styled Christs and Messiahs, calling themselves Sons of God \nand announcing the end of the world. None of them was executed for \n"blasphemy." 51 The beginning of the story probably lay in the \ntradition of sacred-king sacrifice in Jerusalem long before Pilate\'s admin- \nistration, when Rome was trying to discourage such barbarisms. \n\nFrom 103 to 76 B.C., Jerusalem was governed by Alexander \nJanneaus, called the Aeon, who defended his throne by fighting \nchallengers. One year, on the Day of Atonement, his people attacked \nhim at the altar, waving palm branches to signify that he should die \nfor the earth\'s fertility. Alexander declined the honor and instituted a \npersecution of his own subjects. Another king of Jerusalem took the \nname of Menelaus, "Moon-king," and practiced the rite of sacred \nmarriage in the temple. 52 Herod also made a sacred marriage, and \nhad John the Baptist slain as a surrogate for himself. \n\nIf there was a Jesus cult in Jerusalem after 30 a.d., it completely \ndisappeared forty years later when Titus conquered the city and \noutlawed many local customs, including human sacrifice. Jerusalem was \nwholly Romanized under Hadrian. It was newly named Aelia Capito- \nlina and rededicated to the Goddess. The temple became a shrine of \nVenus. 53 Tacitus described the siege of Jerusalem, but his writing is \nabruptly cut off at the moment when Roman forces entered the city as \nif the final chapters were deliberately destroyed so no one knows \nwhat the Romans found there. However, Romans did express disap- \nproval of the Jews\' or Christians\' cannibalistic sacraments. Porphyry \ncalled it "absurd beyond all absurdity, and bestial beyond every sort of \nbestiality, that a man should taste human flesh and drink the blood of \nmen of his own genus and species, and by doing should have eternal \nlife." 54 \n\nFrom the Christians\' viewpoint, a real historical Jesus was essential \nto the basic premise of the faith: the possibility of immortality through \nidentification with his own death and resurrection. Wellhausen rightly \nsaid Jesus would have no place in history unless he died and returned \nexactly as the Gospels said. 55 "If Christ hath not been raised, your faith \nis vain" (1 Corinthians 15:17). Still, despite centuries of research, no \nhistorical Jesus has come to light. It seems his story was not merely \noverlaid with myth; it was mythic to the core. \n\nLike all myths, it revealed much about the collective psychology \nthat created it. In earlier pagan religions, the Mother and Son \n\n\n\n470 \n\n\n\nperiodically ousted the Father from his heavenly throne. The divine son Jesus Christ \n\nbf Christianity no longer challenged the heavenly king, but tamely \n\nsubmitted to his fatal command: "Not my will, but thine, be done" ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n([Luke 22:42). Some early sects said the Father who demanded his \nkon\'s blood was cruel, even demonic. 56 These were suppressed, but \nScholars have discerned in Christianity "an original attitude of hostil- \nity toward the father figure, which was changed in the first two Christian \npenturies into an attitude of passive masochistic docility." 57 \n\nIf orthodox Christianity demanded subordination of the Son, it was \nfeven more determined to subordinate the Mother. The Gospels\' \njlesus showed little respect for his mother, which troubled the church in \nIts Renaissance efforts to attract women to the cult of Mary. "Any \nhero who speaks to his mother only twice, and on both occasions \nAddresses her as \'Woman,\' is a difficult figure for the sentimental \nbiographers." 58 Together with Jesus\'s avowed opposition to marriage \nind the family (Matthew 22:30; Luke 14:26), women\'s primary \nconcerns, New Testament sexism tended to disgust educated women of \n[he pagan world. \n\nBut the Jesus who emulated Buddha in advocating poverty and \nhumility eventually became the mythic figurehead for one of the \nworld\'s pre-eminent money-making organizations. The cynical Pope \nLeo X exclaimed, "What profit has not that fable of Christ brought \nIs!" 59 \n\nModern theologians tend to sidestep the question of whether Jesus \n(vas in fact a fable or a real person. In view of the complete dearth of \nhard evidence, and the dubious nature of the soft evidence, it seems \nChristianity is based on the ubiquitous social phenomena of credulity: \n\nAn idea is able to gain and retain the aura of essentia] truth through telling \nand retelling. This process endows a cherished notion with more \nveracity than a library of facts. . . . [DJocumentation plays only a small role \nin contrast to the act of re-confirmation by each generation of scholars. \nIn addition, the further removed one gets from the period in question, the \ngreater is the strength of the conviction. Initial incredulousness is soon \nconverted into belief in a probability and eventually smug assurance. 60 \n\nI. H. Smith, 19V 2. Albright, 262. 3. Fra/er, G.B., 341. 4. Graves, G.M. 1, 89. \n\n5.

Apart from its purely sexual meaning, there were many \ncorollary ideas, such as: (1) the spark of life, or fetus (bindu) \nconceived within the Mother of Creation; (2) the dead body enclosed in \nthe womb of Mother Earth; (3) the eternal orgasm of Shiva the jewel \nand Kali the lotus in their cosmic sexual dance; (4) the sleeping god, \nbetween reincarnations, cradled in the Lotus of his Mother. Another \nword for the male "jewel" was vajra, meaning phallus, gem, spark of \nlife, and bolt of lightning. 1 \n\nl.Rawson, E.A.,151. \n\n\n\nJews, Persecution of \n\nIllogically, Christians justified persecutions of Jews by calling them \n"Christ-killers," though their own theology said God had decreed \nChrist\'s death; therefore the Jews only obeyed the will of God. \nGospel passages interpolated after the church\'s rise to power in Rome \nabsolved Pilate of guilt because he represented the Holy City. The \nJews were condemned by the ancient liturgical phrase copied into the \nGospel, which used to invoke the fertilizing power of a god\'s blood \nbut was later interpreted as an acceptance of blood guilt: "His blood be \non us, and on our children" (Matthew 27:23-25). \n\nThis pious forgery became the foundation for centuries of persecu- \ntions, culminating even in the present century with the extermination \nof millions of Jews under the Nazi regime, the latest in a two-thousand- \nyear history of pogroms. \n\nUp to the middle of the 14th century the free city of Cologne \nremained a haven for Jewish merchants, weavers\' guilds, and other \ncommercial enterprises, resisting domination by the church. Then \nCatholic forces moved in; Jewish merchants were burned alive in \ntheir houses with their wives and children; those who escaped the \nimmolation were banished. Their property remained in Christian \nhands, with 50 percent going to the victorious archbishop. 1 \n\nThe great plagues of the 14th century were usually attributed to \nthe Jews, said to cause the pestilence by poisoning wells and streams \nwith a combination of holy wafers stolen from the churches and the \nmenstrual blood of Jewish women. Each wave of plague brought a \nwave of massacre of Jewish communities. In 1382, rioters looted and \nvandalized the Jewish quarter in Paris. 2 In 1 391 , the Archdeacon of \nSeville instigated a "Holy War against the Jews." Mobs stormed the \nghetto, tore down synagogues, and murdered an estimated 41,000 \npersons. 5 Twelve thousand Jews perished in Bavaria at the time of the ] \nBlack Death; two thousand were burned at Strasbourg for causing the \' \n\n\n\n472 \n\n\n\nplague of 1 348; at Chinon an immense trench was dug and filled with Jews, Persecution of \n\nblazing wood to burn 160 Jews in a single day. 4 \n\nThe church encouraged persecution of Jews to divert attention ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nfrom the developing idea that these terrible plagues, which killed \nabout half of Europe\'s population before the end of the century, were \ncaused by a malicious God. The pope himself referred in a bull to \n"the pestilence with which God is afflicting the Christian people." The \nhorrors of the plague revived Gnostic opinions of the evil Jehovah. \nOne professor wrote: "The hostility of God is stronger than the hostility \nof man." 5 \n\nThe real cause of the plagues was the Christian commerce with \nthe Holy Land. Crusaders\' ships carried millions of Oriental black \nrats, with their fleas, the true carriers of the plague bacillus. 6 Being \nignorant of this, Christian authorities made no effort to control the \nrats but tried to exterminate Jews instead. Jew-killing probably served to \nIvent some of the popular resentment of clergymen, who behaved \npadly during the plagues. Most deserted their flocks in haste to leave \nplague-stricken areas. Churchmen generally were accused of "panic \nfear and neglect." 7 \n\nPersecutions were supported by many made-to-order myths. In \n[Spain, the popular myth of the ritual murder was combined with the \njmyth of plague-magic to give Torquemada his excuse to expel the Jews \nfrom the country in 1490 and take their property for the enrichment \npf the church. Some Jews were arrested and tortured until they \nconfessed having stolen a consecrated host and kidnapped a four- \nvear-old boy called Santo Nino (Holy Child) from the doorway of a \nchurch. They gave the child five thousand lashes, crowned him with \nthorns, and extracted his heart to make anti-Christian magic. All Jewry \nwas involved in this plot to destroy Christendom by black magic, the \nconfessions said. Jews planned to kidnap Christian children and use \nmeir hearts or blood or ashes to make charms which, thrown into \nrivers and wells, would make all Christians sick. \n\nIt was said Santo Nino bore his sufferings with great serenity, and \npen directed the Jews in the removal of his heart. The child\'s blind \npother miraculously recovered her sight at the moment of his death (an \nInterpolated allegory of Judaism receiving enlightenment by the \nHeath of Christ, perhaps). The Holy Child went directly to heaven, \nwhich accounted for the authorities\' inability to find his remains \nwhere the Jews said they were buried. 8 \n\nThis mythic porridge started the expulsion of thousands of Jews \nfrom Spain and Christian seizure of their assets. In 1260 the Jewish \npopulation of Toledo had built "the largest and most beautiful syna- \ngogue in Spain." In the 1 5th century the Jews of Toledo were \nmassacred and the synagogue appropriated by the church. It now bears \nIhe name of the Church of Santa Maria la Blanca. 9 According to \nContemporary theologians, persecution and seizure of property was a \nlegitimate activity of Catholic powers. In their view, "no illegitimate \n\n\n\n473 \n\n\n\nJews, Persecution of violence was being done to the Jews, infidels, and heretics put to the \nsword at the behest of the Church: these people had no rights to be \n^ mmmmmamm ^^^^ violated. " \' \n\nThe legend of Santo Nino was not even an original invention of \nthe Spanish Inquisition. The same legend had been used two \ncenturies earlier to stimulate a persecution of Jews in the Rhineland. \nThe German child-martyr\'s name was Werner. He was kidnapped, \ntortured, and sacrificed to the Jewish God. His mutilated body was \nfound in a river, and a church was built over his tomb at Bacharach. 1 \' \nIn 1322, eighteen Swabian Jews were slain at Ehingen for stealing a \nconsecrated host from a church. Later it was discovered that the Jews \nwere innocent, and the real culprit was a Christian woman who was \nsubsequently burned for witchcraft. 12 \n\nJews and women were almost equally serviceable as scapegoats for \nthe evils of medieval life; but women were more detested than Jews, \naccording to a decree of Orvieto in 1 350. This law said if a man and \nwoman became involved in a love affair, one of them Christian and \nthe other Jewish, the woman in the case, of whichever faith, must be \nbeheaded or burned alive. 13 \n\nOften, anti-Semitism went to such lengths that Christian authori- \nties even denied the origin of their own religion from a Jewish matrix. \nOpposing a papal aspirant of Jewish ancestry, St. Bernard wrote: "It \nwould be an insult to Christ if the offspring of a Jew occupied the \nthrone of Peter." H Bernard seems to have wholly forgotten his own \nchurch\'s teaching that Peter himself was a Jew, as were all the other \napostles and Jesus as well. The Jews didn\'t press the point, since the \nformer Jewishness of Christ or Peter made no difference in the \npolitical situation. \n\nAnti-Semitism reached an apogee under the rule of Adolf Hitler in \nour own century. Hitler made the Jews wear yellow badges, like \nmedieval heretics. A German Christian organization announced in \n1937, "Hitler\'s word is God\'s law." 15 Hitler said: \n\nMy feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It \npoints me to the man who once, in loneliness, surrounded by only a \nfew followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned \nmen to fight against them and who, God\'s truth! was greatest not as a \nsufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love, as a Christian and as a man, I \nread through the passage which tells us how the Lord rose at last in His \nmight and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of \nvipers and adders. How terrific was the fight for the world against the \nJewish poison. \' 6 \n\nEvidently Hitler was not much of a reader. He never got to the \npart that designated Jesus the Bridegroom of Zion; nor did he seem to \nknow who owned the Temple. \n\nI. Agrippa, 19. 2. Tuchman, 380. 3. Coulton, 288. 4. White 2, 73. \n5.

In \n43 1, aged only 19, she was burned as a witch at Rouen, wearing a \nlacard that said: "Relapsed, Heretic, Apostate, Idolator." 4 Ecclesiasti- \nal authorities never did explain the nature of her "idols." The \nxecutioner pretended to find her heart unburned in the ashes, to sell it \np a holy relic. 5 \n\nFor 500 years Joan remained a popular national heroine until she \n[as finally canonized by Pope Benedict XV in 1920. To the church \nif her own time this would have been unthinkable. "The Church, \n[alous of her pagan authority over pagan soldiers; and jealous, too, of \ner success-based popularity with the masses; needed no urging by the \nInglish to see Joan as \'dispensable.\' It was the Church which tried \n[nd condemned her; the Church which regarded her rightly, of \npurse as an enemy; and the Church was glad to get rid of her." 6 \npnically, the same church that pronounced Joan a witch and had her \n|lled, now claims her as a saint. \n\n1.

Even the church accepted Joan\'s \nipntificate as historical fact, up to the beginning of the 17th century. \nler portrait appeared in a row of papal busts in Siena Cathedral, labeled \nlAannes VIII, femina ex Anglia: John VIII, an Englishwoman. 1 \n\nPope Joan was first mentioned by her contemporary, Anastasius \nje Librarian (d. 886). Scotus\'s chronicle of the popes listed her: \nluD. 854, Lotharii 14, Joanna, a woman, succeeded Leo, and reigned \nwo years, five months, and four days." De Gemblours\'s chronicle \n\n\n\n475 \n\n\n\nJoan, Pope said, "It is reported that this John was a female, and that she conceived \n\nby one of her servants. The Pope, becoming pregnant, gave birth to a \n^^^^^^^^^^_ child, wherefor some do not number her among the Pontiffs." Thomas \nde Elmham\'s official list of the popes said: "a.d. 855, Joannes. This \none doesn\'t count; she was a woman." 2 \n\nPapal historian and Vatican librarian Platina wrote in The Lives of \nthe Popes that Joan was English, that she knew more of the scriptures \nthan any man, and that she was elected pope by disguising herself in \nmen\'s clothes and making herself a "monk" noted for scholarship. \nHer deception was revealed when her labor pains came on her, and she \ndied in a street between the Lateran and St. Clement\'s church. 3 She \nwas dragged into the street and stoned to death and buried there in an \nunmarked grave. 4 Martin Polonus said the street was ever afterward \navoided by papal processions, "out of detestation for what happened \nthere. Nor on that account is she placed in the catalogue of Holy \nPontiffs, not only on account of her sex, but also because of the \nhorribleness of the circumstances." 5 \n\nJoan (or John) was the only pope ever stricken from papal records, \nalthough her pontificate was better documented than many others, \nespecially the popes before the 4th or 5 th centuries, many of whom had \nno contemporary documentation at all but were mere names inserted \ninto later chronicles to create an illusion of unbroken succession. \n\nThe official story now is that there was an "antipope" named John, \nenthroned by popular demand against the will of the clergy, and soon \noverthrown. 6 But church historians were seldom trustworthy. In 1 886, \nEmmanuel Royidis published Joan\'s biography, Papissa Joanna, stat- \ning in his introduction: "Every sentence in my book and almost every \nphrase is based on the testimony of contemporary authors." The \nchurch immediately banned his book and excommunicated him. 7 \n\nPope Joan may not have been so apocryphal as she is now \nportrayed. Part of the church\'s most carefully hidden history shows \nthat there were women in high ecclesiastical positions up to the 12th \ncentury, when they began to be deposed. Abbesses in Germany and \nFrance once held episcopal powers and the title of Sacerdos Maxima: \nHigh Priestess. At Quedlinburg, the scene of particularly intense \nwitch persecutions, the abbesses once controlled all religious orders and \nthe whole town, having titles of Superior Canoness of the Cathedral, \nMetropolitana (Mayor), and Matriarch. 8 \n\nIn Milan during early Renaissance times, dual cathedrals of the \nmonks of St. John and the canonesses of St. Maria Maggiore seem to \nhave been devoted to worship of the female principle after the manner j \nof the Order of Fontevrault, whose monks "took vows of obedience \nto the abbess in imitation of the obedience of Jesus to his mother." The \nMilanese nuns bore the title of Sancta Dei Genetrix Holy Mother \nof God. 9 \n\nFrom Milan came a sect devoted to an unofficial papess named \nGuglielma, whose followers "believed she was incarnation of the \n\n\n\n476 \n\n\n\nj Holy Spirit." Her Second Coming was predicted, and she was reincar- Joan, Pope \n\nl nated in a lady named Manfreda or Maifreda, whose votaries said \n\n"the male dominated Papacy would pass away, yielding to a line of ^^^^^^^^_^_ \n\nfemale Popes. In preparation for this event they elected Sister \n| Manfreda the first of the Popesses, and several wealthy families of \nLombardy provided at great cost the sacred vessels they expected her \nto use when she said Mass in Rome at the Church of Santa Maria \nMaggiore." But the sect was exterminated by the Inquisition, and \nManfreda was burned at the stake in the year 1300. 10 Some die-hards \nI claimed she was later reincarnated as the Fairy Queen. 11 \n\nThere were other women in history close to the papal office who \nI may have contributed to the legends of the Papess. Gibbon suggested \nI the period in the 1 Oth century when Rome was ruled by two women of \nthe house of Theophylact, Theodora and her daughter Marozia, both \nqueens and sacred harlots, bearing the title oisenatrix. "The most \nstrenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and \ntheir reign may have suggested to darker ages the fable of a female pope. \nThe bastard son, the grandson, and the great grandson of Marozia \na rare genealogy were seated on the Chair of St. Peter." \n\nLiudprand, bishop of Cremona, said it differently: "A certain \n|shameless strumpet called Theodora at one time was sole monarch of \nRome and shame though it is to write it exercised power like a man. \nShe had two daughters, Marozia and Theodora, who were not only \nher equals but could surpass her in the exercises that Venus loves." \nTheodora\'s lover, Bishop John of Ravenna, was given the papacy: \n"Theodora, like a harlot fearing that she would have few opportunities \nlof bedding with her sweetheart, forced him to abandon his bishopric \nend take for himself O, monstrous crime! the Papacy of Rome." 12 \nflorin didn\'t seem to need forcing. He became Pope John X in 914, \nput Marozia deposed him in 928 and threw him into a dungeon in the \nIcastle of Sant\' Angelo, where he died. Three years later she gave the \npapal throne to the son she had borne to Pope Sergius. 13 \n\nFrom time to time, other women exerted significant influence on \nthe papacy. Pope John XXII had so many mistresses that it was said \npe turned the Lateran palace into a brothel. He made his favorite one of \nthe most powerful feudal baronesses in Italy, "for he was so blindly in \n; love with her that he made her governor of cities and even gave to her \nthe golden crosses and cups of St. Peter himself." When Pope \n[Klexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) left Rome to visit his son Cesare, he left \n| pis daughter Lucretia Borgia in charge. Another woman who com- \njfnanded popes was Catherine Benincasa of Siena, who convinced Pope \nCregory XI that she had a mandate from God to order his papacy \nmoved from Avignon back to Rome. 14 \n\nBut the real papess, if there was one, belonged to an earlier era \nhan these an era of untrustworthy, disconnected records, often \nDestroyed by social upheavals and wars. A popular fairy tale, "The \n[Flounder in the Sea," began as a hostile allegory of the papess. A \n\n\n\n477 \n\n\n\nJocasta \nJonah \n\n\n\nmagic flounder granted the wishes of the ambitious wife of a fisherman; \nfirst she wished to become wealthy, then noble; she wanted to be a \nking, then a pope. Finally she wanted to become God, and hubris \ncaused her downfall. The fisherman in the story was naturally St. \nPeter, bridegroom of the church (Lady Ecclesia); the miraculous fish \nwith the power to create popes but not God represented Christ. 15 \nThe moral of the story was the common anti-feminist opinion that \nwomen were more easily corrupted by political power than men. \n\nSeventeenth-century England freely circulated the original story of \nPope Joan to cast opprobrium on the "papists." A London pamphlet \nshowed her in papal robes and tiara, her child appearing from beneath \nher skirt, with the verse: \n\nA Woman Pope (as History doth tell) \n\nIn High Procession, She in Labour fell, \n\nAnd was Delivered of a Bastard Son; \n\nThence, Rome some call the Whore of Babylon. \' 6 \n\nThe Papess of the Tarot cards was often called Pope Joan. \nWhen the first Tarot decks were being produced, Joan\'s pontificate was \nuniversally accepted as historical fact. The card-Papess\'s three-tiered \ntiara was the same as the headdress shown on engravings of Pope \nJoan. 17 However, less than a century later, French card painters were \nafraid to set a woman on the papal throne even symbolically. They \n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanged the Papess to Juno in a classic chlamys. A Belgian Tarot \neven transformed her into a man, labeled "the Spaniard." 18 \n\nWhether Pope Joan really existed or not, a curious Vatican custom \narose in the wake of her legend.

St. Josaphat enjoyed great \npopularity in the Middle Ages, an ironical development in a Europe \nthat abhorred Buddhism as a work of the devil. \n\nl.Attwater, 58. \n\n\n\n;eph \n\nie Gospel of Mark, oldest of the synoptic Gospels, never men- \n\n>ned Joseph. Jesus is "the son of Mary" (Mark 6:3), and of Mary only. \n\nThe Gospel of Matthew gives a long genealogy of paternal \nicestors to prove Jesus a descendant of David through his father \n| Joseph. Then, the verses immediately following make nonsense of the \nwhole genealogy by declaring that Jesus was not Joseph\'s son at all. \nAn early translation of the New Testament however, the Codex \nSinaiticus, stated: "Joseph begat Jesus." \' \n\nThe Gospel of Luke calls Joseph a son of Heli, i.e., of Helios, the \nsun (Luke 3:23). Jesus called Eli, or Elias, his "father" who forsook \nhim when he was crucified (Matthew 27:46; Mark 1 5:34). Jesus was \nlater identified with the same "father." A sect of Gaulish Christians \nworshipped Christ as Helios, calling themselves Heliognosti. 2 The solar \neclipse at Jesus\'s death, his titles of Light of the World and Sun of \nRighteousness, were taken from cults of the solar hero, as were his \nvirgin birth and his mortal pseudo-father who didn\'t lie with his wife \nuntil she brought forth her Divine Child, son of the sun. ? \n\nThe Christian legend of Joseph\'s rod said he was chosen to be \nMary\'s husband, out of a group of suitors, by a symbolic test of \nfertility. All candidates laid their (phallic) rods on the (female-symbolic) \naltar. Joseph\'s rod alone burst into bloom, a proof of magical potency. \nThe sacred dove of Aphrodite came down from heaven and perched on \nJoseph\'s rod, signifying that the Goddess accepted him. 4 The same \ndove appeared later over the head of Jesus at his baptism, with the same \nI implication of acceptance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n479 \n\n\n\nJoseph \n\n\n\nProtoevangelium, \n\nalso known as the \nRevelation of James: \na Gospel written in the \nsecond century A.D., \nvalued by early church \nfathers as authentic \nbut eventually \neliminated from the \n\n\n\nThe story of the flowering rod (virility) was common in Middle- \nEastern mythologies; rods were also interchangeable with serpents, \nbecause of the phallic significance of both (Exodus 7:12). The flowering \nrod was also a magic talisman for Tannhauser, who proved the \nvalidity of his pagan faith against the pope with a rod that burst into \nbloom. This rod came from the mountain sanctuary of the Goddess \nVenus and represented Tannhauser as her lover. 5 \n\nThe Goddess was incarnate in a queen in Tannhauser\'s case, \n"Queen Sybil"; in the parallel case of Thomas Rhymer, the Fairy \nQueen; in the case of the biblical Joseph, Mariamne, Queen of \nJerusalem, embodiment of the Goddess Mari. There was a Joseph \nwho espoused temple maidens at Herod\'s court, but was slain after he \nlay with the queen, Mariamne, or Miriam, or Mary. 6 \n\nThe priestly name of Joseph may have been bestowed on Jewish \ncounterparts of the priests known in Egypt as "fathers of the god." 7 \nThe function of such holy men was to beget, on the temple maidens, \nchildren who would be sacer: firstborn "sons of God" dedicated to \nthe service of the deity. The Protoevangelium says the virgin Mary was \nsuch a temple maiden; she also bore the name of the Queen and the \nGoddess, as well as the holy harlot who was high priestess of the sacred \ndrama. 8 The mythic proliferation of Marys and Josephs indicates that \nthese were not personal names but characters in the drama: the chosen \nhusband who was yet not a husband; the father-of-God who was yet \nnot a father; the virgin-mother-Goddess-priestess-queen who was also a \nkadesha or "Bride of God." 9 \n\nIt can be shown that Joseph was indeed a divine name in Israel. \nThe Egyptian form was Djoser or Tcheser, a deified pharaoh long \nassociated in both Egyptian and Hebrew tradition with the seven-year \nfamine along the Nile. 10 Palestine had a town dedicated to Joseph-El, \nor "Joseph the God," possibly the same Egyptian god-king. 11 Certainly \nthe Old Testament Joseph was "chosen" by the Goddess who \ninspired divinatory interpretation of dreams, called Nanshe by the \nBabylonians. 12 Dream interpretation was the specialty of the Old \nTestament Joseph in his role of Egyptian wizard-priest associated, like \nDjoser, with the seven-year famine. A multicolored vestment was the \nmark of oneiromantic wizard-priests in Babylon, which probably ex- \nplains Joseph\'s celebrated coat of many colors (Genesis 37:23). \n\nJoseph\'s sojourn in the Pit would naturally have taken place \nbefore, not after, he was awarded the coat. His "brothers" (fellow \npriests?) lowered him into the abaton for a death-and-rebirth ritual, such \nas Assyrian and Babylonian priests underwent before they emerged \nfrom the Pit reborn into a holy life. 13 After such an initiation, Joseph \nwas inspired not only to interpret dreams; he also practiced divination | \nwith the aid of a silver cup (Genesis 44:5), the vessel of the Goddess, \nmade of moon-metal. (See Abaddon.) \n\nAnother biblical Joseph associated with the Christian sacred drama, \nand a divine cup, was Joseph of Arimathea, literally "a Joseph \n\n\n\n480 \n\n\n\nbelonging to the Goddess-mother Ari," or Mari, she who made men Jove \n\n(arya) out of clay. 14 This Joseph was a "counselor" of Jerusalem, that Judas \n\nis, a priest; he supervised Jesus\'s burial. Later myths said the same ^ ^^^^_.^__ \n\nJoseph carried to England the divine sexual symbols of a (male) \nflowering rod and a (female) cup or Grail of sacred blood. Several \nwomen named Mary accompanied him. The holy articles were \nenshrined at Glastonbury, formerly named Caer Wydyr, an omphalic \nseat of the union between pagan God and Goddess. 15 Rod and cup \nwere reinterpreted in a Christian context by the legends of the Holy \nGrail at Glastonbury. However, mystical systems such as the Tarot \nsuits of rods and cups suggest that these were none other than male- \nfemale elemental symbols given a Christian gloss (see Grail, Holy). \n\n1. H.

Juno the \nMother and Minerva the wise Crone remained; but Juventas the Virgin \ngave way to a young god, just as Hebe the virgin form of the Greek \nTriple Goddess gave way to the youth Ganymede. See Trinity. \n\n\n\nJudas \n\nAs the Christian figure of the Betrayer, Judas was poorly understood. \nFormerly, Judas was an ancestral god, father of the nation of Judah and \nof Jews (Judaei). As Jude, or Jeud, he was the "only-begotten son" of \nthe Divine Father Isra-El. 1 Judas was a dynastic name for priest-kings of \nJudea for a hundred years after Judas Maccabeus restored ancient \nsacrificial customs to the temple of Jerusalem in 165 B.C. 2 Thus the \nkingly name of Judas was commonly given victims sacrificed as \nsurrogates for a reigning monarch. \n\nJudas\'s legend parallels those of many Other sacred kings. He was \nborn of a holy woman named Cyboread, a prophetess or priestess. He \nwas sent out to sea in a chest (cista), which washed up on the isle of \nScariot hence his name, Judas Iscariot. The queen of the island \nraised him, as the princess of Egypt raised Moses. When he came of \nage, Judas returned home to take service at Pilate\'s court. Like \nOedipus, he killed his father and married his mother. Early Christians \nsaid Judas joined the disciples of Jesus in order to be cleansed of this \nsin. 3 \n\nThe Syrian Acts of Thomas declares however that Judas was \n\n\n\n\n\n\n481 \n\n\n\nJudas Jesus\'s twin brother, whose full name was Judas Thomas, i.e., "Judas \n\nthe Tammuz." Passages of the Koran insist that Judas had the same face \nm ^ m t^^^^mi^mm as J esus an< ^ v/as crucified in his stead. 4 Judas\'s qualifications as a \n\nsacrificial Savior hint that he might have combined with Jesus at some \npoint in early Christianity as an alternate seasonal god, like Horus and \nSet in Egypt. \n\nThe Gospels are vague and contradictory about Judas\'s death. \nMatthew says he hanged himself (27:5). Acts 1:18 says he died of a \nfall, which made him "burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels \ngushed out." Hanging and disemboweling were both common forms \nof ritual killing; but the ritualistic nature of Judas\'s death is most strongly \nsuggested by its location: Aceldama, the Field of Blood, dedicated to \n"the Potter in the House of the Lord," who received Judas\'s blood- \nmoney. \n\nThe Gospel writer naively admitted that the detail about the \nmoney that bought Jesus was inserted only to fulfill a "prophecy" in \nZechariah 11: "So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. And \n\nthe Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter And I took the \n\nthirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the \nLord." The Potter in the temple was an image of the Great Goddess \nArum, "The Potter," a title of Ishtar or Astarte or Ninhursag who made \nmankind of clay moistened with blood. The Potter\'s Field was clay, \nperiodically soaked with blood to restore to the Goddess some of the \nlife-essence she bestowed. 5 \n\nGospel stories contradict each other concerning this field. One \nwriter said Judas purchased the field with his thirty pieces of silver \n(Acts 1:18). Another said he "repented" and took the money back to \nthe temple, where he flung it down, and the priests used it to buy \n"the potter\'s field, to bury strangers in" (Matthew 27:7). \n\nThe story of Judas\'s "betrayal" of Jesus is particularly confusing; \nwhy would anyone need to point Jesus out, when he had already \nentered the city as the central figure in a triumphal procession, playing \nthe part of the Bridegroom of Zion, calling himself the son of God, \npublicly conversing with angels, and publicly promising all men a share \nin his imminent resurrection (John 12: 15, 29, 32)? In fact the \nmonetary payment and the "betrayal" seem to have been necessary \nparts of the traditional drama, devices to absolve the executioners of \nguilt. \n\nIt might be supposed that when Jesus received Judas\'s kiss, he \nbecame a sacred king of the Judaei. He was "betrayed" by the spirit \nof the eleventh hour, who in the solar cults announced the coming \ndeath of the Light of the World in the twelfth hour which is why \nthe eleventh hour still presages something dire. Because of the kiss, it \nwas sometimes assumed that Judas was "the disciple whom Jesus \nloved" though Gospels later removed from the canon said Jesus loved \nMary Magdalene more than any of his male followers. 6 The much- \ndiscussed passage in John 2 1 was a remnant of sun worship, with which \nthe Gospel of John was generally permeated: \n\n\n\n482 \n\n\n\nPeter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; Juggernaut \n\nwhich also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he \n\nthat betrayeth thee? Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthis man do? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what \n\nis that to thee? \n\nTwelve disciples signified the twelve hours of the day: "Are \nthere not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he \nstumbleth not, because he seeth the light of the world" (John 1 1:9). \nThe disciple of the last hour, who leaned on the breast of the sun at his \nsetting, was the evening star, often called Shalem or Shalom, \n"peace," because he betrayed the solar deity into his nightly death and \nspoke the Word of Farewell to him: salaam, Peace. The Jews\' solar \nking died at Jerusalem, "the House of Peace." \n\nThe ancients knew the evening star and morning star were one \nand the same, the planet Venus. So the same "disciple" who \nbetrayed the sun god into the land of death was also the one who tarried \nuntil he rose again in the morning, the last star whose light still shone \nas the sun was ascending to heaven. Thus the betrayer was the spirit \nclosest to the deity; the hour that "loved" him. Hellenization of Israel \nconverted the dual morning-star and evening-star god into the Dioscuri \nor heavenly twins. Mithraic icons showed them turning the torch of \nlife downward on one side of the sun, upward on the other. 7 \n\nThere was another interpretation of the mysterious passage em- \nbedded in the famous legend of the Wandering Jew. Ignoring the \ntwo accounts of Judas\'s death, medieval interpreters said Jesus meant \nthat Judas, for his crime, was condemned never to die until Jesus \n"came again" at the end of the world. So Judas wandered through time, \nweary but deathless, living many lifetimes in bitterness and regret. \nPerhaps this tale of Wandering Jew was intended to mock the pagans\' \nidea of many reincarnations on earth. \n\nYet another Christianization of Judas transformed him into St. \nJude, adopted into the Christian canon because the ancient cult of \nJudas continued in Judea and couldn\'t be eradicated. The fictitious St. \nJude became very popular in the Middle Ages. True to his Judaic \ncharacter, the saint was called "a powerful intercessor for those in \ndesperate straits." 8 \n\n1.

Returning home \nfrom a late journey, he found two people in his bed and killed them \nboth, assuming he had caught his wife with her lover. Instead, the \nmurdered pair proved to be Julian\'s own father and mother. 2 As \npenance for his error, Julian took his wife and went to live by a ford, \nwhere they gave shelter and assistance to travelers. The legend seems \nto have been concocted from nothing more substantial than a votive \nfigure of the emperor Julian at a roadside shrine, where travelers left \nofferings so as to have good fortune on the road. Many of the gods thus \nhonored by pagan pilgrims were arbitrarily declared saints in order to \nprovide a Christian motive for the worship given them. \n\nl.Attwater,206. 2. Hazlitt, 351. \n\n\n\nS^ Juno \n\n^^X Roman Great Mother, derived from Sabine-Etruscan Uni, the \n\nThree-in-One deity cognate with "yoni" and "Uni-verse." Juno had \ndozens of attributes or emanations which are sometimes erroneously \n\nviewed as separate Goddesses. Juno Fortuna was the Goddess of Fate. \n\nSign of Juno Juno Sospita was the Preserver. Juno Regina was Queen of Heaven. \n\nJuno Lucina was Goddess of Celestial Light. Juno Moneta was the \nAdvisor and Admonisher. Juno Martialis was the virgin mother of \nMars. Juno Caprotina, or Februa, was the Goddess of erotic love. Juno \nPopulonia was Mother of the People. And so on, through many \nother Junos. 1 \n\nEvery Roman woman embodied a bit of Goddess\'s spirit, her own \nsoul a juno, corresponding to the genius of a man. 2 Later patriarchal \nvocabularies dropped the word juno but retained genius, thus depriving \nwomen of their souls which may be why church councils of the \nearly Middle Ages sometimes maintained that women are soulless. \n\nJuno\'s sacred month of June honored her as patroness of marriages \nand the family, which is why June is still the traditional time for \nweddings. \n\n\n\n484 \n\n\n\nJuno had her formidable aspects too. As a battle-goddess she Jupiter \n\nrepresented the fighting spirit of a mother defending her offspring, Justice \n\nthe epitome of bravery by Roman definition. Therefore Juno Seispitei ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nMatri Reginae (Juno the Preserver, Queen of the Mothers) was \nregarded as the spirit of war. 3 Her title was the same as that of the Hindu \nwar-goddess Durga the Preserver, Leader of the Mothers. 4 Like all \nIndo-European forms of the Goddess, Juno was only another local \nmanifestation of the same all-encompassing deity. \n\nAmong Juno\'s sacred symbols were the peacock, the cowrie shell, \nand of course the lily, or lotus, universal yonic emblem. With her \nsacred lily, Juno conceived the god Mars without any assistance from \nher consort, Jupiter; thus she became the Blessed Virgin Juno. 5 The \nthree-lobed lily that used to represent her parthenogenetic power was \ninherited by the virgin Mary, who still retains it. \n\n\n\nJustice \n\nThe spirit of justice was female in classic paganism. Ulpian said \njustice depended on "the feminine nature principle, which has a \nprofounder kinship with the natura iustum (that which is just by \nnature) than does the male sex, with its greater susceptibility to the \nprinciple of domination." Pythagoreans taught that iusticia and aequi- \ntas (justice and equity) are "innate attributes of the feminine nature \nprinciple." \' \n\nThe Roman praetor or judge "gave expression to justice as the \norgan and viva vox of Bona Dea-Fauna-Fatua.

Like his counterparts in other nations, Jupiter \n\nwas primarily a rain god: hisjnn ctinn was to fertilize the soil wi th \n\nseminal moisture. Thus he was connected also with thunder and \n\nlightning his voice and his weapon. He was commonly known as \n\nJupiter Pluvius, "the Heavenly- Father- Who- Rains." \n\nJupiter was added to the originally female Capitoline Triad by \nousting the Virgin form of the Goddess, Juventas, leaving Juno and \nMinerva as Jupiter\'s two female partners. 1 Juno was said to be his wife, \nthough like Hera she was much older than her spouse. \n\n1.

Bachofen, 193. \n\n\n\nKa \n\nOne of an Egyptian\'s seven souls, often believed to be a spirit-twin \nresident in the afterbirth. 1 The Shilluks of the upper Nile, who in the \npresent century still worshipped the Cow-mother Hathor as bestower \nof the souls, buried afterbirths of their sacred kings in the same tombs \nwhere the kings themselves would be laid on the theory that a man \nneeded his ka in order to become a god after death. 2 In ancient Egypt, \nprayers were addressed to the ka of Osiris and other gods. India knew \nthe same concept, even the same word. Brahma had a soul-twin named \nKa, which was translated "Who?" 5 \n\nThe hieroglyphic sign of the ka was a pair of upraised arms with \nbent elbows. 4 This arm position evidently invoked the Goddess, and \nwas connected with the idea of the ka as a mother-given entity, each \nbaby\'s unformed twin, made of blood. 5 A Paleolithic painting from \nAlgeria shows a hunter stalking an ostrich while a full-hipped female \nfigure, larger than he, raises her arms in the position of the ka. The \nfemale figure was either a mother or a sexual partner, as shown by a \nserpentine connective line running from the hunter\'s crotch to hers. 6 \nEvidently, she made magic to help the hunter in his efforts, even \nthough she may have been far away. \n\nA vase figure from Amratian times showed a similar /ra-invocation \nperformed by a priestess, assisted by two men who helped hold her \narms aloft when she became tired. 7 The same magical /ra-invocation was \nperformed by Moses at the battle between Israelites and Amalekites. \nThe Israelites won because Moses, with the help of Aaron and Hur, \nheld up his arms in the Jte-position all day until the battle ended at \nsunset (Exodus 17:12). \n\nEgyptians thought the Jta-soul was immortal and dwelt in or near j \nthe tomb where the body rested. The same notion was common \namong Christians, who said a ghost lived in or near the grave. There is j \nin existence a letter written by an ancient Egyptian to his deceased \nwife, three years after her death. He attached the letter to the portrait \nstatue in her tomb, confident that her ka would read the letter. 8 \n\nAmong northern Aryans the idea of the ka was transposed into the \nDoppelganger (double-goer), a hidden twin-soul thought to reside in \n\n\n\n486 \n\n\n\nthe placenta or umbilical cord, though sometimes it could develop into a Kaaba \n\nfull-grown twin. Germanic folklore has many examples of the soul Kala-Nath \n\npreserved in a safer location than the body e.g., the giant who kept his ... \n\nsoul in an egg, and so on. German and French peasants used to treat \n\nan umbilical cord or afterbirth with great care, to give magical assistance \n\nto the child\'s future health or longevity. Sometimes, as in Greek \n\nmyth, mothers preserved their children\'s umbilical cords in a secret \n\nplace, thinking no harm could come to the child as long as the cord \n\nwas intact. 9 \n\n1. H.

Later Vedic priests diabolized Kalanemi as a "demon" \nwho begot Balarama and Krishna in the underworld before the \nbeginning of time. 1 \nl.O\'Flaherty.207. \n\n\n\nKalenderees \n\nWandering dervishes from medieval Hindustan who taught Tantric \ndoctrines in Persia and Arabia. 1 Their cult of the Goddess Kali may \nhave been the origin of the female-centered Sufi sect which revered \nthe same feminine Word of Creation (Om, Umm: the Matrix or \nMother-belly), and believed that religious fulfillment for men or \nwomen could be found only in sexual love. 2 See Kali Ma. \nl.Keightley,20. 2. Shah, 29, 175. \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n"Dark Mother," the Hindu Triple Goddess of creation, preservation, \nand destruction; now most commonly known in her Destroyer aspect, \nsquatting over her dead consort Shiva and devouring his entrails, \nwhile her yoni sexually devours his lingam (penis). Kali is "The hungry \nearth, which devours its own children and fattens on their corpses. . . . \nIt is in India that the experience of the Terrible Mother has been given \nits most grandiose form as Kali. But all this and it should not be \nforgotten is an image not only of the Feminine but particularly and \nspecifically of the Maternal. For in a profound way life and birth are \nalways bound up with death and destruction." \' \n\nKali was the basic archetypal image of the birth-and-death Mother, \nsimultaneously womb and tomb, giver of life and devourer of her \nchildren: the same image portrayed in a thousand ancient religions. \nEven modern psychologists face this image with uneasy acknowledg- \nment of its power. It seems the image of the angry, punishing, castrating \nFather is somehow less threatening than that of the destructive \nMother perhaps because she symbolized the inexorable reality of \ndeath, whereas he only postulated a problematic post-mortem \njudgment. 2 \n\n\n\n488 \n\n\n\nTantric worshippers of Kali thought it essential to face her Curse, \nthe terror of death, as willingly as they accepted Blessings from her \nbeautiful, nurturing, maternal aspect. For them, wisdom meant learning \nthat no coin has only one side: as death can\'t exist without life, so also \nlife can\'t exist without death. Kali\'s sages communed with her in the \ngrisly atmosphere of the cremation ground, to become familiar with \nimages of death. They said: "His Goddess, his loving Mother in time, \nwho gives him birth and loves him in the flesh, also destroys him in \nthe flesh. His image of Her is incomplete if he does not know Her as his \ntearer and devourer." 3 \n\nFew western scholars understood the profound philosophy behind \nthe hideous images of Kali the Destroyer. The London Museum \ndisplayed such an image with a label saying only, "Kali Destroying \nDemon." 4 The Encyclopaedia Britannica devoted five columns to \nChristian interpretations of the Logos without ever mentioning its \norigin in Kali\'s Om or Creative Word; Kali herself was dismissed in a \nbrief paragraph as the wife of Shiva and "a goddess of disease." 5 \nCertainly, as the Kalika or Crone she governed every form of death \nincluding disease; but she also ruled every form of life. \n\nKali stood for Existence, which meant Becoming because all her \nworld was an eternal living flux from which all things rose and \ndisappeared again, in endless cycles. The gods, whom she bore and \ndevoured, addressed her thus: \n\nThou art the Original of all the manifestations; Thou art the birthplace of \neven Us; Thou knowest the whole world, yet none know Thee. . . . \nThou art both Subtle and Gross, Manifested and Veiled, Formless, yet \nwith form. Who can understand Thee?. . . . It is Thou who art the \nSupreme Primordial Kalika. . . . Resuming after dissolution Thine own \nform, dark and formless, Thou alone remainest as One ineffable and \ninconceivable . . . though Thy self without beginning, multiform by the \npower of Maya, Thou art the Beginning of all, Creatrix, Protectress, \nand Destructress. 6 \n\nBrahmans assigned Kali\'s three functions to three male gods, \nlling them Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Kali\'s \narchaic consort Shiva the destroyer; but many scriptures opposed this \nmale trinity as offensively artificial. A prayer in the Tantrasara said: "O \nvlother! Cause and Mother of the World! Thou art the One \n\'rimordial Being, Mother of innumerable creatures, Creatrix of the \n\nry gods; even of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and \nShiva the Destroyer! O Mother, in hymning Thy praise I purify my \nh!" 7 The Nirvana Tantra treated the claims of male gods with \ncontempt: \n\nBrahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara [Shiva], and other gods are born of the body \nof that beginningless and eternal Kalika, and at the time of dissolution \nthey again disappear in Her. O Devi, for this reason, so long as the living \nman does not know the supreme truth in regard to Her . . . his desire \nfor liberation can only give rise to ridicule. From a part only of Kalika, the \nprimordial Shakti, arises Brahma, from a part only arises Vishnu, and \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n\n\nTantrasara, Nirvana \nTantra, etc.. Tantras are \nbasic scriptures of \nTantrism, many of \nwhich have yet to be \ntranslated from Sanskrit \nor other original \nlanguages into English. \nExtant texts date \nback to ca. 600 a.d., \nthough the material \nwas much older. \nAmong the most \npopular Hindu Tantras \nare the \n\nShaktisamgama, \nKularnava, \n\nMahanirvanatantra, and \nTantraraja. \n\n\n\n489 \n\n\n\nKali Ma from a part only arises Shiva. O fair-eyed Devi, just as rivers and lakes are \n\nunable to traverse a vast sea, so Brahma and other gods lose their \nseparate existence on entering the uncrossable and infinite being of Great \n\n^^^"^^^^^ Kali. Compared with the vast sea of the being of Kali, the existence of \n\nBrahma and the other gods is nothing but such a little water as is \ncontained in the hollow made by a cow\'s hoof. Just as it is impossible \nfor a hollow made by a cow\'s hoof to form a notion of the unfathomable \ndepths of a sea, so it is impossible for Brahma and other gods to have a \nknowledge of the nature of Kali. 8 \n\nEven the arrogant Vishnu, who claimed to have brought the \nwhole earth out of the primal abyss, received the grace of enlightenment \nconcerning Kali and wrote a poem about her: "Material cause of all \nchange, manifestation and destruction ... the whole Universe \nrests upon Her, rises out of Her and melts away into Her. From Her are \ncrystallized the original elements and qualities which construct \n\nthe apparent worlds. She is both mother and grave The gods \n\nthemselves are merely constructs out of Her maternal substance, \nwhich is both consciousness and potential joy." 9 \n\nThe Yogini Tantra said of Kali, "Whatever power anything \npossesses, that is the Goddess." 10 Shakti, "Power," was one of her \nimportant names. Without her, neither man nor god could act at all: \n\nIt is She as Power (Shakti) who takes the active and changeful part in \ngeneration, as also in conceiving, bearing, and giving birth to the \nWorld-Child. All this is the function of the divine, as it is of the human, \nmother. . . . It is thus to the Mother that man owes the World of Forms \nor Universe. Without Her as material cause, Being cannot display itself. It \nis but a corpse . . . primacy is given to the Mother, and it is said, "What \ncare I for the Father if I but be on the lap of the Mother?" \' \' \n\nA Tantric scholar points out that "the poets have found much \nmore intimate cries of the heart when they spoke of the Deity as their \n\'Mother\' than when they addressed themselves to God as Father." \nKali\'s poets approached her through love: "By feeling is She known. \nHow then can lack of feeling find Her?" In their view, "All is the \nMother and She is reality herself. \'Sa\'ham\' (She I Am) the Sakta says, \nand all that he senses is She in the form in which he perceives her. It \nis She who in, and as, him drinks the consecrated wine, and She is the \nwine." She feeds him as a mother feeds her child, and he becomes \nimmortal: "Deathless are those who have fed at the breast of the \nMother of the Universe." The Yoginihrdaya Tantra says, "Obei- \nsance to Her who is pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss, as Power, who \nexists in the form of Time and Space and all that is therein, and who \nis the radiant Illuminatrix in all beings." n \n\nAs a Mother, Kali was called Treasure-House of Compassion \n(karuna), Giver of Life to the world, the Life of all lives. Contrary to \nthe west\'s idea of her as a purely destructive Goddess, she was the fount \nof every kind of love, which flowed into the world only through her \nagents on earth, women. Thus it was said a male worshipper of Kali \n\n\n\n490 \n\n\n\n"bows down at the feet of women," regarding them as his rightful \nteachers. 13 \n\nThe name of Eve may have originated with Kali\'s leva or Jiva, the \nprimordial female principle of manifestation; she gave birth to her \n"first manifested form" and called him Idam (Adam). She also bore the \nsame title given to Eve in the Old Testament: Mother of All Living \n(Jaganmata). 17 \n\nAs the primal Deep, or menstrual Ocean of Blood at creation, Kali \nwas certainly the same as the biblical tehom, Tiamat, or tohu bohu, \nthe "flux" representing her state of formlessness between manifested \nuniverses. As Mahanila-Sarasvati the great blue River-Goddess, she \nwas probably the original namesake of the River Nile. As Kundalini the \nFemale Serpent, she resembled the archaic Egyptian serpent-mother \nsaid to have created the world. It was said of Kundalini that at the \nbeginning of the universe, she starts to uncoil in "a spiral line \nmovement which is the movement of creation." 18 This spiral line was \nvitally important in late Paleolithic and Neolithic religious symbolism, \nrepresenting death and rebirth as movement into the disappearing-point \nof formlessness, and out of it again, to a new world of form. Spirals \ntherefore appeared on tombs, as one of the world\'s first mystical \nsymbols. \n\nLunar priests of Sinai, formerly priestesses of the Moon-goddess, \ncalled themselves kafa. 22 Similar priestesses of prehistoric Ireland \nwere kelles, origin of the name Kelly, which meant a hierophantic clan \ndevoted to "the Goddess Kele" (see Kelle). 23 This was cognate with \nthe Saxon Kale, or Cale, whose lunar calendar or kalends included the \nspring month of Sproutkale, when Mother Earth (Kale) put forth \nnew shoots. 24 In antiquity the Phoenicians referred to the strait of \nGibraltar as Calpe, because it was considered the passage to the \nwestern paradise of the Mother. 25 \n\nIndo-European languages branched from the root of Sanskrit, said \nto be Kali\'s invention. She created the magic letters of the Sanskrit \nalphabet and inscribed them on the rosary of skulls around her neck. 27 \nThe letters were magic because they stood for primordial creative \nenergy expressed in sound Kali\'s mantras brought into being the very \nthings whose names she spoke for the first time, in her holy language. \nIn short, Kali\'s worshippers originated the doctrine of the Logos or \ncreative Word, which Christians later adopted and pretended it was \ntheir own idea. Kali\'s letters magically combined the elements, which \nwere previously separate as fiery-airy (male) or watery-earthy (fe- \nmale) forces. The former were "cruel"; the latter "benevolent." 28 This \ndistinction seemed to reflect the Tantric view of Kali as Lady of Life \nand her spouse as Lord of Death. \n\nThough called "the One," Kali was always a trinity: the same \nVirgin-Mother-Crone triad established perhaps nine or ten millenia \nago, giving the Celts their triple Morrigan; the Greeks their triple \nMoerae and all other manifestations of the Threefold Goddess; the \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n\n\nWestern scholars \nerroneously viewed the \nvarious \n\nmanifestations and \nincarnations of Kali \nas many different \nGoddesses, \nparticularly isolating \nthose primitive \nmatrikadevis (mother- \ngoddesses) grouped \ntogether as "Dravidian \nshe-ogres." H Yet \nKali\'s worshippers \nplainly \n\nstated that she had \nhundreds of different \nnames, but they were all \nthe same Goddess: \nSarasvati, Lakshmi, \nGayatri, Durga, \nAnnapurna, Sati, Uma, \nParvati, Gauri, \nBagala, Matangini, \nDhumavati, Tara, \nBhairavi, Kundalini, \nBharga, Devata, etc. \nAll were Kali Mahadevi, \nthe "Great \nGoddess" the same \ntitle she bore among \nwestern pagans. \' 5 \n\nSome of Kali\'s \nolder names found \ntheir way into the Bible. \nAs Tara, the earth, \nshe became Terah, \nmother of the \nHebrew ancestral spirits \ncalled teraphim. \nThe same Kali-Tara \nbecame the Celts\' \nTara, Gauls\' Taranis, \nEtruscans\' Turan, \nand the Latin Terra, \n"Mother Earth," \nsaid to be \n\ninterchangeable with \nVenus. 16 \n\n\n\n491 \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n\n\nVariations of Kali\'s \nbasic name occurred \nthroughout the \nancient world. The \nGreeks had a word \nKalli, meaning \n"beautiful," but \napplied to things that \nwere not particularly \nbeautiful such as the \ndemonic centaurs \ncalled kallikantzari, \nrelatives of Kali\'s \nAsvins. Their city of \nKallipolis, the \nmodern Gallipoli, was \ncentered in Amazon \ncountry formerly ruled \nby Artemis Kalliste. 19 \nThe annual birth \nfestival at Eleusis was \nKalligeneia, translatable \nas "coming forth \nfrom the Beautiful \nOne," or "coming \nforth from Kali." 20 The \ntemple of the Great \nMother of the Gods at \nPergamum stood on \nMount Mamurt-Kaleh, \neasily transposed into \nMount Mother- Kali. 21 \n\n\n\nKali\'s title Devi \n(Goddess) was similarly \nwidespread in Indo- \nEuropean languages. \nShe was the Latin \ndiva (Goddess) and Mi- \nnoan diwi or Diwija, \nthe "Goddess" associ- \nated with Zeus at \nKnossos. 26 Dia, Dea, \nand Diana were al- \nternate forms of the \nsame title. \n\n\n\nNorsemen their triple Norns; the Romans their triple Fates and triadic \nUni Quno); the Egyptians their triple Mut; the Arabs their triple \nMoon-goddess she was the same everywhere. Even Christians mod- \neled their threefold God on her archetypal trinity. 29 \n\nHer three forms were manifested in many ways: in the three \ndivisions of the year, the three phases of the moon, the three sections \nof the cosmos (heaven, earth, and the underworld), the three stages of \nlife, the three trimesters of pregnancy, and so on. Women repre- \nsented her spirit in mortal flesh. "The Divine Mother first appears in \nand as Her worshipper\'s earthly mother, then as his wife; thirdly as \nKalika, She reveals Herself in old age, disease and death." 50 \n\nThree kinds of priestesses tended her shrines: Yoginis or Shaktis, \nthe "Maidens"; Matri, the "Mothers"; and Dakinis, the \n"Skywalkers" who attended the dying, governed funerary rites and \nacted as angels of death. All had their counterparts in the spirit world. \nTo this day, Tantric Buddhism relates the three mortal forms of woman \nto the divine female trinity called Three Most Precious Ones. 31 \n\nKali\'s three forms appeared in the sacred colors known as Gunas: \nwhite for the Virgin, red for the Mother, black for the Crone, \nsymbolizing birth, life, death. 52 Black was Kali\'s fundamental color as \nthe Destroyer, for it meant the formless condition she assumed \nbetween creations, when all the elements were dissolved in her primor- \ndial substance. "As white, yellow, and other colors all disappear in \nblack, in the same way ... all beings enter Kali." 53 \n\nThe Black Goddess was known in Finland as Kalma (Kali Ma), a \nhaunter of tombs and an eater of the dead. 54 European "witches" \nworshipped her in the same funereal places, for the same reasons, that \nTantric yogis and dakinis worshipped her in cremation grounds, as \nSmashana-Kali, Lady of the Dead. 55 Their ceremonies were held in the \nplaces of ghosts where ordinary folk feared to go. 56 So were the \nceremonies of western "witches" that is, pagans. They adored the \nBlack Mother Earth in cemeteries, where Roman tombstones in- \nvoked her with the phrase Mater genuit, Mater recepit the Mother \nbore me, the Mother took me back. 57 \n\nSometimes Kali the Destroyer wore red, suggesting the blood of \nlife that she gave and took back: "As She devours all existence, as She \nchews all things existing with Her fierce teeth, therefore a mass of blood \nis imagined to be the apparel of the Queen of the Gods at the final \ndissolution." 58 The gypsies, who worshipped Kalika as a disease-causing \nGoddess they called "the Aunt," clothed her in red, the proper color \nfor gypsy funerals. 59 \n\nBlood was as much a part of Kali\'s worship as it was of the \nworship of the biblical God who said blood must be poured on his altars \nto bring remission of sins (Hebrews 9:22). The difference between \nthe western God\'s demand for blood and Kali\'s was that Jewish priests \ntook away the meat and ate it themselves (Numbers 18:9), whereas \ndevotees of Kali were permitted to eat their own offerings, as in \nCalcutta: \n\n\n\n492 \n\n\n\nThe temple serves simply as a slaughterhouse, for those performing the \nsacrifice retain their animals, leaving only the head in the temple as a \nsymbolic gift, while the blood flows to the Goddess. For to the Goddess is \ndue the lifeblood of all creatures since it is she who has bestowed it \nand that is why the beast must be slaughtered in her temple; that is why \ntemple and slaughterhouse are one. \n\nThis rite is performed amid gruesome filth; in the mud compounded \nof blood and earth, the heads of the animals are heaped up like trophies \nbefore the statue of the Goddess, while those sacrificing return home for a \nfamily banquet of the bodies of their animals. The Goddess desires only \nthe blood of the offerings, hence beheading is the form of sacrifice, since \nthe blood drains quickly from the beheaded beasts . . . ; the head \nsignifies the whole, the total sacrifice. * \n\nBeheading or throat-cutting were common methods of sacrifi- \ncial killing in the western world, too. "Kosher" killing for Yahweh \nconsisted, and still consists, of draining the animal\'s blood, because \nblood was the special food of deities. Kali demanded sacrifice of male \nanimals only, for they were expendable a custom harking back to \nthe primitive belief that males had no part in the cycles of generation. \nShiva himself, as Kali\'s sacrificial spouse, commanded that female \nanimals must never be slain at the altar. 41 \n\nKali was the Ocean of Blood at the beginning and end of the \nworld, and her ultimate destruction of the universe was prefigured by \ndestruction of each individual, though her karmic wheel always brought \nreincarnation. After death came nothing-at-all, which Tantric sages \ncalled the third of the three states of being; to experience it was like the \nexperience of Dreamless Sleep. This state was also called "the \nGenerative Womb of All, the Beginning and End of Beings." 42 Kali \ndevoured Time itself. At the end of Time, she resumed her "dark \nformlessness," which appeared in all the myths of before-creation and \nafter-doomsday as elemental Chaos. 43 \n\nThe mystical experience of Kali was often described as a preview \nof formlessness beyond the veil of death: a psychic return to the \nwomb, to be united with Kali\'s oceanic being. Thus Ramakrishna \ndescribed it: \n\n/ was suffering from excruciating pain because I had not been blessed with \na vision of the Mother. . . . I feared that it might not be my lot to realize \nher in this life. I could not bear the separation any longer; life did not seem \nto be worth living. Then my eyes fell on the sword that was kept in the \nMother\'s temple. Determined to put an end to my life, I jumped up and \nseized it, when suddenly the blessed Mother revealed herself to me. \n. . . the temple and all vanished, leaving no trace; instead there was a \nlimitless, infinite, shining ocean of consciousness or spirit. As far as the \neye could see, its billows were rushing towards me from all sides . . . to \nswallow me up. I was panting for breath. I was caught in the billows \nand fell down senseless. H \n\nRamakrishna revitalized the worship of the Mother, as his pupil \n/ivekananda said; "It was no new truths that Ramakrishna came to \n>reach, though his advent brought old truths to light." 45 Vivekananda \n\n\n\nKali Ma \n\n\n\nRamakrishna (1836 \n1886) Leading Hindu \nsaint of the 19th \ncentury, familiar in the \nwestern world \nthrough the teachings of \nhis famous disciple \nVivekananda. \n\n\n\n493 \n\n\n\nKama-Mara predicted the resurgence of the Mother into the consciousness of the \n\nKamsa world\'s population, after patriarchal religions had forced her into \n\n^^ mmt ^ mim ^^^^ concealment in the unconscious: "One vision I see clear as life before \nme, that the ancient mother has awakened once more, sitting on her \nthrone rejuvenated, more glorious than ever. Proclaim her to all the \nworld with the voice of peace and benediction." 46 Clearly, this \nGoddess was much more than the London Museum\'s "Destroying \nDemon." \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 149-53. 2.

The Upanishads said Kama- \nMara was the Self, source of both desire and fear. 1 But Mara was \nonce the mother of the Maruts or nature-spirits; Kama was the Vedic \nequivalent of Eros; it seems likely that they were combined in an \narchaic period as a sexual androgyne. The "demonic" combination \nexpressed the ascetics\' belief that eroticism drew the flesh of men \ntoward destruction. \n\nA Buddhist legend said the Blessed One met the challenge of \nKama-Mara by touching the earth with his fingers, thus invoking the \nirresistible power of the universal Mother, who protected him. 2 \n\n1.

Kamsa, King of the Bhojas, initiated \na Slaughter of Innocents when trying to kill the infant Krishna, his \nfuture conqueror. Kamsa killed only boy babies until Devaki brought \nforth a girl. The girl was killed too, and rose to heaven to become a \nGoddess. She visited Kamsa and told him, "Kamsa, Kamsa, since you \nattacked me to destroy me ... I will smash your body with my own \nhands and drink your warm blood." Kamsa realized that she had \nbecome his Death. 1 The myth was intended to support the taboo \nagainst killing females. \n\n1.0\'Flaherty,213. \n\n\n\n494 \n\n\n\nKara \n\n\n\nValkyrie swan-queen who defeated her enemies with magic songs, \nflying above them in her dress of swan feathers.

Kari \nwas also a primordial creatress, perhaps androgynous, who conceived \nthe first human beings by means of magic flowers (the yonic lotus) \nand gave birth to the human race. 1 Kari\'s voice spoke in the thunder. \n1. Hays, 352. \n\n\n\nKarma \n\nHindu concept of Fate, perhaps derived from Kauri-Ma, i.e., Kali \nMa. The usual symbol was a wheel, representing endless cycles of \nbecoming, every force or entity in the universe begetting equal and \nopposite reactions to its own action, all forces maintaining balance. The \nGoddess\'s law was that any individual evolution must be worked out \nby a series of reincarnations through the turnings of the great wheel of \ntime. Evil actions resulted in rebirth to a more evil life; good actions \nbrought lives of increasing virtue and happiness. Ascetic yogis of early \nBuddhism instituted the idea that one could take short cuts through \nthe cycles of time and escape altogether from the inexorable karmic \nwheel into a state of Nirvana or cosmic not-being, the individual \ndissolved in the infinite. \n\n\n\niruna \n\nrantric term for the basic quality of mother-love, directly experi- \nlced in infancy and ramified in adulthood to embrace all forms of love: \naching, tenderness, compassion, sensual enjoyment, and eroticism. \n\n\n\n495 \n\n\n\nKanjna Many centuries before Freudian psychology recognized "infantile sexu- \n\nality," Tantric sages called karuna the essence of religion: a gut \n_____ ______ feeling of loving-kindness, as opposed to the often cruel or useless \n\nverbalizing of theological principles. 1 It was understood that karuna \nmust be learned through physical and sexual contact comfort, by adults \nand children alike. Thus the identity of infantile, sexual, warmly \nloving, and religious behavior patterns was perceived long ago and is just \nnow being rediscovered by western civilization. \n\nThe ancients well knew the experience of being in love recapitu- \nlates the mother-child relationship in its intimate physical attachment, \ntrust, and dependence. Recognition of one particular other as a love \nobject surely evolved from the instinctive mechanism that binds \ntogether individual mothers and offspring. It has been shown even in \nthe animal realm that adequate sexual functioning in adulthood \ndepends on satisfactory relations with the mother in infancy. 2 \n\nIn ancient times the Goddess\'s sacred whores were special teachers \nof karuna, which may have been the root of modern Italian carogna, \n"whore." Pagan Rome gave the Great Goddess the title of Mater Cara, \n"Mother Beloved." 3 She combined all the qualities of sexuality, \nmotherhood, marital bliss, friendship, generosity and mercy, or caritas, \nwhich the Christian church later purged of its sensual implications \nand transformed into "charity," the giving of money to earn points in \nthe after-life. The Greek version of karuna was embodied in the \nCharites or Graces, the naked Triple Goddess, whose quality of "grace" \nwas also altered in the Christian context. In Babylon, the Great \nMother under the name of Ishtar was also the Great Whore and the \nlover of all men, expressing karuna in her self-description, "A \nprostitute compassionate am I." 4 \n\nThe Christian derivative of Mari-Ishtar was Mary Magdalene, \nthe sacred harlot who said harlots are "compassionate of all the \nrace of mankind." 5 Gnostic Gospels mentioned Mary Magdalene as the \noriginal female pope, embodying the true Christian spirit kept secret \nfrom male apostles, while it passed directly from Jesus through \nhis surpassing love for Mary. 6 Significantly, Christian iconographers \noften confused Mary the harlot and Mary the mother. See \nProstitution. \n\nMotherhood, sensual satisfactions, and kindly feelings were associ- \nated with the spirit of the Goddess under all her names, and especially \nwith women as her earthly representatives. The integrated idea of \nkaruna with all its ramifications has virtually disappeared from mod- \nern western society, where it is even difficult to explain its older \nmeanings. Yet "those modes of perceiving the world and organizing \nbehavior which are more distinctly \'female\' can\'t be thought of as \nhaving sprung into being in the context of the world we now inhabit. \n. . . We must think in terms of patterns of behaving that developed over \nuntold centuries, and which were keyed to survival of the human \ngroup in the primitive environment. Such a way of being would have \n\n\n\n496 \n\n\n\nbeen predicated upon powerful social bonds, \'bonds of love,\' which Kauri \n\nwould serve to keep otherwise more vulnerable individuals in close \n\nproximity to protectors." Every individual was to some extent in need ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nof protectors: "It may be that we feel loneliness to be so potentially \n\nannihilating because, to the lone human and above all, the lone \n\nhuman infant or child being alone was death." 7 \n\nWestern culture began to lose sight of the close relationship \nbetween sensuality and loving-kindness when its theology followed \nSt. Augustine to his conclusion that every child is born tainted with sin \nbecause of its necessarily sexual conception. 8 Nearly all manifesta- \ntions of love fell under theological suspicion because nearly all involved \nthe feminine principle in some way. (See Romance.) "Men\'s sexual \ndrive was unacceptable to them and so it was projected onto women. It \nwas women whose lust was said to be insatiable. . . . [V]iewing wom- \nan as seductress and temptress is still evident, as can be seen by the fact \nthat prostitutes, but seldom their customers, are arraigned, and the \nfact that the rape victim is often seen as having \'asked for\' her attack by \ndressing or behaving seductively." 9 \n\nIn a society that lacks any coherent articulation of the concept of \nkaruna, women as mothers, lovers, and caretakers "learn early that \nthey should be ashamed of the very set of qualities which are particularly \ntheirs. Ironically, at the same time, they are constantly threatened by \nthe prospect that if they are not affectionate enough and as close and \nloving to others as they ought to be, they will have failed in their own \nand others\' eyes." The result is "a noxious social climate which fosters \ntoo little feeling in men and too much in women." 10 \n\nLoss of this all-important concept may create social evils of the \nmost pervasive sort. "Male public culture gets caught up with \nmachines and puts emphasis on things that are not alive. The decision- \nmaking of males in power tends to happen in a vacuum with little \nreference to the needs of life. Paradoxically, the public leaders who are \nsupposed to help us deny death become increasingly oblivious to life \nand show increasing contempt for it. We have a civilization in which \nmales in high places imitate a male god in heaven both think \nthemselves above the petty concerns of simple nurture and delight in \ngenerative life." 11 \n\n1.

Kauri was \nsometimes translated "Brilliant One," a name for the Goddess\'s virgin \naspect: she who gave their "Power" (Shakti) to the gods. 1 Kauri was \nalso a name for the vulva (yoni), descriptive of the cowrie shell accepted \n\n\n\n497 \n\n\n\nKelle all over the world as a symbol of the female genital and its curative \n\nKeres and generative properties. \n\n^^^t^m^^^m^^^^^m 1. Larousse, 375. \n\n\n\nvar. Kelly Kelle \n\nIrish-druidic priest-name, derived from pre-Christian holy harlots of \nthe Goddess Kelle, Kale, or Kali. Irish writings described the divine \nharlot Mary Magdalene as a kelle. 1 The medieval term Kele-De was \nconsidered somewhat mysterious, translated "Bride of God" if a wom- \nan, "Servant of God" if a man. 2 These translations were inaccurate. \nKele-De meant literally the spirit of the Goddess Kele, evidently \nidentical with the Goddess Kali of the original Indo-European Celts. \n\nVotaries of the Goddess Kele stressed the search for inward \nperfection through meditation, yogic style. 5 Her gods assumed the \nlotus position like eastern yogis. Her primitive Grail hero, Peredur, \nexperienced her as the "most beautiful woman in the world," \nrepresented by the three colors of the Divine Prakriti, still known as the \nGunas, standing for her powers of creation, preservation, and \ndestruction. 4 \n\nThe mythical "St. Kilda" seems to have been another version of \nthe Goddess Kele, dwelling on a remote rocky islet once identified \nwith the western paradise of the dead. St. Kilda\'s Isle still exists, but the \norigin of its name has been forgotten. The ubiquitous Irish word kill, \na cell or cave, once meant a shrine of Kele, whose holy men called \nthemselves Culdees, Colidees, Cele-De, Keledio, etc. Some were \ndescribed in Christian histories as monks, though they were obviously \nmarried. 5 \n\nKildare was a major shrine of the Goddess Kilda- Kele, or Brigit, \nidentified with the virgin Mary after Christian monks appropriated \nthe site. But the guardianship of the sacred fire at Kildare had long been \na prerogative of priestesses; the shrine was forbidden to men. 6 \nConfusion of Kilda-Kele-Brigit with Mary was not too far-fetched, as \nthey had been aspects of the same Goddess for thousands of years in \nIndia as Kali-Mari or Kel-Mari, the Pot Goddess who made human \nforms out of clay. 7 (See Kali Ma.) \n\n1.

"I had union with my hand, and ... I poured seed into my \nown mouth, and I sent forth from myself issue in the form of . . . Shu \nand Tefnut." Khepera insisted he was the sole creator; "there was no \nother being who worked with me." Yet like all gods he was forced to \ndepend on a mother-symbol. He said, "I laid a foundation in Maa," \nthe Goddess as primal matter. 2 \n\nFinally the mother-symbol re-absorbed him. Some said Khepera \nhad no reproductive power until he received an eye of the female \nmoon, which could give birth to plants and animals.

Baring-Gould, C.M.M.A., 375. \n\n\n\nKingship \n\niln early Asiatic civilizations, kingship depended on the choices of \nwomen. There was no law of primogeniture. Kings were rarely suc- \nceeded by their sons. Kings of Sumeria and Assyria were of unknown \nfatherhood. King Esakkuruna was called "the son of Nobody." \' \nWomen were the kingmakers in the lands he ruled. 2 \n\nMarriage with the earthly representative of the Goddess, in the \nform of the queen, was essential to the position of kingship; this was \nfthe original meaning of "holy matrimony" (hieros gamos). Akkadian \nkings apparently went on military expeditions chiefly to prove them- \nselves worthy of the sacred marriage. 3 \n\nAshurbanipal said he ruled by the grace of the Goddess Ishtar; he \nwas the king "whom her hands created." Shamash-shum-ukin of \nipabylon said he was chosen for kingship by the same Goddess under \ntier title of Erua, Queen of the Gods. King Esarhaddon of Assyria \nsaid he was "beloved of Queen Ishtar, the goddess of everything, the \nunsparing weapon, who brings destruction to the land of the \nenemy." 4 Ishme-Dagan, king of Isin in 1860 B.C., said he was "he \nwhom Inanna, queen of heaven and earth, has chosen for her \nt>eloved husband." 5 The Bronze Age king Ixion of Thessalian Lapiths \njmarried the Mother of the Gods after killing her former mate, \nflescribed as his father-in-law, because each king\'s successor was sup- \niposed to call his defeated rival "father." 6 The queens were the same \n|s Goddess, or Mother of God. The pharaoh Amenhotep III built a \ni temple for his wife Ti, who was worshipped as the Goddess. 7 \n\nThe goddess-queen\'s choice largely depended on the candidate\'s \n\n\n\n501 \n\n\n\nKingship sex appeal. If she tired of the king\'s lovemaking, he could be deposed \n\nor killed, for the queen\'s sexual acceptance of him determined the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ fertility of the land. In many early societies the old king was killed by \nthe new king, usually called a "son" though he was no blood relative. \nHence the unbroken chain of Oedipal murders that puzzled modern \nscholars before it was known that the words "father" and "son" were \nused in a different sense. A Babylonian tablet says: \n\nHaharni laid claim for himself to lordship over Dunnu. Earth raised her \nface to her son Amakandu. "Come let me make love to you " she said \nto him. Amakandu took his mother (for a wife) and Haharni his father he \nkilled; in Dunnu, which he loved, they laid him forest. And Amakandu \ntook over his father\'s lordship and Nether Sea, his sister, he took (as wife). \nLahar, son of Amakandu, came and Amakandu he killed, and in \nDunnu, in the (tomb) of his father he caused him to rest. Nether Sea, his \nmother, he took (as wife). 8 \n\nAfter this, Lahar\'s son killed Lahar and took his sister River as \nwife; he in turn was killed by his son, who married his sister Ningesh- \ntinna, "Lady of the Vine of Heaven," a shortened name of the \nGoddess Nin-gest-inanna. Sovereignty passed from mother to daughter, \nbeginning with Earth, the Goddess Dunnu herself, foundress of the \nline the same as Crete\'s Danuna, Anatolia\'s Danu, Greece\'s Danae, \nthe Gaulish Diana. Kings were expected to kill their predecessors or \npseudo-fathers. "Son" meant "successor," and "sister" was synonymous \nwith "wife." 9 \n\nThe length of a king\'s reign was often predetermined, because \npeople thought the Goddess needed the refreshment of a new lover \nat stated intervals. Up to 1810 a.d., kings of Zimbabwe were ceremoni- \nally strangled to death by their wives at the moon temple every four \nyears. 10 Kings of ancient Thebes reigned for seven years; so did kings of \nCanaan. Myths suggest a similar seven-year period for each king of \nCrete. Cretan kings were never allowed to grow old; they always died in \nthe full bloom of youth. 11 More recently, Nigerian kings were \nstrangled after the queen\'s pregnancy was established, which meant \neach king fulfilled his role in life by begetting one royal offspring. 12 \n\nWhite explorers in Africa spoke of tribal "kings," but rarely \nmentioned that the real rulers of the tribes were queens. "In the \noldest times there were no reigning princes in Africa, but the negroes \nhad large kingdoms [sic] which were ruled by goddesses." 1? Ghana \nwas governed by kings of a matrilineal succession whose divine right \npassed through sisters\' sons. The Lovedu were ruled by a female \n"king" who took a series of lovers but always left the government to one \nof the royal princesses. 14 Angola was ruled by women until the \nPortuguese invasions. Ashanti was ruled by queens until the British \nProtectorate in 1895. Its kings were subject to the queen mother; its \nprincesses took no husbands but kept a series of lovers. Similar customs \nobtained in Loango, Daura, the country of the Abrons, and other \n\n\n\n502 \n\n\n\n\\frican nations. The queen of Ubemba was called Mamfumer, Kingship \n\n\'Mother of Kings," and did all the governing. 15 \n\nThe Gospels\' "Candace queen of the Ethiopians" (Acts 8:27) was ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nlot a single individual but the hereditary title of queen mothers who \n{governed the Nubian states. 16 Ethiopian kings were ritually slain from \nhe earliest times. Regicide was still the custom of Nubian Kassites of \nhe Upper Nile in the 1st century b.c. Diodorus said only one Ethiopian \nTionarch escaped this kingly fate because he was educated in Greece \nnd dared to disobey tribal law. He led a party of soldiers into the \nsanctuary and killed all the priests before they could kill him. 17 \n\nThe Javanese Singasari dynasty had matriarchal queens similar to \nCandace, typified by Queen Dedes whose statues show her as a \npeautiful Shakti of wisdom. She married a number of new kings after \n[hey killed her previous consorts, each apparently holding office for a \nlieven-year period. 18 \n\nLegends consistently associate kingship with ceremonial death. A \nteal from Lagash shows the Goddess taking her new king by the \nland, while he raises a weapon to slay the old king, prostrate under the \nqueen\'s feet. 19 King Sennacherib of Assyria was "beaten to death \nvith statuettes of the gods" in the temple at Nineveh. Perpetrators of \n[he deed were his "sons," one of whom succeeded him as King \nEsarhaddon. Upon his accession, Esarhaddon proclaimed: "I am power- \nful, I am omnipotent, I am a hero, I am gigantic, I am colossal! " 20 \n\nSometimes, kings had to proclaim they were embodiments of the \nGoddess herself so as to rule with the same authority as queens. \nKntiochus of Commagene announced that he could rule because he \nUe5 the Goddess. 21 A king\'s investiture used to mean putting on \nfemale robes, so the king could be displayed as a transvestite Goddess \n[see Transvestism). \n\nIn the ancient Middle East generally, kings were not so much \ngoverning figures as ceremonial ones, primarily concerned with \nDedication of temples and other religious responsibilities. 22 Sometimes \n[hey were also war leaders, able to preserve their lives in time of \ndanger by convincing the people that no one else could defeat the \npnemy. In such a case, a surrogate victim might be found a real or \nadopted son, a prophet, a condemned criminal, or a divine animal. \n\nA war leader of Carthage "clothed his best and most beloved son \nn royal robes and crucified him as a sacrifice" to secure the blessing \npf Baal on his military campaigns. 23 Similarly, the god-king Isra-El \nclothed his only-begotten son Ieud in royal robes and sacrificed him \n[\'according to the custom of the Jews," as Philo said. 24 This king \nbecame Jesus, "king" of the Jews (John 18:33). Since a king was \nGod, any king\'s real or adopted son was naturally the Son of God; and \npahweh himself was embodied in the Jewish king. "In the early \nperiod of the Hebrew monarchy the central element of the annual New \npear festival was the ritual enthronement of Jahveh as King." 25 \n\nSon-killing was a habit, not only of the Jewish god-king but of \n\n\n\n503 \n\n\n\nKingship many other god-kings who modified the old custom by shedding the \n\nblood of someone else in the proper season. A Swedish king named \n^ H ^^^^^ H Aun managed to extend his reign for nine years by sacrificing one of \nhis nine sons each year to ransom his own life. 26 \n\nAnother Swedish king named Gunnar Helming simply ran away. \nAfter wrestling with the god Frey, incarnate in the previous king as \nbiblical Jacob wrestled with "a man who was God" and later received \nthe king-name of Isra-El Gunnar Helming took the king\'s place in \nthe bed of the high priestess (or Goddess). Evidently he pleased her, for \nwith her help he gathered up all the gold and silver treasures of kingly \noffice and escaped, taking her with him. 27 A similar story was told of \nTheseus\'s escape from the Minoan sacred king\'s fate with the help of \nthe priestess Ariadne, the incarnate Moon-goddess, who had taken a \nfancy to him. 28 \n\nSeleucus Nicator of Antioch, formerly one of Alexander\'s gener- \nals, became king of Syria but was forced to abdicate in favor of his \n"son" Antiochus, because the queen fell in love with the younger man \nand cast off her old spouse. 29 As late as 97 a.d., kings of Antioch were \n"chosen for merit" and deposed when their "merit" failed. This "merit\' \nseemed to have to do with their sexual capacity. 30 That is, it was virtu, \n"virility," from vir, "man." \n\nA common method of choosing a king was to test his virility by \nhaving him look on the Goddess\'s nakedness during the ritual bath that \nmagically restored her virginity each year. Actaeon, Teiresias, and \nlovers of the Germanic Earth Goddess were chosen by so viewing her. 51 \nGyges was chosen by the queen of Lydia, who bore the name of the \nGoddess Omphale, upon her display of her naked body to him; he was \ntold to kill the incumbent king and marry her. 32 Bath-Sheba, whose \nname meant she was the daughter of Arabian queens, married King \nDavid after he saw her naked in her bath, and killed her previous \nhusband, Uriah the Hittite (2 Samuel, 1 1). The Goddess Ishtar pre- \nsented herself naked to her would-be lovers, saying, "Let us enjoy thy \nmanly strength. Let thy hand [or, phallus] come forth and take away my \nvirginity." 33 \n\nSuch legends point to a custom of choosing a king by the \npromptness of his erection upon the sight of the naked Goddess. \nPeople would follow only a leader of proven sexual potency, as shown \nby the transparent sexual metaphors of the 1 10th Psalm: "The Lord \nshall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of \nthine enemies. Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in I \nthe beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning; thou hast the \ndew of thy youth." Dew was the biblical word for semen, rod meant \nphallus, Zion was the Holy Mount, otherwise the body of the Virgin \nIsrael. \n\nWhen the king\'s youth and dew deserted him, so did his people, \nwho considered it dangerous to keep an impotent king in office. A \n\n\n\n504 \n\n\n\n*m \n\n\n\n[declining birth rate or a poor growing season could bring on a king- Kingship \n\nailing. Proverbs 14 says, "In the multitude of people is the king\'s \n\nnonor; but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince." \n\nNorthern Europeans believed in killing kings at the failure of their ^^^^^"^ \n%aefa or heill (virility, divine force), made manifest through failure of \ndie land\'s fertility. Crops went bad in the reign of Domaldi; his subjects \n:ried sacrificing oxen, then men, to no avail; finally they fell on the \nBang and butchered him. As late as the 9th century a.d., King Halfdan \nbf Norway was slain for the sake of the crops. 34 Writings falsely \nattributed to St. Patrick expressed the Celtic conviction that the reign of \na potent king would be distinguished by fine weather, calm seas, \nabundant grain, and trees laden with fruit. 35 \n\nCeremonial killing of kings was an ancient Latin custom, dating \n}ack to the obscure period of Roman history that is now virtually \nunknown, because later priesthoods destroyed its records. 36 Early Ro- \nman kings usually met death by "assassination" in the month of \nMarch, beginning the sacred year. 37 King Tatius was slain at the altar \nivith sacred knives: a suspiciously stylized death. Julius Caesar met a \nSimilarly ritualistic death at the fatal time, the Ides of March, in the \nt>acred inner chamber of the senate, on the very dais of the altar, in \nFulfillment of a prophetic announcement by his wife. \n\nThere is some doubt as to whether Caesar\'s wife was considered a \nportal woman or an embodiment of the Goddess whom Caesar wor- \nshipped for the sake of his victories in battle: Venus Genetrix. After \ndefeating Pompey, he built her a marble and gold temple in the \nForum and had his own statue placed before her as her consort. The \ndrama of his life and death contained elements common to other \nsacred kings who were consorts of the Goddess. \n\nAt the beginning of his career, Caesar dreamed of copulating with \nhis own mother, and the seers prophesied from this that he would \nrule the earth (Mother). On the eve of his assassination he attended a \nFeast or Last Supper and was asked, "What is the best kind of death?" \nHe replied, "The kind that is least expected." On the following day he \nreceived the kind of death he had chosen. Later, during the funerary \ngames in honor of Venus Genetrix, a comet was identified as the soul of \nPaesar enroute to the company of the gods. 38 \n\nJulius Caesar\'s successor Augustus received his title by marrying \nLivia Augusta, who planned the rebuilding programs in Rome and \nalso revitalized the worship of her Goddess, Juno Augusta. Though \nLivia\'s contributions to the glories of the Augustan Age have been \njelittled by Christian historians, there is no doubt that she was a full co- \n"uler and the real author of many of Augustus\'s legal reforms and \nmunicipal projects. There was a vague understanding, never fully \nnvestigated, that like the previous Caesar\'s wife, Livia somehow \n\'hastened her husband\'s end." 39 \n\nBy Roman law of matrilineal succession, Augustus was succeeded \n\n\n\n505 \n\n\n\nKingship by Tiberius, Livia\'s firstborn son by another man. The title of \n\nAugustus passed through the female line even up to the time of \nmmmmmmmm ^^^ mm Constantine, who received his throne through a marriage with the \nprincess Fausta. 40 \n\nThe title of Caesar (Kaiser, Czar) passed on to Germanic emper- \nors in the Dark Ages when legends of heroes and sacred kings usually \nincluded the ritual death. Siegfried suffered a typical Caesar\'s death, \nbrought on by his wife\'s prophetic dream. His wife personally \nembroidered on his robe the cross marking the spot where the slayer\'s \nspear must strike. 41 \n\nSt. Caesarius, whose name meant "king," was another fictitious \nsaint based on the old custom of king-killing. He was the Kaiser slain \nas an embodiment of Apollo at Terracina. The man impersonating the \nking would run through lines of spectators and leap from a cliff, as the \nmythical saint was said to have done. 42 The festival of "St. Caesarius" \nwas All Hallows, the pagan holy day of ancestral ghosts (see \nHalloween). \n\nSimilar deification or sainthood seems to have been the purpose ol \nthe mysterious Liebestod (Love-Death) of Attila the Hun, who \nappears in the Germanic Nibelungen saga under the name of Atli or \nEtzel, in the company of other heroes such as Siegfried. Attila\'s last \nbride bore the name of Germanic death-goddess, Grimhild or Kriem- \nhild. According to Marcellinus, Grimhild killed Attila in their \nmarriage bed on their wedding night. 43 Other sources more euphemisti \ncally said he died suddenly in the arms of his bride, smothered by "an \neffusion of blood." That his killing might have been deliberately \nplanned, to make him a god, is suggested by his burial with all the \ntrappings of a sacred Caesar: a triple coffin of sun, moon, and earth \nmetals gold, silver, and iron. His gravediggers were all slain so his \ntomb would be kept secret. 44 His funeral rites consisted of a brief period \nof extravagant mourning, followed by a joyful feast representing his \napotheosis. His future Second Coming was expected. \n\nMen who played the fatal role of the king in classic sacred dramas \nwere often deified (canonized) to induce them to serve as surrogates \nfor the real king. Like Christian martyrs, they believed that once past th \n"veil," they would enjoy blissful immortality, identified like the ruler \nwith the supreme god himself. Thus, many stories show men willingly \nassuming the fatal role. Antinous, a favorite of the emperor Hadrian, \nsacrificed himself in a magical ceremony to preserve the emperor\'s \nlife. 45 Each winter, the Roman festival of the Saturnalia featured a \nman who played the part of the Lord of Death, identified with both the \nemperor and the god Saturn. 46 The latter was the Heavenly Father in \nhis underground, "slain" aspect, as Shava the Corpse stood for Father \nShiva in the same attitude of death. See Shiva. \n\nThe Roman word for a king, rex or reg, descended from Sanskrit \nraj, as did the Celtic rig.* 7 Not only the word but the concept of the \n\n\n\n506 \n\n\n\noffice migrated all over the Eurasian continent, making a king\'s sover- Kingship \n\neignty dependent on his acceptance by the land, which was always \n\nembodied in women. The idea is still discernible in a Tartar custom: a ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nchief\'s son must be carried about to every village and suckled by \n\nevery nursing mother to validate his later claim to leadership. 48 The land \n\nwas a king\'s eternal mother-bride. King James I of England referred \n\nto a tradition of immemorial antiquity when he said, "I am the husband \n\nand the whole island is my lawful wife." 49 The Welsh long believed \n\nthe British isles were annexed to Rome only through a sacred marriage \n\nbetween the Roman emperor and the British queen, the Lily Maid \n\nElen. Welsh bards also said their own Llefelys became king of France \n\nby marrying the queen and gaining "the crown of the kingdom along \n\nwith her." 50 \n\nLike early kings of Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Greece, and Rome, \npre-Christian British kings became stewards of the country through a \nhieros gamos with the queen. The Danish historian Saxo Grammati- \ncus said of Hermutrude, queen of Scotland, that "whomsoever she \nthought worthy of her bed was at once a king, and she yielded her \nkingdom with herself." 51 Pictish kings were selected by the royal \nwomen from a matrilineal blood line. Early Saxon queens governed \ntheir land, and a king could govern only by marrying them. 52 That is \nwhy King Canute married the widow of his predecessor; and Ethelbald, \nking of the West Saxons, married his father\'s widow. Another \nEthelbald, king of Kent, married his stepmother after his father\'s \ndeath. 53 \n\nBritish romances show kings unable to rule unless they possessed \nthe queen, whose name was often given as Guinevere also ren- \ndered Cunneware, Gwenhwyfar, Jennifer, Ginevra, or Genevieve. \nSome early sources say there were three of her (the Triple Goddess). \nKing Arthur married all three. 54 Repeated abductions of her by Melea- \ngant, by Lancelot, by Melwas, by Arthur, and by Mordred signified \nmany would-be kings\' claim to sovereignty. 55 The collapse of Arthur\'s \nkingdom was intimately related to his loss of the queen. \n\nIn pagan Ireland a king\'s inaugural greeting announced that he \nwas wedded to (literally, had copulated with) his land, in the person \nof the queen. The legendary Irish Queen Mab, famous in folklore as \nthe Fairy Queen, chose and invested her kings and changed her \nlovers often. 56 \n\nRivalries between kings ruler and tanist, father and son, royal \n"dragon" and his dragonslayer preserve in mythology the arche- \ntypal sexual jealousy that related male power to acceptance by the \nfemale, and male powerlessness to sexual rejection. The myth of \nFinn and Diarmuid plainly shows the chieftains\' jealous counter-claims \nto Queen Grianne (Ygraine), another form of Guinevere. King \nArthur\'s death scene was prefigured by the story of Finn\'s three trips to \nbring healing waters to the wounded Diarmuid; but each time he \n\n\n\n507 \n\n\n\nKingu deliberately let the water trickle through his fingers, so Diarmuid died. \n\nKiss Finn said smugly to his younger, handsomer rival: "Well it pleases \n\n^ m ^ m f^ me, O Diarmuid, to see you in this plight, and it grieves me only that all \nthe women of Erin are not now gazing on you; for your extraordinary \nbeauty is now ugliness, and your choice form a deformity." 57 \n\nAn old English custom of "lifting" the king at Easter time suggests \nthe former importance of women in every aspect of the king\'s career, \nincluding his selection, approval, love-death, and apotheosis. The king \nwas heaved up into the air each year by a group of court ladies. \nThough piously called an imitation of "our Savior\'s resurrection," the \ncustom was obviously older than Christianity; it was pagan, not \nChristian, theology that made gods and kings one and the same, both \nsubject to the magic of women. 58 \n\nX.Assyr. & Bab.

Scholars believe kissing originated Knighthood \n\nwith mouth-to-mouth feeding, practiced among ancient Greeks and Knights Templar \n\nothers as a form of love play. In Germany and Austria even up to the ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n19th century a.d. it was common for mothers to premasticate food \n\nand feed it to their infants by "kissing." l Kissing was most common in \n\nEuropean countries, where it was supposed to create a bond among \n\nall members of a clan (hence, "kissing cousins"). It was virtually \n\nunknown in northern Asia (Japan, China, Mongolia).

Touching \nfirst one shoulder then the other with a sword implied that the sword \nhad passed through the neck. Celtic tribes especially revered man-gods \nwho were preserved in the form of severed heads, which were \nbelieved to give oracles. In Greece also, savior-gods like Orpheus spoke \nto their followers of the after-life through the mouths of their own \nmummified heads. Symbolic beheading also "knighted" men dedicated \nto the Goddess Artemis in her Spartan shrines, where the man so \ndedicated received a slight cut in his neck from the edge of a sword. 1 \n\n1. Graves, CM. 2, 79. \n\n\n\nKnights Templar \n\nThe Order of Knights of the Temple was founded in the Holy Land \nin 1118 a.d. by a Burgundian knight, Hugues de Payens or Payns, that \nis, "Hugh of the Pagans." \' Its organization was based on that of the \nSaracen fraternity of hashishim, "hashish-takers," whom Christians \ncalled Assassins (see Aladdin). 2 The Templars\' first headquarters \nwas a wing of the royal palace of Jerusalem next to the al-Aqsa mosque, \nrevered by the Shi\'ites as the central shrine of the Goddess Fatima. 5 \n\nWestern romances, inspired by Moorish Shi\'ite poets, transformed \nthis Mother-shrine into the Temple of the Holy Grail, where certain \nlegendary knights called Templars gathered to offer their service to the \nGoddess, to uphold the female principle of divinity and to defend \nwomen. (See Grail, Holy.) These knights became more widely known \nas Galahad, Perceval, Lohengrin, etc. \n\nThe real Knights Templar, however, professed Christianity and \nassumed the duty of protecting Christian pilgrims and merchants \ntraveling through the Holy Land. They also undertook to protect the \ntravelers\' lands, castles, and other properties back home, where \n\n\n\n509 \n\n\n\nKnights Templar Templars from Jerusalem arrived to take charge. When pilgrims failed \n\nto return from their journeys, the property could pass into the \n^^^^^^^^^^ m Templars\' permanent possession. As a result, like other holy orders \nfounded on a vow of poverty, the Templars soon became very rich. \n\nAt first the Knights Templar had difficulty getting papal sanction \nfor their military order. The papacy refused to recognize them until a \nvindication of their aims was written by St. Bernard, whose uncle joined \nthe order and became a Grand Master. The Templars\' original \ncharter, signed by Pope Innocent II, granted them freedom from papal \nclaims on their property, even from church taxation. This financial \nindependence was to prove their downfall. \n\nHaving acquired estates and treasure houses throughout France, \nSpain, Portugal, and the Levant, the Templars were leading bankers \nand moneylenders of the 13 th century. They served kings and mer- \nchant princes. Their own treasure ships plied the eastern \nMediterranean coasts. Their reputation for honesty was such that even \nMoslems trusted them. Eventually, Pope Clement V and King Philip \nIV of France, whose government was nearly bankrupt, joined forces to \ndeprive the Templars of their money and their lives. \n\nEarly in the 14th century, the Templars were accused of orga- \nnized heresy, devil worship, ritual sodomy, and blasphemy. It was \nclaimed they adored an androgynous idol named Baphomet, "having \nsometimes three faces, sometimes two, or only one, and sometimes a \nbare skull, which they called their savior, and believed its influence to be \nexerted in making them rich, and in making flowers grow and the \nearth germinate." 4 \n\nThe rumor-mongers claimed the Templars\' secret rites involved \ndenial of Christ, treading on the cross, forcing initiates into homosex- \nual acts, kissing the devil\'s genitals, and similar charges that were to \nbecome monotonously familiar in witch persecutions. Grand Master \nJacques de Molay and other dignitaries of the order were arrested and \nconfessed under torture that they had indeed done such things, with \nthe aim of teaching newly initiated Knights unquestioning obedience to \ntheir superiors\' commands. Later, Molay and his associates publicly \nrenounced their confessions, saying they had been forced by torture. In \n13l4 they proclaimed their innocence before a large crowd of people \nand were burned at the stake as relapsed heretics the same afternoon. 5 \n\nThe order was suppressed with great cruelty. With the church\'s \nblessing, local barons in France, Cyprus, Castile, and other areas \nsimply murdered the Knights and took their properties. Captured \nTemplars were forced to confess to every sort of crime, most \napparently invented by their judges. It was found that each Templar \nconfessed to one set of sins when tortured by one judge and a \ncompletely different set when tortured by a different judge. 6 Trials were \ntransparently rigged. During the trial of Templars at Paris, the court \nrepeatedly refused to hear depositions from no fewer than 573 witnesses \nfor the defense. 7 \n\n\n\n510 \n\n\n\nA few Templars managed to flee to England, where torture was Knot \n\ni not legal. This made it impossible to obtain what Pope Clement \n\ncalled "true evidence," meaning evidence extorted by torture. The ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nI pope wrote to King Edward II, demanding that the Templars be \n; arrested and tortured. Otherwise, Edward and his court would be \nexcommunicated as impeders of the Inquisition. As a bribe, Edward \nwas offered a Plenary Indulgence for all his past sins. Finally he \nj permitted papal judges to torture the Templars, changing the English \nI law "out of reverence for the Holy See." 8 The indispensable utility of \nItorture was thus established, and "the success of the extermination of \nthe Templars set the patterns for the subsequent persecution of \nI witches." 9 \n\nScholars have tried to determine the truth, if any, of the charges \njagainst the Templars. Most agree that the Templars "had adopted \nsome of the mysterious tenets of the eastern Gnostics." 10 Their alleged \nidol Baphomet may have been the Triple Head of Wisdom pictured \nion the arms of the order\'s founder, in the form of three black Saracen \nheads. 11 On the other hand, no idol of Baphomet was ever found in \nkhe Templars\' houses or shrines, though these were seized and sealed \nimmediately. 12 \n\nTemplars were accused of "making a fig" at the crucifix with their \npands; but this derisive sexual symbol was not a mockery by eastern \nstandards. Orientals called it a knowledge sign, the feminine counterpart \npf the phallic cross; in India it was a lingam-yoni. 1? If the Templars \ntrampled a crucifix, they may have copied the custom of Arab dervishes \nIvho ceremonially rejected a cross with the words, "You may have the \nCross, but we have the meaning of the Cross." H As for the charge of \nBodomy, no monastic order was free of that. Men cut off from \nLvomen were no less prone to homosexual behavior in the 13th century \nman in the prisons, barracks, lumber and mining camps, and boys\' \nSchools of the 20th. \n\nI. Shah, xix. 2.

Marriage is still called "tying the knot" because it \nused to be viewed as a binding of two life-threads by the Goddess \nAphrodite, or Juno. Egyptians\' Isis-Hathor bound or loosed the lives of \nmen with Tat, the Knot of Fate, and taught the art of making magic \nInots. Sometimes she bore the title of the knot itself, Tait. High-ranking \nEgyptians were promised she would personally weave their cere- \nments, including "bandages from the hand of Tait." l In Egypt, holy \nmysteries in general were shetat, "she-knots." 2 \n\n\n\n511 \n\n\n\nKnot The Knot of Fate came into Greek myth as the famous Gordian \n\nKnot severed by the sword of Alexander, in fulfillment of the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^m prophecy that whoever could "unravel" the knot would become lord of \nall Asia. The original knot was the marriage tie of Phrygia\'s sacred \nking, alternately Gordius or Midas, sons and bridegrooms of the Magna \nMater. The knot was fastened to the yoke of the oxcart on which \nGordius entered into his kingdom, as the oracle announced in terms \nsimilar to the Bible\'s description of Jesus\'s triumphal entry into \nJerusalem: "Phrygians, your new king is approaching with his bride, \nseated in an ox-cart!" 3 \n\nPagan religions related the art of knotting to "binding" and \n"loosing" the forces of creation and destruction, the same power \nclaimed by the papacy for the alleged heirs of St. Peter (Matthew \n16:19). (See Peter, Saint.) The windings of Fate and the mysteries \nof Nature were often symbolized by elaborate knotwork, as in the \nintricate knot-patterns of Scandinavian and Saracenic monuments. \n\nWitches of Finland, Lapland, and the northern islands bound the \nwinds in magic knots and sold them to credulous sailors, who would \nuse the knots to try to control the winds at sea, as Odysseus\'s sailors did \nwith Aeolus\'s bag of winds. Such magic was still common in the late \n16th century. 4 Scottish witches were said to raise winds and storms by \nsoaking a knotted rag in water and beating it on a stone to make drops \nfly like rain, saying: \n\nIknok this rag upone this stane \n\nTo raise the wind in the divellis name \n\nIt sail not lye till I please againe. 5 \n\nIn 1814 Sir Walter Scott found one Bessie Millie selling "winds \nby the devil\'s help" to sailors in the form of knotted cords. 6 British \nwitches claimed to stop nosebleeds by tying knots in red thread, the \nclassic Fate-weaver\'s blood symbol. 7 Weaver\'s thread was also thought \nto cure "diseases of the groin" when knotted with a widow\'s name \npronounced at each knot. 8 On the other hand, witches could make men \nimpotent with a magic knot called "ligature." Predictably, men said \nthis was a "detestable impiety" deserving the death penalty. According \nto a canon of the church, God\'s opinion was self-contradictory. \nLigature could occur only with God\'s permission and could be cured \nonly "with God\'s help." 9 \n\nThe Jews so feared magic knots that rabbinic law forbade tying any \nknots on the Sabbath; though one rabbi said it was legal to tie a knot \nthat could be untied with one hand. 10 Moslems said Mohammed nearly \ndied of a sickness prepared by Jewish witches with a "cord of knots," \nwhich was discovered in time to save his life. The knots were loosened \nby speaking verses of the Koran. Moslems still believe that Surah \nCXIII of the Koran will stop "the evil of women who are blowers on \nknots." 11 \n\nKnot magic is performed by the Mexican recibidora (midwife) in \n\n\n\n512 \n\n\n\ncomplicated tyings of umbilical cords. 12 Greeks still remember the Kobolds \n\nlife-knots of the Moerae, saying of a dead man, "his thread is cut." ,J Koran \n\nThe same triple Fates govern the "Nordic Knot" of three interlock- ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ning triangles, known as the Knot of the Vala. 14 Formed of three \nfemale-genital symbols, this invoked the Great Vala (Freya) who \nwove the fates of men. \n\n1.

Their name descended from \nGreek kaballoi, horse-riders, which formerly referred to "Amazo- \nnian" tribes led by the Goddess. She was called Oberon\'s spouse, \nTitania, queen of the Titans who were, of course, the earth-giants \nworshipped by pre-Hellenic Pelasgian peoples, who resisted the Olym- \npian gods. 1 Similarly the kobolds lived underground, and resisted the \nrule of new celestial deities. \n\nl.deGivry, 315. \n\n\n\nKoran \n\nMohammedan scriptures, often erroneously thought to have been \n\nwritten by Mohammed. Moslems don\'t believe this. 1 But many don\'t \nI know the Koran was an enlarged, revised version of the ancient \nI Word of the Goddess Kore, revered by Mohammed\'s tribe, the \n\nKoreshites (Children of Kore), who guarded her shrine at Mecca. \nThe original writing was done long before Mohammed\'s time by \n\nholy imams, a word related to Semitic ima, "mother." 2 Like the \n(original mahatmas or "great mothers" in India, the original imams were \nIprobably priestesses of the old Arabian matriarchate. It was said they \n(took the scriptures from a prototype that existed in heaven from the \n(beginning of eternity, "Mother of the Book" i.e., the Goddess \n(herself, wearing the Book of Fate on her breast as Mother Tiamat wore \nthe Tablets of Destiny. Sometimes the celestial Koran was called the \n[(Preserved Tablet. 3 There was some resemblance between this and other \nlegendary books of divine origin, such as the Ur-text, the Book of \nIrhoth, and the Emerald Tablet of Hermes. \n\nAs in the case of the Judeo-Christian Bible, the Koran was much \nliewritten to support new patriarchal laws and to obliterate the figures \n|)f the Goddess and her priestesses. See Arabia. \n\n1. Encyc. Brit., "Mohammed." 2. Campbell, Oc.M., 443. 3. Budge, A.T., 52. \n\n\n\n513 \n\n\n\nKore \n\n\n\nNeolithic Asia knew \na mysterious Goddess \nKer, or Car, \nancestress of the \nCarians. 1 Her city in \nthe Chersonese was \nCardia, "the \nGoddess Car." Kardia \nbecame the Greek \nword for "heart," as cor \nbecame the Latin; \nboth descended from \nthe Goddess who \nwas the world-heart. \nThe same syllable is \nfound in words for \nmaternal blood \nrelationships: Gaelic \ncairdean, kinship; \nTurkish kardes, \nmaternal siblings. 2 \nThe Goddess became \nKardia ton kosmos: \n"Heart of the World." 5 \n\n\n\nKore \n\nGreek Holy Virgin, inner soul of Mother Earth (Demeter); a name \nso widespread, that it must have been one of the earliest designations of \nthe World Shakti or female spirit of the universe. Variations include \nKer, Car, Q\'re, Cara, Kher, Ceres, Core, Sanskrit Kaur or Kauri, \nalternate names for the Goddess Kali. \n\nShrines of Karnak in Egypt and Carnac in Brittany were sites of \ngigantic temples and funerary complexes over 5000 years ago, \ndedicated to Kar or Kore. France had similar shrines in similarly-named \nlocations, Kerlescan, Kercado, Kermario. 4 The last name combined \nthe pagan Virgin with the Goddess Mari, who was sometimes her \ndaughter, her mother, or herself, like Kali embodied in Kel-Mari. 5 \nInhabitants of Carnac, and of Carnuntum on the Danube, called \nthemselves in Roman times the Carnutes, "people born of the \nGoddess Car." 6 \n\nIn Egypt\'s early dynastic period there was a place called Kerma \n(Mother Ker) in Nubia, where mass sacrifices took place. A similar \nname, Kara, was held in reverence by several early Egyptian rulers. \nEgyptians spoke of an eastern land called Kher, and called Palestine \nthe country of Kharu. 7 \n\nCar or Carna was known to the Romans as "a Goddess of the \nolden time," whose archaic worship was connected with Karneia \nfestivals of Sparta and the classic Roman Carnival. 8 Sometimes she was \nCarmenta, "the Mind of Car," who invented the Roman alphabet. 9 \nAn extremely old temple on the Caelian Hill was dedicated to her. 10 A \nlater variation of her name was Ceres, origin of such words as cereal, \ncorn, kernel, core, carnal, cardiac. \n\nIn the east this ancient Goddess was everywhere. Some said she \nwas Artemis Caryatis, mother of the Caryatides of the Laconian \ntemple of Caryae. 11 The Tyrian seaport of Caraalis (modern Cagliari) \nwas sacred to her. 12 One of Israel\'s oldest shrines, the "garden" called \nMount Carmel, was her place and that of her baalim (gods). 13 \n\nKore was a great power in Coptic religion, with a flourishing cult at \nAlexandria in the 4th century a.d. Her festival, the Koreion, was held \neach January 6, later assimilated to Christianity as the feast of Epiphany. \nKore\'s festival celebrated the birth of the new year god Aeon to the \nVirgin, whose naked image was carried seven times around the temple, \ndecorated with gold stars and the sign of the cross. The priests \nannounced to the public that the Virgin had brought forth the Aeon. 14 \n\nThe Koreion passed into British tradition as the Kirn, or Feast of \nIngathering, which the church later changed to the Feast of Our \nLady of Mercy. Kirn was a cognate of the Greek kern or sacred womb- \nvase in which the grain god was reborn. 15 Here again the Kore or Ker \nwas a virgin mother. The Goddess\'s harvest instrument, a moon-sickle, \nrepresented even the Christian version of the festival. 16 \n\nThe classic myth of Kore\'s abduction by Pluto was another \n\n\n\n514 \n\n\n\ninstance of a god\'s usurpation of the Goddess\'s power, according to \nGnostic sources. "Plutonius Zeus . . . does not possess the nourishment \nfor all mortal living creatures, for it is Kore who bears the fruit." 17 \nKore\'s resurrection represented the seasonal return of vegetation. She \nwas also the World Soul animating each human soul, and looking out \nof the eyes. Reflection in the pupil of an eye was known as the Kore or \n"Maiden" in the eye. To the Arabs, it was the "baby" in the eye. \nThe Bible calls either a daughter or a soul "the apple of thine eye" \n(Proverbs 7:2); and of course, every apple had a Kore. \n\n1. Graves, W.G, 373. 2.

A girl "bore the Kula \nflower" at first menstruation, which assimilated her to the clan spirit \ndwelling in maternal bloodlines. 1 In Fiji, the same word described a \nnewly circumcised adolescent boy, whose flow of genital blood was \nsupposed to connect him to the tribe and give him fertility magic like \nthat of the kula girl. 2 \n\n1.

An aim of Tantric yoga was to "realize \nKundalini" by certain exercises and meditations, such as yoni-mudra: \ncontraction of the perineal muscles, training men to suppress ejacula- \ntion. If Kundalini could be induced to uncoil and mount through the \nspinal chakras to the brain, the adept would experience the bliss of her \nemergence as the "thousand-petaled lotus" from the top of the head, \nwhich meant union of the self with the infinite. Tibetan lamas still \nconsider the most secret, sacred mantra the one that wakens the \nsleeping Kundalini and causes her to rise. 1 \n\n1.

Worshippers of Kupala bathed themselves in rivers and \npurified their souls with the "dew of Kupala" gathered during the night \nof her festival. They would pray: "I come to thee, little water-mother, \nwith head bowed and repentant. Forgive me, pardon me and ye, too, \nancestors and forefathers of the water." Kupala was also connected \nwith the mystic Fire-flower of the fern, supposed to bloom exactly at \nmidnight once a year, on the night of the Goddess\'s festival. It was \nguarded by demons, but if someone wise and bold enough to outsmart \nthe demons managed to seize the flower, he would understand the \nlanguage of trees. 1 This was a typical shaman\'s myth of the prize of \nsecret knowledge, obtained at great risk, in the talismanic form of a \nfemale symbol. \n\n1 .

Centuries later, some accounts declared it was the sign of the \ncross that Constantine saw in the sky. The earliest descriptions \ncontradict this. The labarum was not the sign of the cross; it didn\'t \nappear in the sky; it was not even a Christian symbol. \nW% Lactantius said the emperor was "directed in a dream to cause a \n\n^^JZ^ heavenly sign to be marked on the shields of his soldiers ... the letter \n\n^^^^^ X with a perpendicular line through it, turned over at the top." This was \n\nin fact the emblem of the soldiers\' god Mithra, whose worship was \n\nmost popular in the legions. 1 Christians struggling to Christianize this \n\nLabarum sign claimed it was formed of the letters chi and rho, for Christos. \n\nHowever, a series of holy signs from Philae show that the labarum \nevolved from the Egyptian ankh. 2 \n\nPious hagiographers of the Middle Ages paid no attention to \nLactantius. They declared that Constantine saw in the sky "the \nimage of a cross described in shining light; and above the image was \nwritten in letters of gold the legend: \'In this sign shalt thou con- \nquer!\'" 3 This was the orthodox Christian myth, which survived. \n\nThere were other forms of the labarum or Chrismon (Christ- \nmonogram). Most common today is the combination of letters IHS, \noften with a cross surmounting the H. This is called a signum dei, \nsupposed to mean Iesus Hominum Salvator, "Jesus, Savior of Man." \nTaylor said the same letters had a mystic meaning in Orphic resurrec- \ntion cults, where they were not Latin but Greek letters: iota, eta, \nsigma. \n\nIHS are Greek characters, by ignorance taken for Roman letters; \nand Yes, which is the proper reading of those letters, is none other than \nthe very identical name of Bacchus, that is, of the Sun, of which Bacchus \nwas one of the most distinguished personifications; and Yes, or IES, \nwith the Latin termination US added to it, is Jesus. The surrounding rays \nof glory, as expressive of the sun \'s light, make the identity of Christ and \nBacchus as clear as the sun. * \n\nAccording to another interpretation, confusing Constantine\'s \nbiography with the Mithraic-Christian labarum, the letters meant in hoc \nsigno (in this sign), and the cross was a magical command: "Con- \nquer!" Yet another tradition confused the labarum with the \nAlpha-and-Omega cross, with the Greek letters of creation and \ndestruction on its right and left arms. 5 This was a further adaptation of \nvery ancient matriarchal symbols; for Omega was the letter of the \ndestroying Moon-goddess, and Alpha was the sacred river of her blood \nthat gave birth to all things.

When a male priesthood took \nj over the Goddess\'s shrine at Delphi, founded by Cretan "Amazons," \nj they adopted the labrys also and gave themselves the title of Labryadae, \nI "ax-bearers." The title was still used in classical times. 1 It may have \n< been based on a traditional male scepter-bearer in the Goddess\'s \nI processions in earlier centuries, perhaps even the sacred youth \nhimself, consecrated to the hieros gamos, and displaying a "phallic" \n! symbol of his imminent union and sacrifice. \n\nIn modern times the labrys has been adopted by lesbians as a \nI symbol of reminiscence, in jewelry or art, of the all-female com- \nmunity of Lesbos and its founding mothers who worshipped only the \nj Goddess in nature and in each other. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,181. \n\n\n\nLabrys \nLabyrinth \n\n\n\nLabyrinth \n\n"House of the Double Ax," from labrys, the ceremonial ax used to \nsacrifice bulls to the Cretan Moon-goddess. The classic Labyrinth was \nthe palace of Minos, "Moon-king," whose spirit dwelt in the sacred \nbull, the Minotaur or Moon-bull, a Cretan form of Apis, who was \nsimilarly sacrificed in Egypt. 1 Minos was a Lord of Death and an \nunderworld judge, a western counterpart of the Hindu Moon-bull \nYama, who functioned in the same way. 2 \n\nThe mystic meaning of a labyrinthine design was a journey into \nthe otherworld and out again, like the sacred king\'s cyclic journeys \ninto death and rebirth. Early labyrinthine designs on coins, caves, tombs, \netc. referred to the earth-womb. The classic labyrinth was not a maze \nto get lost in; it had only one path, traversing all parts of the figure. Such \nlabyrinths were meant for ceremonial walking, "almost always con- \nnected with a cave. ... In those cases where the ritual has been \npreserved, the labyrinth itself, or a drawing of it, is invariably situated \nat the entrance of the cave or dwelling." 5 \n\nLabyrinth-games were played by witches for ceremonial purposes. \nSome descended to the nursery level, like the game Troy Town still \nplayed by children on a pattern of seven labyrinthine circles cut in sod. 4 \n\nSome labyrinths were taken over by Christian churches and \nincorporated into floor patterns, gardens, or hedges. Some were \ninsinuated into church designs by masonic brotherhoods as secret \nGnostic symbols. Chartres Cathedral had a labyrinth with the six- \nlobed device of Aphrodite at its center. The path of the labyrinth was \nexactly 666 feet long, Aphrodite\'s sacred number. 5 (See Hexagram.) \nThe central lotus once bore the names of the master builders, who \n\n\n\nus \n\n\n\nLabyrinth \n\n\n\n523 \n\n\n\nLachesis \nLadder \n\n\n\nperhaps hoped to achieve immortality by the Gnostic name-magic. \nBut the names have been erased. 6 \n\n1.

The Book of the Dead said a pharaoh \nmight become Lord of the Ladder, assisted into heaven by a prayer that \nhe was taught: "Homage to thee, O divine Ladder. Homage to thee, \nO Ladder of Set! Stand thou upright, O divine Ladder. Stand thou \nupright, O Ladder of Set! Stand thou upright, O Ladder of Horus, \nwhereby Osiris appeared in heaven when he used the words of power o \nRa." 1 \n\nThe dead king\'s subjects were assured that "the gods made a ladder \nfor (him) that he might ascend to heaven on it." The king\'s funerary \ninscriptions said, "I set up a ladder to heaven among the gods." 2 \n\nThe ladder to heaven was a relic of shamanistic death-rebirth \nceremonies. It was ascended by kings, prophets, sages, bodhisattvas, anc \nother Enlightened Ones, the "angels" on the ladder in Jacob\'s dream \n(Genesis 28:12). Among central Asian tribes the "soul ladder" was a \npost fixed on the grave, with fourteen notches representing the "steps" \nor days of the moon in ascent. A similar Heavenly Ladder was made in ! \nIndia with wooden sword blades, which the priest must climb to perforrj \nsacramental decapitation of a white cock at the top. Chinese shamans ol \nhigh priests ascended a ladder of knives, walking barefoot on the edges \nas an initiatory ordeal. 3 \n\nPriest-kings in antiquity climbed soul-ladders to meet the Goddess) \n\n\n\n524 \n\n\n\nj&T: \n\n\n\nbn the occasion of their hieros gamos and also after death, when their \nfcouls returned to the Mother who bore them. Sometimes the ladder was \nberceived as a familiar passageway between the Goddess in heaven and \nper consort the king on earth. Kosingas of Thrace controlled his subjects \npy threatening to ascend his special wooden ladder to the Great \nGoddess Hera, to complain to her of their conduct and invoke her \nLvrath on them. 4 \n\nAs a rule the soul-ladder passed through the seven heavens, like \nme axis rnundi in Gnostic cosmology. Celsus said initiates into the \nMithraic Mysteries climbed a klimaxox ladder of seven rungs. 5 The first \n[ung was lead for Saturn, the second tin for Venus, the third bronze for \nlupiter, the fourth iron for Mercury, the fifth "monetary alloy" for \nMars, the sixth silver for the moon, and the seventh gold for the sun. At \nthe top, a platform represented the sphere of the fixed stars, the \nEmpyrean. 6 \n\nAs a symbol of ecstatic initiatory ascents in the sacred Mysteries, \n[he ladder was carried over into Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. \nMohammed\'s vision like Jacob\'s was "a ladder rising from the temple in \nJerusalem (pre-eminently the \'Center\') to heaven, with angels to right \npnd left; on this ladder the souls of the righteous mounted to God." 7 \nBoth Jacob\'s ladder and Mohammed\'s were based on much earlier \nEgyptian representations of the pharaoh being welcomed into heaven \nby the gods, who helped him up the last rungs of his ascent. 8 Like the \nladders of Set, Osiris, and Buddha, the ladder of the pharaoh had 14 \n[tteps, alluding to the waxing days of the lunar cycle. Another 14 steps \n[represented the descending part of the cycle, into the underworld and \nIpack. \n\nThere were many "ladder-saints" in Syria and Persia during the \nffth century a.d., when ladder-sitting or pillar-sitting became a fad \n[among holy hermits. St. Simeon Stylites was a famous Christian pillar- \nlaint, glorified for remaining motionless so long that his living limbs \nDeveloped gangrene. One of his followers and admirers was named St. \nBadoth (Persian Schiadurte). The legend of this saint said he saw a \ni\'ision of Simeon at the top of heaven-reaching ladder, calling down to \nliim, "Mount up, Sadoth; fear not! I mounted yesterday; it is your turn \n|oday." Shortly afterward, Sadoth was martyred and climbed up to \n|ieaven. 10 \n\nThe sacred klimax was so popular in Byzantine and Gnostic \nconography that it was even canonized as a bogus saint, John Clima- \nus. A mystical book supposed to have been written by him appeared at \nVlt. Sinai in the 7th century a.d., the Ladder to Paradise." This St. \nohn was said to have been an abbot at the Sinai monastery, but his \nurname suggested a Tantric adept. The klimax was more than a ladder; \nis its modern usage suggests, it was also an ascent to sexual bliss through \nnarriage with the Goddess. Some Gnostic sects were still using the \nadder as a symbol of the soul\'s marriage in the Middle Ages. \n\\.B<x>k<>ftheDead,lO\\. 2. Eliade, S., 489. 3.

Throughout the Middle Ages, orthodox theology insisted that \n\n\n\n526 \n\n\n\nAdam was buried on Golgotha at the exact spot where Jesus\'s cross Lamhussu \n\nstood, so the blood of the Lamb-savior ran down into the earth and Lammas \n\nbrought salvation to Adam\'s remains. 1 Eve was not buried there, \nhowever; theologians said nothing whatever about her salvation. \n\nThe medieval name of Agnus Dei was given to cakes of wax \nstamped with the figure of a lamb and sold by the papacy, which \npreserved an exclusive monopoly on their sale by a papal bull of 1471. \nThis charm was in great demand, as it was advertised as sure \nprotection against all kinds of destructive storms the "acts of God" as \ndefined by theologians. 2 In effect, the power of the Son was invoked \nto protect humanity against the wrath of his Father. \n\nl.Eliade,S.,268. 2.

Lammas was \nthe "Eve" of this month of ripening, often classified with May Eve and \n\nr Halloween as a festival of witches, because the church didn\'t succeed \neradicating its pagan significance. 1 Sometimes Lammas was identified \n\n\n\nimmas \n\n\n\n527 \n\n\n\nLancelot with the Celtic midsummer festival of Lugnasad, celebrating the \n\ndeath and resurrection of Lug as grain god. Churchmen said Lammas \n\nmmaammmmmmmm^mm was one or " me witches\' four annual Great Sabbaths, based on the \nfour seasonal festivals of the pagan year. \n\n1. Brewster, 349. \n\n\n\nLancelot \n\nArthurian hero based on early Celtic conceptions of the phallic \nlightning god Lanceor, the Golden Lance, mated to Colombe, the \nDove, a northern version of Aphrodite Columba. 1 Like the Oriental \nvajra, meaning phallus, jewel, or lightning, Lanceor descended into the \nGoddess\'s abyssal womb to fertilize the world. Thus Plutarch stated \nthat Lightning was the impregnator of the Waters. 2 \n\nThough anthropomorphized in romance as a knight of the Round \nTable, Lancelot showed signs of his pagan origin: he was still the \nlover of the Mother, and the reincarnation of his own elder self. He lay \nwith Elaine, or Elen, or Helen, or Eileen, or Hel-Aine, the same \nGoddess worshipped at the Celtic lunar shrine of Cnoc Aine. 3 She was \nthe Weaver of Fate, and she made Lancelot invincible with her gift \nof a vaginal fetish, a red silk sleeve. She was also Lancelot\'s queen \nmother Elaine, who christened him Galahad, the same name given \nhis younger reincarnation or "son." The elder hero received the name \nLancelot when he was initiated by the Lady of the Lake in her magic \nLand of Women. 4 \n\nLike Osiris-Horus, Apollo-Heracles, Zeus-Zagreus, God-Jesus, \nand other versions of the ubiquitous father-son deity, Lancelot \nbecame a Lord of Death and a keeper of the paradise-castle, which \nappeared in the romances as Joyous Gard, the "Happy World." \nLancelot stole Arthur\'s queen, living symbol of the land of Britain, after \nrescuing her from a fiery death at the stake, on a conviction of \nwitchcraft. It was she who announced that Lancelot came from Jesus \nChrist in the 8th generation, while Galahad was of the 9th genera- \ntion. 5 Though medieval churchmen insisted that Jesus never begot \nchildren, the heathen bards continued to popularize the contrary \nbelief because it was the best way to account for the old concept of \nsuccessive reincarnations. \n\nLike many other figures of Celtic romance, Lancelot seems to \nhave developed out of Oriental Tantric traditions. He resembled the \nTantric saint Padma-sambhava, the Lake-Born Vajra, i.e., a phallic \nlightning-bolt reborn from the Water-Mother as Lady of the Lake. 6 \nThe Dove of the Sea was his mother-bride, symbol of the Abyss \n(Maria). Lancelot\'s name, "Big Lance," might be compared to the \nother primitive Tantric-Celtic hero Peredur Paladrhir, "Spearman with \na Long Shaft," which described the ithyphallic god in union with his \nGoddess. 7 \n\n\n\n528 \n\n\n\nLancelot\'s origin in Meidelant, "Land of Maidens," also suggests Lapis Manalis \n\nan early date and an Oriental root of his basic myth. 8 He suggested Lat \n\nKrishna who was raised by "holy women" in a sacred grove, and grew ^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\nup to be an eminently sexual god. 9 Lancelot was not a solar deity but \nthe rival of the sun god, represented by Gawain, with whom Lancelot \nfought a great battle, defeating him when his strength ebbed at the \nend of the solar day. \n\n1.

At the annual festival of \nMania, the Ancestral Moon-mother, the stone was removed and her \nchildren the manes or ghosts-of-ancestors were invited to join the feast. \nSometimes the festival was called Parentalia, since the ghosts in the \nunderworld were the same as the diparentes or "parent-gods" from past \nages. 1 \n\nNorthern Europeans celebrated the same kind of festival at Hal- \nloween or Samhain, also a feast to which ancestral ghosts were \ninvited. \n\n1. Lamusse, 213. \n\n\n\nLara \n\nShort name of the Roman Goddess Acca Larentia, mother of the \nlares or household spirits. She was honored at the annual Larentalia, a \nfestival inherited from pre-Roman times. See Akka. \n\n\n\nLat \n\nItalian latte, "milk," descended from the milk-giving Goddess Lat, \neponymous Mother of pre-Roman Latium. She was also Latona, or \nLeto, mother of the World Egg and the sun. 1 Arabs knew her as Al- \nLat, the Moon, later masculinized as the Islamic Allah. She was well \nknown in pre-dynastic Egypt. Herodotus called her "an archaic \nqueen of the Lower Kingdom." Hers was one of Egypt\'s oldest oracular \nshrines, which the Greeks knew as Latopolis. 2 To the Egyptians, this \nplace was Menhet, "House of the Moon." 5 \n\nLat was the Moon because the ancient world regarded the moon \nthe universal source of nourishment: a celestial Breast that pro- \nduced the Milky Way. From the moon came water, milk, blood, plant \nsap, and all other life-supporting fluids. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n529 \n\n\n\nLeda Lat was the foundress of Latin matriarchal culture. The old word \n\nLeft Hand latifundia meant parcels of land allotted to clan matriarchs by the \n\n^^^^^i^^ Goddess herself. 4 See Matrilineal Inheritance. The island of Malta \n\nwas once Ma Lata, "Mother Lat." \n\nIn 1428, the church totally destroyed an Italian town whose \n\nresidents were suspected of heretical opinions. Oddly enough, the \n\ntown was named Magnalata: "Great Lat." \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 318. 2. Larousse, 29. 3. Budge, G.E. 2, 50. \n4. Cumont, M.M., 74. \n\n\n\nLeda \n\n"Lady" or "Woman," another name of the Goddess Lat, who laid \nthe World Egg and hatched Castor and Pollux, the morning and \nevening stars; and Helen, the earthly incarnation of the Moon- \ngoddess; and Clytemnestra, who was to Mycenae as Helen was to Troy. \nMythographers confused Leda with Nemesis, who coupled with \nZeus when he took the form of a swan-king. Thus she became the \nfamous Goose that Laid the Golden Egg (the sun, Apollo) under her \nother name, Leto. 1 To the Egyptians, this was the Nile Goose, Hathor. \nA favorite theme of medieval artists was the coupling of Leda with \nthe swan-god, which permitted an erotic subject to be shown without \ninvolvement of a human male figure. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,207. \n\n\n\nLeft Hand \n\nLatin sinister, "left," came to mean diabolic, witchlike; dexter, \n"right," yielded dextrous, meaning skilful or clever. Ambidextrous is \nliterally "two right hands." Right-ness is associated with righteous- \nness, rectitude, rectification, good right hand, adroitness (from French a \ndroite, "to the right"). Left is gauche, clumsy or stupid, with its \nEnglish derivatives gawk, gawky. Italian mancino, "left," means deceit- \nful. German link, "left," means wrong, backward, perverse. \nAnglo-Saxon lyft meant weak or worthless. The evil eye was said to be \nthe left one. 1 According to the Brahmans, left-handedness goes \nagainst the grain of decency. 2 Jewish mystics said God\'s left hand is the \nhand that destroys. Satanael or Sammael the death-god personifies \nGod\'s left side. 3 The Gospel of Nicodemus said the thief crucified at \nJesus\'s right hand received the kingdom of heaven; the thief crucified \nat his left hand was damned. 4 Superstitious folk still believe it\'s lucky to \nsee the new moon over one\'s right shoulder but disastrous to see it \nover the left. 5 \n\nSagan asks, "In the worldwide associations of the words \'right\' and \n\'left\' there is evidence of a rancorous conflict early in the history of \nmankind. What could arouse such powerful emotions?" 6 \n\n\n\n530 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else, indeed, but patriarchs\' battle of the sexes? \n\nAll myths agree that the right side was male, the left side female. \nWherever the deity was an androgyne, this arrangement was fol- \nowed. Typical was the Hindu bisexual deity Bhava, "Existence," with a \nwoman\'s left side and a man\'s right, signifying "man together with \nMature" and showing that all Existence is made up of two sexes. \n\\ndrogynous idols of Kali and Shiva showed the same arrangement. 7 \n\nGreek Pelopids tattooed themselves with a female symbol on the \nleft shoulder in honor of maternal ancestry, a male symbol on \nthe right shoulder for paternal ancestors. Egyptians said the left hand \n^represented the Goddess Maat, the right hand her consort Thoth. \nBabylonians prayed: "Let my goddess stand at my left hand! Let my god \nistand at my right hand!" 8 \n\nThe Jews said the seed of female children emanated from a father\'s \nleft testicle, while that of male children emanated from his right \ntesticle. 9 This ancient belief persisted among Christians even up to the \npresent century. In 1891 a book entitled Essentials of Conception \nsaid a man could "progenate a male or female child at will, by putting \nan elastic band around the testicle not required. Semen from the right \ntesticle progenates male, whilst that from the left female children." 10 \n\nAccording to some rabbinical traditions, the left hand of God was \n1 {female, which may have been why patriarchs thought it necessary not \n|to let "thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth" (Matthew 6:3). \nRabbis taught that "A wise man\'s heart is at his right hand: but a \n(fool\'s heart is at his left" (Ecclesiastes 10:2). Matriarchal societies \nbelieved the menstrual blood that made a child in a mother\'s womb \nwas her heart\'s blood, engendered on the left side of the body; but the \npatriarchs displaced the heart to the right. \n\nIn a sense, modern research has found some physical basis for \npelief in the left/female, right/male imagery of the ancients. The left \nhemisphere of the brain, which controls the right side of the body, is said \nto evolve logical thought sequences and suppress sensory input that \nmight interfere with problem solving. The right hemisphere, governing \nthe left side of the body, is called the intuitive, creative, or imaginative \npart of the brain. It is supposed to generate the more sensitive, broader \nawareness and response made manifest in feelings, empathy, fantasy, \nart, visual imagery, and inspiration: many of its qualities were belittled by \npatriarchal thinkers as incomprehensible "women\'s intuition." n This \nis an over-simplification, since both hemispheres work together in both \nfexes, and their functions are not neatly divisible. One half of a brain \ncould hardly exist without the other. \n\nIndia prized intuitive thinking somewhat more than logical think- \ning, and recognized two Ways to religious revelation: the male, solar, \nascetic "way to the gods" known as the Right-Hand Path; and the \nfemale, lunar, sensual way of the Goddess, known as Varna Marg or \nthe Left-Hand Path literally, the Female Way. 12 Tantric yogis recog- \nnized the left side of the body as the seat of every man\'s "female \nsoul" or shakti, with whom he would be united after death. In token of \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft Hand \n\n\n\nPelopids Tribes \nclaiming descent from \nPelops, a legendary \nsacred king sacrificed, \npartly devoured, and \nresurrected by Mother \nDemeter; inhabitants \nof the Peloponnese. \n\n\n\n531 \n\n\n\nLeft Hand reverence for the indwelling female soul, the yogis always entered a \n\nplace of worship with the left foot forward. 13 \nmm ^^^ mm ^^^^ m Europe\'s pagan customs, embodied in "witchcraft," maintained \n\nthe virtues of left-sidedness against prevailing patriarchal opinion. \nWitches said itching or burning of the left ear betokened joy in the near \nfuture, while the same sensations of the right ear meant sorrow. 14 \nWitches\' dances circled to the left, counterclockwise, moonwise, or \n"widdershins" as folk dances still do following the retrograde \nmotion of the moon instead of the clockwise motion of the sun. The \nmedieval church said dancing, turning, or circumambulating in this \ndirection was heresy. During the centuries of persecution, countless \npeople were burned alive for dancing widdershins, especially if they \nturned their backs to the center of the circle. Back-to-back dancing was \nevidently considered indecent, though widely practiced. 15 \n\nThe pagans were firmly in favor of the widdershins direction. Pre- \nChristian kings in Scandinavia were expected to lay magic circles of \nprotection around their cities by circumambulating them widdershins. \nIrish druidic law insisted on the same counterclockwise movement \naround the holy omphalos at Tara, shrine of Mother Earth: "Thou shalt \nnot go righthandwise around Tara." 16 Tantric influence also directed \nMiddle-Eastern Sufis to circumambulate their shrines in the widder- \nshins direction. 17 \n\nThe Christians reversed the direction of all turning charms, such \nas the divinatory magic of St. Andrew\'s Well on the isle of Lewis. \nSick pilgrims were told to float a wooden bowl on the waters. If the bowl \nturned sunwise, the patient understood that he would get well. If it \nturned moonwise, he would die. 18 \n\nWitches were said to make the sign of the cross with their left \nhands: another proof of heresy. The left-handed cross in graphic \nsymbolism was the Oriental moon-swastika, with arms pointing counter- \nclockwise, an emblem of Kali, as opposed to the sun-swastika, which \nrepresented male gods. 19 See Swastika. \n\nThe Scottish rite of handfasting was derived from a pagan-Oriental \nmarriage custom, incorporating the figure-eight Infinity sign that \nrepresented union of Kali and Shiva among Tantric yogis and yoginis. \nThe couple joined right hands to unite their "male" souls, then \njoined left hands to unite their "female" souls, forming the Infinity sign \nwith their arms thus crossed. 20 The sign itself is still used in modern \nmathematics, but handshakes are now exclusively and significantly \nright-handed. \n\nAnother Tantric sign of male-and-female unity was pressing the \npalms of the hands together, fingers upward: this meant two bodies \njoined as one. The gesture is still one of greeting and blessing among \nIndians. During the 12th and 13th centuries when Hindu religious \ncustoms were penetrating Europe, the gesture was adopted by Catharan \nheretics as the manibus junctis (hand-joining), which the orthodox \nchurch later took to itself. 21 Now it is the standard gesture of prayer, \nboth east and west. \n\n\n\n532 \n\n\n\nClassic traditions added still more support to the male-female \nimages of rightness and leftness. While giving birth to the sun and moon \n(Apollo and Artemis), the Goddess Leto grasped a male palm tree \nwith her right hand and a female olive tree with her left. 22 When giving \nbirth to Zeus, the Goddess Rhea placed her hands on the earth to \ncause five female spirits to spring up from her left handprint, and five \nmale spirits from her right handprint (see Fingers). The matriarchal \nmagic of Medusa was mythically symbolized: blood from her left side \ncould give rebirth to the dead; blood from her right side instantly \ndestroyed a human body. 25 The Romans still believed in the benevo- \nlence of the left side. Plutarch said it was a good omen to see an \naugury, such as a flying eagle, on one\'s left side; an evil omen to see it \non the right. 24 \n\nMen placed wedding rings on women\'s left hands to fetter their \nmagic power and hold their hearts. From the most ancient times, \nmen believed that a certain vessel or vein ran directly from a woman\'s \nheart to the fourth finger of her left hand. This was a remarkably \ndurable belief; Lemnius mentioned it as late as 1658. 25 \n\nAccording to heraldic symbolism, the bend sinister, a stripe slant- \ning to the left, signified bastardy or lack of a father. A warrior bearing \nthe bend sinister on his shield was therefore his mother\'s son only, after \nthe fashion of the heathen matrilineal clan. Fatherlessness was not \nconsidered a mark of dishonor until Christianity had established the \npatriarchal family system throughout Europe. \n\nRelated to the symbolism of the left and right hands was the \nsymbolism of east and west. Rome established the four cardinal points \nby a north-south line and an east-west line, decumanus. The eastern \nhalf was familiaris, the area of good omens and of the sun. The \nwestern half was hostilis, the area of evil omens and of the moon. 26 \nSince it was the custom to face the "still point" of the heavens the \nnorth celestial pole for orientation of buildings and towns, the left \nhand was to the west, the right hand to the east, as maps are still \nmade. To the west lay the Moon-land, home of the ancestral dead, \ncalled Westerners by the Chinese, Greeks, Celts, and Egyptians. 27 As \nlong ago as the Stone Age, the dead were buried facing west. "To go \nwest" has always been a synonym for "to die." Death meant a \njourney to the western gate of the Mother. Aztecs called the west "the \nplace of women," where human beings once crawled out of the \ngenital hole of Mother Earth, to which all the dead must return. 28 \n\nOn the other hand literally the east was the place of male solar \ngods greeted every morning with the formula, "He is risen." The \neastern sun-temple of Borsippa was known as the Temple of the Right \nHand. 29 The main avenue of Alexandria ran from the Gate of the \nSun on the east to the Gate of the Moon on the west. 30 The eastern abt \nof an Egyptian temple was the birthplace of the sun god Ra; the west \nwas the place of his dying. 31 This was probably the origin of the eastern \napse in a Christian church, which like the Egyptian abt was "orient- \ned" toward the east, birthplace of the sun. \n\n\n\nLeft Hand \n\n\n\nBorsippa Ancient \nsister city of Babylon, \nlocated about 1 5 \nmiles to the southwest; \nnow known as Birs \nNimrud. Borsippa \nflourished greatly in \nthe 7th and 6th \ncenturies B.C. It was \ndestroyed by Xerxes I in \nthe 5th, and partly \nrestored by Antiochus I \nin the 3rd. \n\n\n\n533 \n\n\n\nLegba \nLemnos \n\n\n\nBruce Papyrus Second- \ncentury Gnostic \nmanuscript \ndiscovered at Nag \nHammadi in Upper \nEgypt during the 1940s. \n\n\n\nArchons Gnostic \nterm for good or evil \nangels, especially as \nworld-creating or world- \ngoverning spirits who \ncontrolled the \nphenomena of the \nstars, heavens, weather, \netc. \n\n\n\nJohnHuss(ca. 1370- \n1415) Bohemian \nreligious reformer, \nfounder of the Hussite \nsect which \nrenounced papal \nindulgences and the \ndoctrine of \ntransubstantiation. \nHuss was promised a \nsafe-conduct to \ndefend his views before \na church council, but \nthe promise was broken; \nhe was declared \nheretic, arrested, and \nburned. \n\n\n\nChristians taught that the west was the natural home of "demons." \nThe Bruce Papyrus depicted Jesus revealing to his disciples the magic \nwords that would make evil Archons "flee away to the West, to the Left \nHand." 32 When the Greek church baptized converts, "they first \nturned their faces to the west, and so renounced the devil, and then to \nthe east, and made their covenant with Christ."" When John Huss \nwas burned for heresy at Constance in 141 5, he was at first bound to th< \nstake facing east; but the error was noticed in time, and he was shifted \nto face west, the direction "fitting for a heretic." 54 \n\nSuperstition still maintains the male-and-female symbolism of east \nand west. The bad luck caused by spilling salt (symbol of blood) can \nbe averted by throwing the salt over the left shoulder, toward the west, \nrelegating the bad luck to the devils. 35 \n\nGypsies believed they could keep a horse from straying by marking \nthe right fore hoof with a male cross, the left fore hoof with a female \nring. 36 The idea was that the sexual symbols would attract one another \nand tangle the horse\'s feet like a hobble. \n\nIt is still customary for rulers to hold the "phallic" scepter in the \nright hand, the "yonic" orb in the left. This usage descended from \nthe king\'s symbolic display of the hieros gamos between himself and \nthe Goddess of his land. The original meaning was that the ruler \nunited male and female principles; but the meaning was lost, and only \nthe symbols remained. \n\nI. Elworthy, 138. 2. O\'Flaherty, 147. 3.

Her work didn\'t survive \nthe book-burnings of the early Christian era. She was one of the first \nclassic authors to be attacked because of her homosexual orientation \nand her devotion to the Goddess. By the 8th century a.d., nothing \nsurvived of her large corpus of poetry except a few fragments quoted \nby other authors. 2 \n\nFemale homosexuality was generally regarded as a virtually \n\n\n\n\n\n\n535 \n\n\n\nLethe unthinkable threat in patriarchal societies. Christian Europe regarded \n\nLeto lesbianism as "a crime without a name," and sometimes burned \n\n^ a ^ B ^ H ^ a ^ HH ^ HI lesbians alive without trial. To this day, female homosexuals are credited \nwith fearful powers; Frank Caprio said "Lesbianism is capable of \ninfluencing the stability of our social structure." 3 Any phallocentric \nsociety would naturally so regard women indifferent to a phallus. \n\n1.

According to Orphics and other \nmystery-cultists, the spring of Lethe under a white cypress was the \nfirst thing to be seen in the underworld by a newly dead soul; and the \nsoul would be made very thirsty, and would be tempted to drink. Part \nof the mystery-cultists\' training was to learn endurance of thirst, for a \ndraught of Lethe would wipe out their memories of their previous \nincarnations and leave them no wiser than the rest of humanity, always \nborn again without remembering previous births. The enlightened \none should seek instead the spring of Memory (Mnemosyne). "Thou \nshalt find to the left of the house of Hades a spring, and by the side \nthereof standing a white cypress. To this spring approach not near. But \nthou shalt find another, from the lake of Memory cold water flowing \nforth, and there are guardians before it." l \n\nThe location of Lethe in the underworld, in classical and Gnostic \nimagery, derived from the ancient oracular cave of the Earth-deities \n(Chthonioi) at Lebadeia, where one made elaborate preparations to go \ndown into the dark pit and learn his fate through "things seen" or \n"things heard." Among the preparations, "he has to drink the water \ncalled Lethe, in order to achieve forgetfulness of all that he has \nhitherto thought of; and on top of it another water, the water of \nMnemosyne, which gives him remembrance of what he sees when \nhe has gone down." 2 \n\nClassical writers made Lethe one of the principal rivers of the \nunderworld, along with Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Styx. 3 \n\n1.

She not only held the scales of \nevery man\'s fate; she also had the All-Seeing Eye. See Tanit. \n\n1. Lumusst, 84. 2.

Most pagan thinkers said the bes \ndeath was mystically connected with love. Ovid wrote that he wanted \nto die "in the act of coming to Venus." * Heavenly "bliss" was often \nconfused with orgasm. \n\n1.

Her name was \nessentially the same as Eve\'s title, "Mother of All Living" (Genesis \n3:20). Lif \'s consort was a subordinate male, Lifthrasir, "Desirer-of- \nLife." \' The names indicated a belief that Lif would be the true parent of \nthe new creation, whereas her mate\'s only purpose was to fertilize her, as \nin the oldest known versions of the Adam and Eve myth. \n1. H.R.E. Davidson, G.M.V.A., 234. \n\n\n\nLightning \n\nHeavenly-father gods of most Indo-European religions impregnated \nMother Earth, or the sea-womb, with phallic lightning bolts. India\'s \nDyaus Pitar, "Father Heaven," wielded the lightning in token of his \nunion with the Goddess; he foreshadowed Greece\'s Zeus Pater and \nRome\'s Jupiter, who did the same. Dumuzi, Dionysus, Leviathan, \nand many other versions of the "fiery serpent" including Lucifer and \nSatan figures, were identified with the descending phallus of Heaven, \nwhom Jesus claimed to have seen "fall as lightning" (Luke 10:18). \n\n\n\n538 \n\n\n\nThe lightning god\'s "fall" was not originally a defeat in a celestial Lightning \n\nbattle but rather a descent into the womb of the Abyss to fertilize the \n\nworld. Plutarch said lightning was the impregnator of the Great God- ^^^ mgm ^^^^^^ \n\ndess of the Waters (Maria), and their union was "the cause of vital \nheat." \' \n\nLightning was the cosmic phallus of the Vedic fire god Agni, \nmated to Kali as the Primordial Abyss. She was said to "quench a \nblazing lingam in her yoni." 2 Through ignorance of its sexual meaning, \nChristians inadvertently preserved the same image of Maria-the- \nWaters rendered fertile by male fire from heaven. The baptismal font of \na Christian church was likened to the womb of Mary, as the ancient \ntemples\' water-cauldrons called "seas" or "abysses" were likened to the \nGoddess\'s womb (see Cauldron). At the consecration of a Christian \nfont, the burning paschal candle was quenched in the water like Agni\'s \nlingam, with the words, "May a heavenly offspring, conceived in \nholiness and reborn into a new creation, come forth from the stainless \nwomb of this divine font." Mary was said to be igne sacro inBam- \nmata: fecundated by the sacred fire. 3 \n\nThis universal notion of the male-female connotations of fire and \nwater was based on the Tantric view of the water element as Shakti, \nthe primal liquid power that produced "all fiery elements" i.e., male \ndeities and their symbols, the sun, fire, lightning. 4 The Jewel in the \nLotus, primary Tantric image of maleness enclosed by femaleness, \noften used for the male element the word vajra, meaning jewel, \nphallus, and lightning. 5 \n\nThe same combination of meanings occurred in Latin Gemma \nCerauniae, lightning literally the Jewel of Ceraunus, the lightning \ngod. 6 Sometimes the "jewel" was a phallic scepter like the Tantric dorje, \n"lightning-bolt" or "thunderbolt," also a phallus. The same word \ndescribed a phallic scepter made by Hephaestus, forger of lightning bolts \nfor Father Zeus; it was called doru, a spear. 7 The Indian city of \nDarjeeling was named for the dorje-lingam, "lightning-phallus." 8 \n\nA lightning-phallus or lightning-scepter was the emblem of sover- \neignty for Greek and Roman heavenly fathers and for their \nson-reincarnations also. Dionysus, born of the Earth- or Moon-mother, \nbecame "king of all the gods of the world" when he sat on his father\'s \nthrone and wielded the lightning-scepter. 9 His father Zeus descended \ninto the "bridal chambers" of the Mother Goddesses on the Acropo- \nlis at Thebes in the form of lightning; therefore, these shrines were \ntaboo and were called Places of Coming. 10 The sky-god also "came" \nas lightning to fertilize the maternal rock, Petra Genetrix, that gave birth \nto the Persian savior Mithra. 11 \n\nA descent of lightning marked many miraculous impregnations \nand virgin births throughout mythology, possibly beginning with the \nAssyro-Babylonian Zeus, called Zu the Storm Bird. Zu was a model for \nthe winged lightning-spirits the Bible called seraphim, or fiery flying \nserpents. As a Son of God, Zu coveted the Tablets of the Law, wishing \nto rule the oracles and make himself king of heaven. 12 He was \n\n\n\n539 \n\n\n\nLightning \n\n\n\nSalmoneus of Elis \n\nLegendary sacred king \nbearing the Greek \nversion of the same \nname as \nShalmaneser or \nSolomon. Elis was an \nancient city and state in \nthe northwest corner \nof the Peloponnese; \nnow called Ilia. \n\n\n\npunished for his hubris in the Babylonian myth, but as the Olympian \nZeus he successfully defeated older heaven-gods like Uranus, Cro- \nnus, Prometheus, and Hephaestus, and successfully defended his throne \nagainst other challengers. \n\nKing Salmoneus of Elis dared impersonate Zeus the Lightning, \nseeking to become the beloved of the Goddess Salma (Salome) and \ncontrol the weather. He dragged brazen cauldrons behind his chariot to \nimitate thunder, and threw torches into the air to encourage light- \nning. Zeus destroyed him for his hubris. 13 So the later mythographers \nsaid; in fact the sacred kings everywhere were made to become God, \nor the Son of God, by such magical means before they were sacrificed \nto the same God. \n\nA Dipylon amphora from the bank of the Ilissos shows a king \nwielding the scepter from which issues a lightning bolt. The figure\'s \nerect penis also shoots a bolt of lightning toward the Delta-symbol of the \nGoddess on an altar. 14 This was a typical image of the god-king, from \nnorthern Europe to central Asia where chieftains impersonated the \nlightning god to mate with the divine swan-Valkyrie Kara, a variant of \nKali or Kauri. 15 Among the Celts, the Goddess\'s bird form was Co- \nlombe, the Dove, bride of Lanceor the "Golden Lance," a lightning \ngod who evolved into Lancelot. 16 \n\nA phallic lightning bolt was the original symbol of the Ugaritic sage \nAtyn, Eytan, or Etana, whom the Bible calls Ethan, a king almost as \nwise as Solomon (1 Kings 4:3 1). He tried to ascend to Mother Ishtar in \nheaven and was cast down like a bolt of lightning by the jealous sun \ngod Shamash. His Hebrew name meant either "perpetual stream" or \n"perpetually firm," both hopeful epithets of the phallic god. Ethan, \nor Eytan, was the answer to the riddle in Proverbs 30: "Who hath \nascended up into heaven, and come down?" 17 His totem was the \neagle, symbol of lightning, fire, and the sun. He ascended spread-eagled \non the bird\'s back in the form of a cross, his fingers "upon the \nfeathers of the wings" like the Greeks\' Ganymede and the Hindus\' \nGaruda. 18 \n\nQuarrels over possession of the lightning-phallus underlay many \nstories about god-kings and their rivals. Like God casting down \nLucifer "as lightning," Zeus cast down the older lightning-deity He- \nphaestus because he defended his Great Mother Hera against a \npatriarchal attack. As a god of the conquered matriarchate, Hephaestus \nwas imprisoned in a fire-mountain and set to forging lightning bolts \nfor the new ruler, Zeus. As the archaic Cretan Velchanos, Etruscan \nVulcan, Hephaestus was one of the Amazonian smith gods who \nopposed the Olympian patriarchy. 19 \n\nThe God of Moses copied the ways of other patriarchal deities and \nclaimed the ability to "cast forth lightning" (Psalms 144:6). In a literal \nanthropomorphization this meant he could cast forth the lightning god \nLucifer from heaven. Medieval theologians were never quite sure \nwho threw the lightning bolts God, or his rival Lucifer, who retained \nthe title of Prince of the Power of the Air. \n\n\n\n540 \n\n\n\nGerman bishops said in 1783 that despite allegedly infallible With \n\nprotections such as processions, hymns, and holy relics, the devil\'s \n\nlightning damaged 400 church towers and killed 1 20 bell-ringers within ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n33 years. 20 It was difficult to explain why God so often threw \nlightning at his own churches; or, if the destructive bolts were thrown by \nthe devil, why God didn\'t protect his churches better. Effective \nmeasures had to wait until the arch-infidel Benjamin Franklin invented \nthe lightning rod. Even then, many churchmen refused to use the \nnew invention on the ground that it was one of the devil\'s artifacts. \n\nWith the decline of the devil, the damage inflicted by lightning has \nbeen once more imputed to God. Modern legal documents still \ndescribe lightning-strikes as "acts of God." \n\n1. Knight, S.L., 135. 2. Rawson, E.A., 57. 3. Neumann, CM., 31 1-12. \n\n4. Mahanirvunatmitra, cxviii. 5.

Lilit \n\ni\\dam\'s first wife was a relic of an early rabbinical attempt to assimilate \nhe Sumero-Babylonian Goddess Belit-ili, or Belili, to Jewish myth- \nalogy. To the Canaanites, Lilith was Baalat, the "Divine Lady." On a \nablet from Ur, ca. 2000 B.C., she was addressed as Lillake. 1 \n\nHebraic tradition said Adam married Lilith because he grew tired \naf coupling with beasts, a common custom of Middle-Eastern herds- \nmen, though the Old Testament declared it a sin (Deuteronomy \n27:21). Adam tried to force Lilith to lie beneath him in the "missionary \nDosition" favored by male-dominant societies. Moslems were so insis- \nent on the male-superior sexual position that they said, "Accursed be \nthe man who maketh woman heaven and himself earth." 2 Catholic \nauthorities said any sexual position other than the male-superior one is \nsinful. 3 But Lilith was neither a Moslem nor a Catholic. She sneered at \nAdam\'s sexual crudity, cursed him, and flew away to make her home by \nthe Red Sea. \n\nGod sent angels to fetch Lilith back, but she cursed them too, \nignored God\'s command, and spent her time coupling with "demons" \n(whose lovemaking evidently pleased her better) and giving birth to a \nhundred children every day. So God had to produce Eve as Lilith\'s \nmore docile replacement. \n\nLilith\'s fecundity and sexual preferences show that she was a Great \nMother of settled agricultural tribes, who resisted the invasions of \nnomadic herdsmen, represented by Adam. Early Hebrews disliked the \nGreat Mother who drank the blood of Abel the herdsman, after his \nslaying by the elder god of agriculture and smithcraft, Cain (Genesis \n4:1 1). Lilith\'s Red Sea was another version of Kali Ma\'s Ocean of \n\n\n\n541 \n\n\n\nLily Blood, which gave birth to all things but needed periodic sacrificial \n\nreplenishment. \n\n^mhmm^mmhh^m There may have been a connection between Lilith and the \n\nEtruscan divinity Leinth, who had no face and who waited at the gate \nof the underworld along with Eita and Persipnei (Hades and Persepho- \nne) to receive the souls of the dead. 4 The underworld gate was a \nyoni, and also a lily, which had "no face." Admission into the under- \nworld was often mythologized as a sexual union. The lily or lilu \n(lotus) was the Great Mother\'s flower-yoni, whose title formed Lilith \'s \nname. \n\nThe story of Lilith disappeared from the canonical Bible, but her \ndaughters the lilim haunted men for over a thousand years. Well into \nthe Middle Ages, the Jews were still manufacturing amulets to keep \naway the lilim, who were lustful she-demons given to copulating with \nmen in their dreams, causing nocturnal emissions. 5 Naturally, the lilim \nsquatted on top of their victims in the position favored by ancient \nmatriarchs. \n\nGreeks adopted the lilim and called them Lamiae, Empusae \n(Forcers-In), or Daughters of Hecate. Christians also adopted them \nand called them harlots of hell, or succubae, the female counterparts of \nincubi. Celibate monks tried to fend them off by sleeping with their \nhands crossed over their genitals, clutching a crucifix. It was said that \nevery time a pious Christian had a wet dream, Lilith laughed. Even if \na male child laughed in his sleep, people said Lilith was fondling him. \nTo protect baby boys against her, chalk circles were drawn around \ncradles with the written names of the three angels God sent to fetch \nLilith back to Adam even though these angels had proved incapa- \nble of dealing with her. Some said men and babies should not be left \nalone in a house or Lilith might seize them. 6 \n\nAnother common name for the Daughters of Lilith was Night- \nHag. This term didn\'t imply that they were ugly; on the contrary, \nthey were supposed to be very beautiful. 7 As with their brothers the \nincubi, they were presumed so expert at lovemaking that after an \nexperience with a Night-Hag, a man couldn\'t be satisfied with the love \nof a mortal woman. \n\n1.

Scot, 512. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLily \n\nThe flower of Lilith, Sumero-Babylonian Goddess of creation; the \nlilu or "lotus" of her genital magic. The lily often represented the virgin \naspect of the Triple Goddess, while the rose represented her maternal \naspect. The lily was sacred to Astarte, who was also Lilith; northern \nEuropeans called her Ostara or Eostre, the Goddess of "Easter" \nlilies. 1 \n\nBecause of its pagan associations with virgin motherhood, the lily \n\n\n\n542 \n\n\n\nM \n\n\n\nwas used to symbolize impregnation of the virgin Mary. Some \nauthorities claimed the lily in Gabriel\'s hand filtered God\'s semen which \nentered Mary\'s body through her ear. 2 \n\nMary\'s cult also inherited the lily of the Blessed Virgin Juno, who \nconceived her savior-son Mars with her own magic lily, without any \nmale aid. 3 This myth reflected an early belief in the self-fertilizing \npower of the yoni (vulva), which the lily symbolized and Juno \npersonified. Her name descended from the pre-Roman Uni, a Triple \nGoddess represented by the three-lobed lily or fleur-de-lis, her name \nstemming from the Sanskrit yoni, source of the Uni-verse. \n\nIn 656 a.d., the 10th Council of Toledo officially adopted the holy \nday of Juno\'s miraculous conception of Mars into the Christian \ncanon, renaming it the Festival of the Mother of God, or Lady Day, \ninsisting that it commemorated Mary\'s miraculous conception of \nJesus with the aid of a lily. 4 Christian artists showed the angel Gabriel \nholding out to Mary a scepter surmounted by a fleur-de-lis on a lily \nstalk. A scroll usually issued from Gabriel\'s mouth, with the words Ave \nMaria gratia plena, the seminal "Word," which made Mary "full." \nAphrodite\'s dove, that other yonic symbol, hovered about the scene. 5 \n\nCeltic and Gallo-Roman tribes called the virgin mother Lily Maid. \nHer yonic emblem appeared not only as the French fleur-de-lis but \nalso as the Irish shamrock, which was not originally Irish but a sacred \nsymbol among Indus Valley people some 6000 years before the \nChristian era. Christianized France identified the Lily Maid with the \nvirgin Mary, but she was never completely dissociated from the pagan \nimage of Juno. Among the people, Lady Day was known as Notre \nDame de Mars. 6 \n\nThe Easter lily was the medieval pas-flower, from Latin passus, to \nstep or pass over, cognate oipascha, the Passover. The lily was also \ncalled Pash-flower, Paschal flower, Pasque flower, or Passion flower. \nPagans understood that it represented the spring passion of the god, \nlike Heracles, for union in love-death with the Virgin Queen of \nHeaven, Hera-Hebe, or Juno, or Venus, all of whom claimed the lily. \nWhen Hera\'s milk spurted from her breasts to form the Milky Way, the \ndrops that fell to the ground became lilies. 7 \n\n1.

The lingam-yoni is \nstill the supreme symbol of the vital principle, representing male and \nfemale genitalia in conjunction. 1 Its verbal equivalent is the Jewel in \nthe Lotus. \n\nSometimes the lingam appeared as a phallic pillar in the cella or \njHoly of Holies, the core of the temple which stands for the Goddess \n\n\n\n543 \n\n\n\nLion and is called "womb" (garbha-grha). 2 Shiva bore the name of Sthanu, \n\nLittle Red Riding Hood "Pillar," and was shown emerging from a lingam-pillar with his \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ "jewel" or phallic eye displayed in the center of his forehead, a graphic \nillustration of the transformation of the whole lingam into a man- \nshape. 3 \n\nIt was a Hindu custom to have brides deflowered in the temple by \nShiva\'s carved lingam to make their firstborn children God-begotten \n(see Firstborn). Temple harlots were made "brides of God" by the \nsame ceremony of the lingam, as was also the custom in the ancient \nMiddle East, Greece, and Rome. 4 Besides these man-sized examples \nthere were large pillars, which often became objects of pilgrimage. \nMany miracles were said to have taken place in the vicinity of Shiva\'s \nlingam. 5 \n\n1.

Ishtar, Astarte, and Cybele rode or drove lions. Bast-Hathor \nwas the Sphinx-lioness, symbolizing the Destroyer. Sometimes she \nappeared with two lion heads looking forward and backward, like her \nRoman counterpart Janus-Jana. This was a symbol of Time, with the \nhieroglyph xerefu and akeru, the Lions of Yesterday and Today. 1 \n\nThe Dark Age kingdom of the Britons was named after the \n"Lyonesse," one of its early queens appearing in Arthurian romance \nas the Lady Lyonors. Merlin\'s city was Caerleon, the Lion\'s Place. \nLions were not native to the British isles, therefore the British lion \nwas an imported totem. Lion and serpent stood for ascending and \ndeclining spirits of the sacred year, the former following the latter in \nthe pagan zodiac. 2 \n\nThe British "Lady who ruled lions"may have arrived on Roman \ncoins, which since the Augustan period showed the Great Mother of \nthe Gods (Cybele) enthroned between two lions, wearing the mural \ncrown that became a Saxon emblem of divinity. She was thus \ndescribed in a poem: "The Virgin in her heavenly place rides upon the \nLion; bearer of corn, inventor of law, founder of cities, by whose gift \nit is man\'s good lot to know the gods; therefore she is the Mother of the \nGods, Peace, Virtue, Ceres, the Syrian Goddess, weighing life and \nlaws in her balance." 3 \n\n1.

See Werewolf. \n\n\n\nLogos \n\n\n\nLogos \n\nGreek "Word," a theory of creation that passed from Tantrism \nthrough Neoplatonic philosophy to Christianity. The theory was that a \ndeity could create anything other deities, worlds, creatures by the \npower of magic words: when the name was spoken, the thing material- \nized. The Logos, then, was divine essence concentrated in a Word \nand made manifest, as Jesus was called "the Word made flesh." The \nGospel of John gave him eternal existence: "In the beginning was the \nWord, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1). \n\nJudeo-Christian thinkers defined the Logos in so many ways \nthat it became virtually without meaning, and so was relegated to the \nstatus of a "deep mystery." The Logos was Christ, or the Wisdom of \nYahweh, or an archangel, or Truth, or the high priest, or the Law, or \nthe covenant, or the scriptures, or Moses, or the creative power, or \nthe soul of the world, or the sun, etc. 1 Orphic, Pythagorean, and \nNeoplatonic philosophers who expounded the Logos doctrine were \nnot well understood by their Christian followers, who struggled vainly \nwith the subtle semantics of the pagan philosophers. \n\nThe pagans\' "Word made flesh" was usually Hermes, represent- \ning the Logos spermatikos, seminal Word, proceeding from the \nmouth of Zeus to beget all things through the power of his agent on \nearth. 2 The Corpus Hermeticum praised this Word-bearer: "Holy art \nthou, who by the Word has created all things that exist! Holy art thou, \nof whom all Nature has produced the image!" Justin Martyr\'s \nApologia earnestly tried to assimilate the attributes of Hermes-the-Word \nto Jesus, "on account of his wisdom," claiming that Jesus was exactly \nlike Hermes in being the Son, Messenger, and Word of God. 3 \n\nOne of the reasons for male enthusiasm for the Logos doctrine was \nthat it provided male gods with a method of creating, formerly the \nexclusive prerogative of the birth-giving Goddess. Hermes-the-Logos \nbecame Hermes-the-Creator, exercising the magic feminine powers \nhe derived from living in androgynous union with Mother Aphrodite. \nThe Perfect Word addressed Hermes as not only the Light of the life \nof man but also "the fruitful Womb of All." 4 \n\nSimilarly, Hermes\'s Egyptian counterpart Thoth mastered the \nWords of Power and assumed the attributes of the Goddess Maat, \n"whose Word is Truth," sometimes called his spouse. Priests of Thoth\'s \nholy city, which the Greeks called Hermopolis, said Thoth was the \nuniversal demiurge who spoke the Word of creation, met, and "gave \nbirth" to the first gods. 5 \n\nThe oldest Oriental father-gods "gave birth" by speech, when they \nwere first conceived by men who didn\'t know the real physiology of \n\n\n\nThe Perfect Word \n\nThird-century Greek \ntext of Hermetic \nrevelation-literature, \ndiscovered by \nReitzenstein in the \nMimaut papyrus. \n\nMet, a mother-word \nrelated to Maat, Greek \nmetis, Sanskrit \nmedha, "female \nwisdom." 6 \n\n\n\n545 \n\n\n\nLogos \n\n\n\nAmong the oldest \nMesopotamian texts \nthere are stories of \ndeities representing \n"the Word." In the \nEpic of Gilgamesh, \nEnlil the god of "air" \nor "breath" was also a \nLogos: "The spirit of \nthe Word is Enlil, the \nspirit of the heart of \nAnu (heaven)." Enlil \nembodied "the word \nwhich stilleth the \nheavens above." 9 \n\nThe fifty letters of \nKali\'s Sanskrit alphabet \nwere matrika, \n"mothers." Hindu \nscriptures said: "As \nfrom a mother comes \nbirth, so from \nmatrika, or sound, the \nworld proceeds." 11 \nOm was the \nmantramatrika, \nMother of Mantras; and \nthese divine Words \nspoken by Kali created \nand destroyed \neverything, including all \ngods. 12 \n\n\n\nbegetting. The Sanskrit word for a father-given or Brahma-given soul \nwas atman, "air" or "breath," cognate with the German atmen and \nGreek atmos, "air." A Brahman father still establishes a paternal claim \nto a child by breathing its soul-name three times into its face, \npretending to place the soul in the body. 7 \n\nThe biblical Yahweh also claimed to give life by the power of his \nbreath or "wind," which he used to animate the dry bones of the \ndead: "Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live" \n(Ezekiel 37:5). This incident was probably copied from the Babylo- \nnian Enuma Elish, wherein Marduk established his right to kingship \namong the gods by showing he could destroy and re-create by the \npower of his Word. 8 \n\nThough male gods popularized the idea of the Logos, the ability \nto destroy and re-create by Word-power belonged originally to the \nGoddess, who created languages, alphabets, and the secret mantras \nknown as Words of Power, Egyptian hekau, creations of Hecate \n(Maat). Every manifestation of life was brought into being by the Great \nGoddess Kali with her Word, Om, an invocation of her own \n"pregnant belly." This was the primordial Logos, "the supreme syllable, \nthe mother of all sound." 10 Kali\'s creative voice had its own personifi- \ncation as a Goddess Vac (Voice), engendered in celestial waters, at the \nsummit of the Cosmic Tree. 13 Vac brought forth the god who called \nhimself All-father, as well as everything else in the universe. 14 She \nreappeared in Greek myth as a disembodied voice, the nymph Echo, \nwho brought the flower-god Narcissus to his doom by trapping his soul \nin her water-mirror. In Arabic her Om became Umm, meaning \nmother, matrix, source, principle, or prototype: the Logos of the Sufi. 15 \n\nOm was a familiar sound. Celts called their Moon-mother Omh, \n"She Who Is." Shebans called their Moon-temple at Marib Aum, \nthe Belly of the World. Lydians placed the same Belly of the World in \ntheir own country as an omphalos or navel-stone, hub of the \nuniverse, "made flesh" in their Goddess-queen Omphale. It was not an \nexclusively Lydian custom; every temple in Greece hid an omphalos. \n\nOm was Alpha, the letter of creation, repeated again as the final \nletter of destruction, Omega, which means literally "great Om." Its \nGreek form is a horseshoe, based on the Hindu symbol of the yonic \nGate. When the biblical prophet proclaimed: "I am the Alpha and \nOmega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and \nwhich was, and which is yet to come" (Revelation 1 :8), he used words \ncopied from the temple of the Great Mother at Sais, where they were \nwritten on stone many centuries before the Bible was compiled. 16 \n\nThe Logos idea was virtually identical with the Oriental concept of \nthe Oversoul, which had been an essence of the Great Mother but \nwas re-defined as an essence of the Great Father or of his son, the \nSavior. Origen said, "As our body while consisting of human mem- \nbers is yet held together by one soul, so the universe is to be thought of \nas an immense living being which is held together by one soul, the \n\n\n\n546 \n\n\n\npower of the logos." I7 Christ was only one of many aspirants to the title \nof Logos. Before him, Attis was hailed as the Logos "who holds the \nuniverse together." 18 But before them all was the Great Mother: "The \nsupreme Shakti has the form both of the seed and the sprout of the \nrevealed coming-together of Shiva and Shakti; subtlest of the subtle, She \nb contained in all that lies between the first and the last letters of the \nalphabet, which contains the original root forms from which the names \nof everything in the world are compounded." 19 \n\nThe Christian idea that Christ was God\'s "Word made flesh" was \nan idea common to all the ancient pagan world. Every king was \nliterally God manifested in the flesh, whether he was a real ruler or a \nsacramental surrogate ruler. Usually he was called Savior, and begot- \nten by the god on a temple virgin. He was chosen and invested by holy \nwords and name-souls. Antiochus of Syria, for instance, received the \ndivine surname of Epiphanes, "God Made Manifest (in the flesh)." 20 \n\nNot even Christians, however, managed to purge the Logos of all \nits original feminine connotations. Clement of Alexandria distorted \nhis symbolism to the point of absurdity when trying to connect the \nLogos with parenthood: "The Word is everything to the child, both \nfather and mother, teacher and nurse. . . . The nutriment is the milk of \nthe Father . . . and the Word alone supplies us children with the milk \nof love. . . . For this reason, seeking is called sucking; to those infants \nwho seek the Word, the Father\'s loving breasts supply milk." 21 \n\nThese odd notions arose from the ancient belief that a mother gave \nher child its name-soul along with the first breast milk, as she \nbreathed a Word that would henceforth define and personify the child. \nIn the Old Testament, children were named by their mothers, never \nby their fathers. 22 Thus a universal Parent would be expected to give \nname-souls to all creation along with universal breast milk. \n\nA giver of nourishment was also a giver of Law, derived from the \nsame root word as Logos. Priest-chieftain of the Icelandic Althing \nsupreme governing body of the tribes had a title now translated \nLawspeaker. But that is not the literal translation of the Icelandic \nword, logsogumathr, which really means Mother- Who-Speaks-the- \nWord. 23 \n\nThe doctrine of the Logos was so widespread that Christians could \nhardly be expected to ignore it. It was one of many pagan ideas that \nme church eagerly seized. Medieval Schoolmen tried to make it \nreconcile faith with reason, insisting that the two must be identical \nbecause their root was the same: "that no more than one source of \ntruth, the Logos, had ever existed, and that everything of any value in \nhuman wisdom, especially in Greek philosophy, flowed from that sole \nBource. Plato himself was reputed to have pilfered from Moses." 24 \n\nThe Schoolmen were ignorant of the ancient logoi, sacred writings \npf the Orphics, mentioned by Plato and other philosophers as a vast \nmass of literature amounting to a true "Bible"; these writings had all \nbeen destroyed during the early centuries of Christianity. 25 But there \n\n\n\nLogos \n\n\n\nSchoolmen \n\nPhilosophical and \ntheological thinkers \nof the "Scholastic" \nmovement, 1 1th to \n15 th centuries, \nincluding such \nauthorities as Abelard, \nAquinas, Duns \nScotus, Ockham, and \nAlbertus Magnus. \n\n\n\n547 \n\n\n\nLohengrin \n\nLoki \n\n\n\nGospel of Truth \n\nGnostic scripture \nassociated with the \nearly Christian sect of \nValentinians, \nfounded about 1 50 a.d. \n\n\n\nwere Christian Gnostic writings that had copied the Orphics and \ntransmitted the idea of the Logos to Christian dogma even after they \nwere declared "heresies." The Gospel of Truth said, for example, \n"When the Word appeared, the Word which is in the hearts of those \nwho pronounced It. . . . It was not only a sound, but It had taken on a \nbody as well." 26 Christians gave such assertions a rather simplistic \ninterpretation, assuming the body was Christ\'s; yet perhaps the more \nperceptive of the ancient philosophers meant that man, the verbaliz- \ning animal, in effect creates all his gods out of his Word. \n\nI.

The holy swan, Leda\'s lover, was transformed \ninto a Knight of the Holy Grail, dedicated to helping women maintain \ntheir legal rights under a patriarchal system. See Swan. \n\n\n\nLoki was sometimes \nLogi, "Flame," the fire \ngod identified with \nthe Celtic Lug, and \nprobably descended \nfrom the Aryan Agni- \nShiva as the \nlightning-fire \n"quenched" by his \nmarriage to the \nGoddess of the \nwatery abyss. Indeed, \nunder the name of \nAgni, the god was "an \nearly king of \nSweden" married to the \nGoddess Skialf, or \nSkadi. 7 \n\n\n\nLoki \n\nNorse god of complex character and great age. He may have been a \ngenius loci, "spirit of a place." His name may have descended from \nSanskrit Loka, a spirit of the seven celestial planes. He was an archaic \nform of the "Luck" envisioned as guardian angel of a clan or family, \noften embodied in a fetish object. 1 One story said Loki\'s lips were \nstitched up with a thong, suggesting that his spirit dwelt in a mummified \noracular head. 2 Such heads were also used as clan-spirits by the early \nHebrews, who called them teraphim} To lose them was to lose the \nfamily\'s "luck." \n\nLike many of the oldest gods, Loki was bisexual. He even \nsucceeded in becoming a mother, though only after he had swal- \nlowed a woman\'s heart to acquire the power of birth-giving. The Greek \nZeus resorted to the same feminine magic, for the same reason. \nLoki\'s offspring was the eight-legged horse Sleipnir, spirit of death, a \nsymbol of the gallows tree on which Odin rode. 4 \n\nLoki was also a death spirit in his own right, like Shiva the \nDestroyer who often appeared as Shiva the Destroyed, dead under \nthe feet of Kali the Crone, his guts pulled out of his belly and devoured. \nThe same thing happened to Loki as he was periodically sacrificed to \nSkadi the Crone. 5 Also like the Oriental god, Loki always came back to \n\n\n\n548 \n\n\n\nlife. Though the other Aesir chained him up, as the wolf Fenrir and Longinus, Saint \n\nthe troublemaking Prometheus were chained, yet Loki\'s inevitable Lotus \n\ndestiny was to break free and initiate the ultimate convulsions of the ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nworld\'s doomsday. 6 Aryan belief postulated seven Lokas before the final \nparadise of Shiva and Shakti; thus it might be assumed that Loki \nwould have seven incarnations before the final death of the gods. \n\nl.Avalon.40. 2.

Some of Jesus\'s blood \nfell on his eyes and cured his blindness, whereupon Longinus was \nconverted and spent the rest of his life breaking pagan idols in \nCappadocia. 1 \n\nThis canonization-story made even less sense than most, as Ro- \nman centurions were not blind. Possibly in an original version, now \nlost, Longinus was stricken blind after delivering the spear-thrust; but \nthis would have allowed no time for his conversion. \n\nThe true prototype of the legend seems to have been the blind god \nHod, who slew the Norse savior Balder with the thrust of a spear of \nmistletoe. Early-medieval missionaries deliberately confused Jesus with \nBalder. Some even declared the cross of Jesus\'s crucifixion was made \nof mistletoe. 2 \n\nMarch 1 5, the "Ides of March" when most pagan saviors died, was \nthe day devoted to Hod by the heathen, and later Christianized as the \nfeast day of the Blessed Longinus. 3 \n\n1.

Possibly it was \nonce a shrine of the Water-goddess. Early in the 19th century, a \nGerman writer transformed the Lorelei into the usual maiden disap- \npointed in love. She threw herself in the river, and afterward \nappeared as a spirit of the rock, singing her fatal songs to passing \nboatmen. 1 \n\nl.Encyc. Brit, "Lorelei." \n\n\n\nLotus \n\nAsia\'s primary symbol of the yoni (vulva), often personified as the \nGoddess Padma, "Lotus," also known as Cunti, Lakshmi, or Shakti. \n\n\n\n549 \n\n\n\nLotus The central phrase of Tantrism, Om manipadme hum, meant the \n\nJewel (male) in the Lotus (female), with interlocking connotations: the \n^^^^^^^^^^__ penis in the vagina, the fetus in the womb, the corpse in the earth, \nthe God in the Goddess representing all of these. 1 \n\nThe father-god Brahma claimed to be a universal creator; never- \ntheless, he was styled "Lotus-born," for he arose from the primal \nGoddess\'s yoni. Egypt\'s father-god Ra also claimed to be a creator but \nowed his existence to the Goddess called "great world lotus flower, \nout of which rose the sun for the first time at the creation." 2 \n\nVirtually all Egyptian Goddess-forms were symbolized by the \nlotus. 3 Pharaohs were sexually united with the World Lotus to \nachieve rebirth after death. The funeral hymn of Unas declared that he \n"had union with the goddess Mut, Unas hath drawn unto himself the \nflame of Isis, Unas hath united himself to the lotus." 4 \n\nOne way of uniting oneself to the lotus was the custom of ritual \ncunnilingus, widely practiced throughout the east as communion \nwith the feminine life-principle. 5 This was probably the true meaning of \nthe Land of Lotus-Eaters visited by Odysseus and his crew. The \nsensual Land of Lotus-Eaters was described as a tropical place beyond \nthe southern sea, which could apply to any land from Egypt to India. 6 \n\nAscetic Jain Buddhism tried to eradicate the lotus symbol because \nof its erotic implications. Nevertheless, a few centuries after Buddha\'s \ntime, the most prominent figure on Buddhist monuments was again \nPadma, openly displaying her genital lotus. 7 A similar resurgence of \nerotic imagery overtook ascetic Christianity, when "obscene" figures \nproliferated in cathedrals and churches, for example the Irish sheila- \nna-gig. \n\nMost Oriental mystics held that spiritual knowledge began with \ncarnal knowledge. The lotus was the Goddess\'s gate, and sex was the \nWay through the gate to her inner mysteries. With proper sexual \nexercises, a true sage might achieve the final flowering of revelation \ndescribed as the thousand-petaled lotus of invisible light emanating from \nthe top of the head after ascending the spinal chakras from the pelvis. \n\nWorshippers of Vishnu sometimes painted their god as the source \nof the World Lotus, which grew on a long stem from his navel. But \nsince "the primary reference of the lotus in India has always been the \ngoddess Padma, \'Lotus,\' whose body itself is the universe, the long \nstem from navel to lotus should properly connote an umbilical cord \nthrough which the flow of energy would be running from the \ngoddess to the god, mother to child, not the other way." 8 Some Hindu \ncosmogonies saw the whole world as the lotus flower, with seven \npetals representing the seven divisions of the heavens where the cities \nand palaces of the god were located. 9 \n\nIn the Middle East, the lotus was Hlu, or lily. 10 It was the flower of \nLilith, the Sumero-Babylonian earth mother claimed by the Jews as \nAdam\'s first wife. The three-lobed lily or fleur-de-lis, like the shamrock, \nonce stood for the Triple Goddess\'s three yonis, which is why the lily \n\n\n\n550 \n\n\n\nwas sacred to the triune Queen of Heaven. The Blessed Virgin Juno Lotus Position \n\nconceived her savior-son Mars by the lily, and the same flower was Lucifer \n\nadopted as a conception-charm of the Blessed Virgin Mary. 11 When Isis ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nwas assimilated to the burgeoning legends of the Virgin, her Egyptian \nimages held the phallic cross in one hand, the female lotus seed-vessel in \nthe other, like the Goddess shown on the Isiac Table. 12 \n\n1 .

Canaanites called him Shaher. The Jewish \nShaharit (Morning Service) still commemorates him. 1 Shaher\'s twin \nbrother Shalem, the Evening Star, announced the daily death of the sun \nand spoke to him the Word of Peace (Hebrew shahm, Arabic \nsalaam). 2 Shalem was worshipped along with his brother in Jerusalem, \nwhich means "House of Shalem." Shaher and Shalem were the same \nas the Greeks\' Dioscuri or Heavenly Twins, Castor and Pollux, born of \nLeda\'s World Egg. They were also prominent in Persian sun worship \nas the two torch-bearers, one with his torch ascendant and the other \nwith his torch directed down. 5 \n\nBoth Shaher and Shalem were born of the Great Mother Asherah \nin her world-womb aspect as Helel, "the Pit." 4 Canaanite myth said \nShaher coveted the superior glory of the sun god and tried to usurp his \nthrone, but was defeated and cast down from heaven like a lightning \nbolt. Pagan scriptures of the 7th century B.C. included a dirge for the \nfallen Morning Star: \n\nHow hast thou fallen from heaven, Helel\'s son Shaher! Thou didst say in \nthy heart, I will ascend to heaven, above the circumpolar stars I will \nraise my throne, and I will dwell on the Mount of Council in the back of \nthe north; I will mount on the back of a cloud, I will be like unto \nElyon. s \n\nCenturies later, a Jewish scribe copied this Canaanite scripture into \nthe Bible and pretended it was written by Isaiah: \n\n\n\n551 \n\n\n\nLucifer H ow ar t thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! . . . For \n\nthou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend to heaven, I will exalt my \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the \n\ncongregation, in the sides of the north: J will ascend above the heights \nof the clouds; I will be like the most High. (Isaiah 14:12-14) \n\nThe biblical writer further told Lucifer: "Thou shalt be brought \ndown to hell, to the sides of the pit" (Isaiah 14:1 5). This "pit" was the \nsame as Helel, or Asherah, the god\'s own Mother-bride; and his \ndescent as a lightning-serpent into her Pit represented fertilization of the \nabyss by masculine fire from heaven. In short, the Light-bringer \nchallenged the supreme solar god by seeking the favors of the Mother. \nThis divine rivalry explains the so-called sin of Lucifer, hubris, which \nchurch fathers translated "pride" but its real meaning was "sexual \npassion." 6 \n\nActually, all sacred kings aspired to the same proud position \nLucifer or Shaher coveted: to be the spouse of the Goddess, to stand \nat the hub of the heavens (carried thence on a cloud), to become one \nwith the supreme deity. Egyptian pharaohs made almost identical \nclaims to glory, as shown by Pepi\'s tomb inscription stating that he \n"standeth upon the north of heaven with Ra, he becometh lord of the \nuniverse like unto the king of the gods." 7 He also descended into the \nearth in the guise of the immortal serpent Sata, father of lightning; \nand his Hebrew name Satan merged with the image of Lucifer in \nJesus\'s words: "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven" (Luke \n10:18). \n\nLucifer continued to be linked with both lust and lightning during \nthe Christian era. He became the Prince of the Power of the Air \n(Ephesians 2:2) who threw his lightning bolts at church towers. He \nwielded the trident, in Eastern symbolism a triple lightning-phallus \ndestined to fertilize the Triple Goddess. 8 \n\nAnother ancient source of the Lucifer legend was the Assyro- \nBabylonian lightning god, Zu the Storm Bird, a forerunner of Zeus; \nsometimes he was a seraph or "fiery flying serpent," the lightning bolt \npersonified. Zu was punished for coveting the power-filled Tablets of \nDestiny that Great Mother Tiamat had given her firstborn son, the \nfather of gods. Zu said to himself, "I will take the tablet of destiny of \nthe gods, even I; and I will direct all the oracles of the gods; I will \nestablish a throne, and dispense commands, I will rule over all the \nspirits of Heaven!" 9 \n\nEgypt called the Morning Star god Bennu, the dying-and-reborn \nPhoenix bird known as "Soul of Ra," who died on the World Tree in \norder to renew himself, to "shine on the world." His spirit dwelt in the \nphallic obelisk, called Bennu or the Benben-stone, which stood for \nthe god\'s sexual union with the Mother. Another of his phallic forms \nwas the mighty serpent Ami-Hemf, "Dweller in his Flame," who \nlived on the Mountain of Sunrise and was identified with the morning \nstar. 10 Thus Egypt and Mesopotamia had several versions of light- \n\n\n\n552 \n\n\n\nbringing Lucifer long before scraps of his myth found their way into \nJudeo-Christian writings. \n\nPlato knew the morning-star god as Aster (Star) and also under- \nstood that the same star appeared at evening in a different position \nand so became the evening star (actually the planet Venus). Plato \ntherefore viewed Aster as the dying-and-reborn deity himself: "Aster, \nonce, as Morning-Star, light on the living you shed. Now, dying, as \nEvening-Star, you shine among the dead." u \n\nGnostic Christians maintained that the "light" Lucifer brought \nwas true enlightenment, which he gave humanity against God\'s will, \nas Prometheus stole the fire of heaven to bring civilization to mankind \nagainst the will of Zeus. The Bible\'s story supported the Gnostic \nview. God denied Adam and Eve the fruit of the tree of knowledge, \ndesiring to keep them ignorant; but Lucifer, in the form of the \nserpent, gave them the "light" of wisdom. \n\nThe Persians, too, said their own Great Serpent Ahriman gave \nknowledge to the first couple in the garden of Heden. Ahriman too \nwas the twin brother of the solar God, cast out of heaven for his hubris; \nbut the Magi worshipped the Great Serpent as the source of their \noccult wisdom. 12 He was often thought more influential in terrestrial \naffairs than the Father who cast him down. \n\nSuch Persian precedents influenced Gnostic Christians who re- \ngarded Jehovah as the villain and Lucifer as the hero, savior, and \nfriend of man, revealer of sacred mysteries that the Heavenly Father \njealously withheld. Medieval secret fraternities perpetuated the Gnos- \ntics\' respect for Lucifer and sometimes identified him with Hermes, god \nof revelation. These Gnostic doctrines persisted through the first half \nof the Christian era and well into the second half. 13 Meister Eckhart \nsaid, "Lucifer, the angel, who is in hell, had perfectly pure intellect \nand to this day knows much." H \n\nIn the 14th century a.d. there were Gnostic groups called Lucifer- \nans, who "worship Lucifer and believe him to be the brother of God, \nwrongly cast out of heaven." 15 Luciferans were first heard of in Austria. \nTheir cult soon spread to Brandenburg, Bohemia, Switzerland, and \nSavoy. In 1336 the Inquisition burned fourteen men and women at \nMagdeburg for holding heretical opinions about Lucifer. In 1384, a \npriest at Prenzlau accused his entire congregation of believing that \nLucifer was God or the brother of God. 16 \n\nOne of the "great questions" among medieval Schoolmen was \nhow many angels fell with Lucifer and how many remained in \nheaven under the command of Michael. Some authorities said "most" \nangels fell. Some said "most" remained. Some said a tenth, a ninth, \nor a third of the angelic host fell, because "the dragon with his tail \nplucked down with him the third part of the stars." Furious debate \nraged also between Thomists, Scotists, and followers of Augustine on \nthe "great question" of the battle\'s location and duration. It was said \nto have taken place in the air, in the firmament, or in paradise. It lasted \n\n\n\nLucifer \n\n\n\nMeister Eckhart \nvon Hochheim Popular \nGerman mystical \npreacher of the early \n14th century; minister \nof a Dominican \norder in Saxony.

She bestowed the gifts of light, enlightenment, and \neyesight, especially as the opener of eyes of newborn children. 1 \n\nThe bogus "St. Lucy" bore the same symbols and was advertised \nas a patron of sufferers from eye diseases. Lucy, or Lucia, was one of \nthe most popular of medieval saints, ranking with Agatha, Catherine, \nand Mary Magdalene as a leading ecclesiastical money-maker. \n\nLucy\'s legend was the same "virgin martyr" story told of dozens of \nother mythical female saints. Her devotion to chastity was so great \nthat when a pagan suitor admired her beautiful eyes, she cut them from \ntheir sockets and sent them to him on a platter, asking to be left in \npeace henceforth. This was how Christians interpreted the Goddess\'s \npatera with its offerings. \n\nThe legend went on to say the pagans tried to execute St. Lucy for \nthe alleged crime of keeping her virginity. But when they tried to \ndrag her out of the temple where she had been imprisoned, she stood \nrooted to the floor as heavily as a great statue. She couldn\'t be moved \neven with ropes and pulleys. A fire built on the stone floor around her \nalso failed to destroy her. Finally she was killed by a sword thrust. 2 \n\nDetails of this naive legend show that "St. Lucy" really was a \ncolossal statue of Juno Lucina, whose jeweled eyes were gouged out \nby a Christian vandal; but destroying the statue proved difficult, as it was \ntoo heavy to be moved. In the end, Juno was broken up and removed \nfrom her temple in pieces but superstitious dread inspired the awe that \ncanonized her. The most significant detail in the legend said Lucy \nwas once very rich, but she distributed all her wealth to poor Christians. \nThis wealth evidently consisted of the expensive temple furnishings \nwhich were informally distributed among the looters. Robbing temples \nand smashing their holy statues was one of the major occupations of \npoor Christians in Rome during the 4th and 5th centuries. 3 \n\n\n\n554 \n\n\n\nPeople whom the church called witches apparently remembered Ludus \n\nbt. Lucy as the pagan Goddess Lucina, and continued to worship her Lug \n\nWith pagan ceremonies even though she was concealed by a Christian ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ntloak. As late as 1890, Tuscan witches still used Lucina\'s healing \n[-harm, a wreath of rue tied with red ribbon, making the patient spit \nhree times through the wreath calling on "St. Lucy" for protection \njigainst the evil eye. 4 \n\nOther versions of the same Goddess, such as Triduana (Diana \nrriformis) and the Irish Medana, were also assimilated to Christianity \nis fictitious saints, of whom the same story was told: they were beautiful \n[irgins who gouged out their eyes rather than succumb to the \nemptations of love. 5 It seems the new churches inherited from the ruin \nIf the old pagan world a great many eyeless female statues. \n\nSome medieval sources viewed Lucy as a female Christ and \nIttributed to her the same miracles performed by Jesus. She could \nestore sight to the blind, and by her magic touch she cured her own \npother\'s "issue of blood." 6 \n\nIn Sicily, St. Lucy continued to rule the Festival of Lights on the \nhortest day of the year, recalling the ancient festival of Juno Lucina \n(ekindling the sun. Swedish celebrations of the day still feature a girl \nRearing a crown of candles, known as the Lussibruden (Lucy \nferide). 7 \n\n1. Lxrousse, 203-4. 2. Brewster, 21. 3. J.H.

Lugd, Lud \n\n\n\n555 \n\n\n\nLuna \n\nLupa \n\n\n\nLug was \n\nChristianized as several \nsaints: St. Lugad, St. \nLuan, St. Eluan, and \nSt. Lugidus, \ndepending on local \ndialects. Irish \nlegendary history called \nhim a King Lugadius \nmartyred by a lance- \nthrust from a druidic \npriest a story taken \nquite directly from \nancient cults of the \nsacred-king/dying- \ngod. Lug perished after \nmarrying the Great \nGoddess called "the \nSovereignty of Erin \nuntil the day of \ndoom." 3 \n\n\n\nbrides in a custom reminiscent of the Goddess\'s ancient rites of sacred \npromiscuity and defloration. The hill where payments were collected \nwas known as the Hill of the Buying. 4 \n\nTaillten was so notorious for promiscuity that any casual sexual \naffair came to be known as a Taillten marriage. 5 Taillten marriages \nwere actually legal up to the 1 3 th century. They were supposed to last \nthe period specified by the old lunar calendars, a year and a day. 6 \n\nLug\'s curious name may have come in some remote past time \nfrom Mesopotamia, where the title of a sacred king, the Goddess\'s \nspouse, was lugal. 7 \n\n1.

Together they represented fire and \nwater, whose combination produced the Blood of Life. Luna the \nwatery moon used to be considered superior to Sol the fiery sun. Even \nChaucer wrote of "Luna the Serene, / Chief goddess of the ocean \nand its queen, / Though Neptune have therein his deity, / Is over him \nand empress of the sea." \' \n\nMany myths present the Moon-goddess as the Creatress who first \ndrifted alone on the primal ocean of chaos until she decided to bring \norderly forms out of elemental formlessness. Thus she was specifically \n"Moon Shining Over the Sea" to Scandinavian pagans. 2 Finns \ncalled her Luonnotar, sometimes loosely translated Daughter of Nature \nBut she was not the daughter of anything; she existed all alone in \nprimordial time, until she tired of loneliness and decided to create a \nworld. 3 See Moon. \n\nChristians claimed the worshippers of Luna were crazy, hence the \nword "lunatic," a person moon-touched or moon-struck. To this day, \nmany people believe lunacy is affected by the moon, being character- \nized by increased psychic disturbance when the moon is full. \n\n1. Chaucer, 435. 2. Briffault 3, 67. 3.

Lupa\'s temple harlots were lupae, sometimes \ncalled Queens (or high priestesses) in outlying towns of the empire. \nLupa\'s greatest festival was the annual Lupercalia, celebrated in the \nGrotto of the She- Wolf, with orgiastic rites to insure the year\'s \nfertility. After participating in the ceremony, naked youths traveled \nthroughout Palatine towns to "purify" them. 1 Perhaps this was why, \n\n\n\n556 \n\n\n\ntfter Lupa\'s festival was adopted by the Christian church, it was Lupus \n\n|enamed the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin. 2 See Dog; Lycaon \n\nWerewolf. ^^^^^^^^^i \n\n1.

The universality of the \nmother-word (not shared by words for "father") indicates either that \nthe human race carried the same word from its earliest source to all parts \nof the earth at a period previous to the discovery of fatherhood; or \nelse that all human beings instinctively say something like "ma" as the \nfirst verbal sound and associate it with the mother\'s breast, conse- \nquently with emotional dependence on a divinity perceived as a \nmilk-giving mother notwithstanding the absurd reference of Moses \nto a "nursing father" carrying the sucking child in his bosom (Numbers \n11:12). \n\nIn the Far East, the maternal blood bond that joined members of \nthe matrilineal clan was mamata, "mine-ness." 4 Its sacred letter Ma, \nin pictographic form as the Spark of Life (bindu or vindu), was said to \nbe "in the Great Yoni." 5 This scripture referred to a mystic essence \nuniting all the souls in a matrilineal kinship group. Ma or mamata \nexpressed the idea that descendants of the same mother shared the \nsame blood and couldn\'t injure one another without injuring them- \nselves; therefore the concept of the maternal clan was a practical \ninstrument of peace. \n\nIn Indo-European root languages, Ma was often defined as "intel- \nligence," the maternal force that bound elements together to create \nforms at the beginning of the world. 6 Ancient Egypt gave this maternal \nforce such names as Ma-Nu, Maa, or Maat, the Great Goddess of \nthe All-Seeing Eye and the spirit of Truth. 7 \n\nThe primitive Iranian Moon-goddess Mah (or Al-Mah, the Moon) \nwas another form of the same deity. Arabs called her Qis-Mah, \n"Fate," which the Turks corrupted into kismet. She gave birth to a \nseries of Messiahs, each one called the Mahdi, one guided or given \nby Mother Mah. Persians made her name a sacred Word, formed of the \nletters Mourdad-Ameretat, "Death-Rebirth." 8 The ideogram MA \nwas said to mean a state of immortality brought about by drinking the \nmilk of the Goddess\'s breast, which brings one back to the original \nMa-Ma. \n\nIn Hebrew the same sacred letters MA made the Mem-Aleph, \ncombining ideographs of "fluid" and "birth." This holy sign was \ncredited with great protective power, and was written on Jewish amulets \ndating from the early 9th century B.C. 9 It could have been copied \nfrom either the Persians or the Egyptians, whose Mother Isis wore an \n"Amulet of Ma," a vase representing her own fountains of nourish- \ning fluid. 10 Or again, as Ma-Nu, the Primal Deep, she was symbolized \nby three cauldrons. 11 Even today the Tantric Goddess as a personifi- \ncation of "fertilizing water" is named Mamaki. 12 \n\nIn Egyptian myth, a reversal of the Ma-Ma of nourishing breasts \nproduced the female Devourer in the underworld: Am-Am, eater of \n\n\n\n560 \n\n\n\nSouls. In the cyclic fashion of the elder religions, the giver was trans- Maat \n\nI Formed into the taker. 13 \n\nMa, the Great Goddess of Comana, was "worshipped by a whole \n\nj:>eople of hierodules in the ravines of the Taurus and along the banks ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nbf the Iris. Like Cybele she was an ancient Anatolian divinity and \njjersonified fertile nature." H She was taken to Rome where she \njTierged with the war goddess Bellona, who personified fighting spirit as \nndomitable as that of a mother defending her young. \n\nToday the divine implications of the syllable Ma are recognized \nbnly in obscure semi-magical cults like voodooism, where a priestess \nbmbodies the Goddess\'s spirit and is known as mamaloiox mambo. ls \nHowever, Ma is still a universal synonym for "mother."

Maat\'s symbol was the feather against \njvhich she weighed each man\'s heart-soul (ab) in her underground Hall \npf Judgment. Thus the Plume of Maat itself became a hieroglyph for \n\n\'truth." 1 \n\nThe same feathers of Truth were worn by other aspects of the \nGoddess, such as Isis, who was the same lawgiving Mother. The gods \nthemselves were constrained to "live by Maat." Her law governed all \n\nhree worlds ruled by her trinity as "Lady of heaven, queen of the \nearth, and mistress of the underworld." 2 \n\nAs the lawgiver of archaic Egypt, Maat was comparable to Babylo- \n\nlian Tiamat who gave the sacred tablets to the first king of gods. \njVIaat\'s laws were notably benevolent, compared to the harsh commands \npf later patriarchal gods, backed up by savage threats like those of \nDeuteronomy 28:1 5-68. An Egyptian was expected to recite the \nFamous Negative Confession in the presence of Maat and Thoth (or \nknubis) to show he had obeyed Maat\'s rules of behavior: \n\n\n\n/ have not been a man of anger. I have done no evil to mankind. I have \nnot inflicted pain. I have made none to weep. I have done violence to \nno man. I have not done harm unto animals. I have not robbed the poor. I \nhave not fouled water. I have not trampled fields. I have not behaved \nwith insolence. I have not judged hastily. I have not stirred up strife. I have \nnot made any man to commit murder for me. I have not insisted that \nexcessive work be done for me daily. I have not borne false witness. I have \nnot stolen land. I have not cheated in measuring the bushel. I have \n\n\n\n561 \n\n\n\nMaat allowed no man to suffer hunger. I have not increased my wealth except \n\nwith such things as are my own possessions. I have not seized \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ wrongfully the property of others. I have not taken milk from the mouths \n\nof babes. * \n\nThose who lived by the laws of Maat took a sacramental drink, \ncomparable to the Hindus\' Soma or its Persian counterpart Haoma, \nwhich conferred ritual purity in the same sense as the Christian \n"washing in the blood of the Lamb." Egyptian scribes of the 3rd \nmillenium B.C. wrote: "My inward parts have been washed in the \nliquor of Maat." Like baptismal water of life, Maat\'s potion brought life- \nafter-death to the peaceful, but death overtook violent persons. 4 \n\nEgyptian moral precepts were of a high order, many of them \nturning up centuries later in the Bible: \n\nTake heed not to rob the poor, and be not cruel to the destitute. . . . If \nthou canst answer the man who attacks thee, do him no injury. Let the \nevildoer alone; he will destroy himself. We must help the sinner, for may \nwe not become like him? . . . Crusts of bread and a loving heart are \nbetter than rich food and contention. . . . Learn to be content with what \nthou hast. Treasure obtained by fraud will not stay with thee; thou hast \nit today, tomorrow it has departed. . . . The approval of man is better than \nriches. s \n\nUnder the feudal disorders of the 12th dynasty, old rules began \nto break down along with the matrilineal clan system that supported \nthem, and educated Egyptians deplored the disruptions of society. A \nHeliopolitan priest wrote: "Maat is cast out, iniquity is in the midst of \nthe council hall. . . . [T]he poor man has no strength to save himself \nfrom him that is stronger than he." 6 Sometimes kinsman murdered \nkinsman, in violation of the clan\'s most sacred rule. One writer \nunfavorably compared his countrymen to the Maat-worshipping tribes \nof Nubia: "The Matoi, who are friendly towards Egypt, say: \'How \ncould there be a man that would slay his brother?\' " 7 \n\nMaat was more than a judge of the dead. She was a stand-in for all \nEgyptian Goddesses, including Hathor, Mut, Isis, Neith, Nekhbet, \netc. The sun god was told: "The goddess Maat embraceth thee both at \nmorn and at eve." As a birth-giver, she was sometimes Metet, the \nMorning Boat of the Sun, translated "becoming strong" and corre- \nsponding to the Greco-Roman mother of dawn, Mater Matuta. 8 She \nwas worshipped in lands other than Egypt. Northern Syria was called by \nthe Hittites, Mat Hatti: that is, Mother of Hatti. 9 Egyptian priests \ndrew the Feather of Maat on their tongues in green dye, to give their \nwords a Logos-like power of Truth so their verbal magic could create \nreality. 10 Similarly in northern Europe the divine bard Bragi had this \npower because of the runes engraved on his tongue by the Goddess \nIdun. \n\nAfrican Pygmies still know Maat by the name she bore in Sumeria \nas "womb" and "underworld": Matu. She was the first woman, and \n\n\n\n562 \n\n\n\nhe mother of God. Like her Egyptian counterpart she was sometimes Mab, Queen \n\nfat-headed." Macha \n\nI. Budge, E.L., 68. 2. Budge, G.E. 1, 418. 3.

Like other versions of the deadly mother \ni Morgan, Durga, Uma, Kara), she haunted battlefields and made magic \n\nvith the blood of slain men. 2 She was also identified with the Fairy \nQueen, Mab. As a trinitarian Goddess, she cast her death curse on Cu \nphulainn in the guise of three druidic "sorceresses of Mab." 3 \n\nSome said the voice of Macha summoned men to death, and it was \nJhe same as the dread voice of the Banshee, or "woman of the \n\n\n\n563 \n\n\n\nMader-Akka barrow-graves." 4 Since followers of the Old Religion went to her land \n\nMaera of death, naturally their spirits inhabited the ancient tombs that also \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ represented her womb of rebirth. \n\n1.

This teaching stemmed ultimately from Egypt, \nwhere the Three Wise Men were the three stars in the Belt of Orion, \npointing to Osiris\'s star Sothis (Sirius), which "rose in the east" to \nannounce the coming of the Savior at the season of the Nile flood. \n(See Osiris.) These three Belt stars were still called Magi in the Middle \nAges. 1 \n\nIn Rome early in the Christian era, Magi meant priests of Mithra \n(the original Persian "Messiah"), or astrologers, or miscellaneous \nhealers and miracle-workers; it was a term for magicians in general. \nRoman Christians were hostile to the Magi but were forced to retain \n\n\n\nMagdala \nMagi \n\n\n\n$ \n\n\n\nStar of David (Hexagram) \n\n\n\n565 \n\n\n\nMagic \n\n\n\nthe three Magi of the Gospel story because their presence was empha- \nsized as evidence of Jesus\'s divinity. \n\nl.Jobes,221. \n\n\n\nGiovanni della \nPorta\'s list said ancient \nmagicians were \ncalled magos by \nPersians; sapientes by \nthe Latins; philosophes \nby the Greeks; \nBrachmanes or \ngymnosophistas by \nthe Indians; Chaldaeos \nby the Babylonians \nand Assyrians; Drydas, \nBardos, and \nSemnothesby the \nCelts; sacerdotes by \nthe Egyptians; and \nprophetes by the \nCabalists. History\'s \nleading magicians \nwere Persia\'s Zoroaster, \nRome\'s Numa \nPompilius, Thrace\'s \nZalmoxis, Babylon\'s \nBuddha, and Egypt\'s \nHermes. 3 \n\n\n\nGiovanni della \n\nPorta (1535-1615) \nNeapolitan philosopher \nand author, who \nwrote comedies as well \nas scientific treatises \non magnetism, \nagriculture, optical \nphenomena, \ncryptography, steam \nengines, chemistry, \nastrology, and \ndemonology. He \nfounded the \nAccademia dei Segreti, \nwhich the Inquisition \nlater suppressed. \n\n\n\nMagic \n\nThough the church condemned magic as a devilish art, the Ages of \nFaith were filled with magical beliefs and practices. Magic was legal in \nRoman times; this tolerance continued through the early Middle \nAges, in some areas much longer than that. Sir Walter Raleigh praised \nmagic as a route to "virtues hidden in the center of the center." He \nsaid magic "bringeth to light the inmost virtues, and draweth them out \nof Nature\'s hidden bosom to human use." \' \n\nThe nobility including princes of the church supported court \nmagicians, astrologers, and diviners who helped them conduct their \naffairs. 2 Scholars carefully classified different types of magicians, as if to \ndistinguish the heretical from the acceptable. The "ancients" were \nrespected for their great magical wisdom. \n\nMixtures of tradition and confusion characterized nearly all the \nmanifestations of magic, especially the verbal charms and holy names \npopularly supposed to invoke supernatural powers necessary to the \n"working." A magician must recite defensive charms while enroute \nto the scene of a magical operation, such as: "Zazaii, Zamaii, Puidamon \nmost powerful, Sedon most strong, El, Yod He Vau He (the \ntetragrammaton), Iah, Agla, assist me an unworthy sinner who have \nhad the boldness to pronounce these Holy Names which no man \nshould name and invoke save in very great danger. Therefore have I \nrecourse unto these Most Holy Names, being in great peril both of \nsoul and of body. Pardon me if I have sinned in any manner, for I trust \nin Thy protection alone, especially on this journey." Proceedings \nwere usually opened with an "evocation," often involving a sacrifice to \nbe performed in a specific manner. The Grand Grimoire gives a \nsample: \n\nOn the third day of the moon, the witch or sorcerer will sever the head of \na virgin kid with one stroke, a clean cut. The kid will be garlanded with \nverbena and green ribbon beforehand and the sacrifice must take place far \naway from habitation. A clean, new knife is used; the celebrant must \nbare the right shoulder and keep a willow wood lire brightly aflame. \nSaying: "I offer this creature to three, O great Adonai, Elohim, Ariel \nandjehovas, in the honor and power and the resplendence of The Name, \nwhich is greater than all the spirits. O Great Adonai: agree to accept it \nas agreeable."* \n\nMagic books were full of charms in series, with assurances that if \none charm failed to call up the dread spirits, then surely the next one, \nbearing even more powerful names, would work. Demons who \nstubbornly refused to appear were threatened with eternal torments. \n\n\n\n566 \n\n\n\nI he frustrated magician played God and enchanted recalcitrant \nIpirits into deeper circles of hell. The silliness of the grimoires can only \nje appreciated through their own words; here in a series of invoca- \npns from the Lemegeton or Lesser Key of Solomon: \n\nO mighty and potent prince Samael, who art the ruler and governor of the \nfirst hour of the day by the decree of the Most High God, King of \nGlory; I, the servant of the Most High, do desire and entreat you by three \ngreat and potent names of God, Adonai, Aglaon, Tetragrammaton, \nand by the power and virtue thereof, to assist me in my affairs, and by your \npower and authority to send me, causing to appear before me, all or \nany of the angels whom I shall call by name, the same being resident \nunder your government. I do further entreat and require that they shall \nhelp me in all matters which accord with their office, even as I shall desire, \nand that they shall act for me as for the servant of the Most High. \nAmen. \n\nIf this legalistic contract failed to bind the demons, the magician \npmmonly resorted to threats: \n\nBecause thou art disobedient, and obeyst not my commandments nor the \nprecepts of the Lord thy God, now I, who am the servant of the Most \nHigh and Imperial Lord God of Hosts, Jehovah, having His celestial \npower and permission, for this thine averseness and contempt, thy great \ndisobedience and rebellion, will excommunicate thee, will destroy thy \nname and seal, and bury them in unending oblivion, unless thou \ncomest immediately, visibly and affably, here before this circle, within this \ntriangle, assuming a fair and comely form, without doing harm unto \nmyself or any creature whatsoever, but giving reasonable answer to my \nrequests and performing my desire in all things. \n\nSolemn magicians seem not to have realized the absurdity of \n! [(communicating a demon, who was hardly likely to be distressed by \nbvering relations with the church, since he had presumably severed \nclations with God already. Nevertheless, wizards were supplied with \n:pe following curse for excommunication: \n\nThou art still pernicious and disobedient, willing not to appear and inform \nme upon that which I desire to know; now therefore, in the Name and \nby the power and dignity of the Omnipotent and Immortal Lord God of \nHosts, Jehovah Tetragrammaton, sole Creator of Heaven, Earth, and \nHell, with all contained therein, the marvellous Disposer of all things \nvisible and invisible, I do hereby curse and deprive thee of all thine \noffice, power and place; I bind thee in the depth of the Bottomless Pit, \nthere to remain unto the Day of Judgment, in the Lake of Fire and \nBrimstone, prepared for the rebellious Spirits. May all the Company of \nHeaven curse thee; may the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, the Light of the \nHosts of heaven, curse thee into lire unquenchable, into torments un- \nspeakable; and even as thy name and seal are bound up in this box, to \nbe choked with sulphureous and stinking substances and to burn in this \nmaterial fire, so, in the name of Jehovah, and by the power and dignity \nof the three names, Tetragrammaton, Anexhexeton, Primematum, may \nall these drive thee, O thou disobedient Spirit N., into the Lake of Fire. \n\n\n\nMagic \n\n\n\nGrand Grimoire \n\nOne of the most \npopular Renaissance \ncollections of spells, \nexorcisms, \ninvocations, and \nmagical recipes. \n\n\n\n567 \n\n\n\nMagic The grimoires provided many excuses for failure. They required \n\ninfinite care in the manufacture of tools, with complicated charms and \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ debilitating purifications, fasting, and penance. Their lists of holy \n\nnames and words of power were lengthy and hard to remember and \nletter-perfect recitation was essential. The practice of magic was \nclearly beyond the grasp of the lazy, stupid, or illiterate. Unfortunately i \nwas also beyond the grasp of the credulous educated as well. \n\nA grimoire called the Little Albert gave an infallible formula for \nmaking a ring of invisibility, but the ring had to be plaited with three \nhairs from the head of a hyena. 6 Hyenas were scarce in Europe, but \neven if one could be found, its head hairs would prove too short to be \nplaited in a ring. Similarly impossible prescriptions appeared in all magi< \nbooks. The more infallible the charm, the more outrageously difficult \nits execution. \n\nFaith in magic was identical with faith in religion. Both depended \non hieratic ceremony and verbal incantation. Both involved prayer to \na superior power even the same power in both cases. Both used the \nname as a vehicle of appeal and coercion. The pious practiced magic \nno less than the impious by way of a thousand informal charms like the \nfollowing, advocated in 1785 to learn winning numbers in the \nFrench national lottery: \n\nLord Jesus Christ, Who hast said, "lam the Way, the Truth, and the \nLife, "for Thou hast cherished truth and hast shown me the secrets of \nThy wisdom whereby again this night the unknown things which are not \nrevealed save to the lowly shall be revealed to me, send me the angels \nUriel, Rubiel, and Barachiel to teach me which numbers I must choose k \nwin, by Him Who will come to judge the quick and the dead and the \ntimes by fire. 7 \n\nPeasant magic was usually crude, without the secret names and \nverbose invocations requiring a written recipe. Illiterate witches simply \nperformed acts of magic, like this rude country charm to cure \nlameness: \n\nTake hog\'s dung and charnell, and put them together and hold them in \nyour left hand, and take in the other hand a knife, and prick the \nmedicine three times, then cast the same into the tire, and take the said \nknife and make three pricks under a table, and let the knife stick there; \nand after that take three leaves of sage, and as many of herb John, and pui \nthem into ale, and drink it last at night and first in the morning. 8 \n\nA witch\'s patient testified that this procedure did indeed give her \n"ease of her lameness." We may laugh, but equally crude magic has \nbeen promulgated for profit in our own time, often by churches \nthemselves. In 1880, one of the leading churches in Philadelphia sold \nblessed candles with the guarantee that the purchaser would be \npreserved for one year from all disorders of the throat. A sermon was \npreached to this effect, and seven examples given of miraculous \ncures. 9 The mass of exploitable believers was still evident a century latei \n\n\n\n568 \n\n\n\n31 \n\n\n\nvVi \n\n\n\nin 1970, when an enterprising seer sold healing cloths by radio Magic \n\n: advertising: "I lay hands on a cloth," he said. "The healing power of \n\nGod which I received four years ago is passed on to the cloth which I ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nisend to you." 10 \n\nChristians practiced magic from the very beginning of the church. \n\nIsaac of Antioch complained in the 5 th century that not only the \n\npeople but clergymen also "carry about the incantations of the magi- \n\nicians; and instead of the holy cross, lo, they carry the books of devils . . . ; \ni b child carries about devils\' names and comes to church." u In other \n\nwords, pagan amulets were credited with as much protective power as \n\njChristian amulets. St. Jerome himself affirmed that a sapphire amulet \na [\'procures favor with princes, pacifies enemies, and obtains freedom \n\nifrom captivity." 12 \n\nChristian authorities said an amulet containing many secret names \nf God was sure to keep the bearer from any evil death. The cake of \nax called Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) was advertised by Pope Urban V \n\nas a sure protection against lightning, fire, and water; also a charm for \n|sasy childbirth and remittance of sins. Various charms were sold by the \n: church to preserve horses\' hoofs from cracks, to prevent disease, to \n\nenhance sexual potency. Girls wishing to grow long hair were told to \n\nhang locks of their hair before an image of St. Urbane. Christians had \n\nmalevolent charms too. It was believed that any man would die within a \n\nyear if the 108th Psalm was "said against" him by a priest. 13 The \n, Mass was credited with potent magical force for both good and evil uses. \n\nMasses were said for healing, for fertility, for magical protection of \nr livestock, houses, boats, etc.; they were also said to kill enemies. From \n\nthe 7th to the 1 5 th century, church literature spoke of priests who \n\ncould cause death by saying the Mass for the Dead against living \n\nfrsons. 14 \nUp to the 17th century it was still written that a dream revealing \n:he whereabouts of any stolen article could be obtained by placing \njnder one\'s pillow a wax tablet with the names of the Magi Jasper, \nMelchisor (sic), and Balthasar. Another kind of magical dream, to see \nthe face of one\'s future mate, could be had by putting a Bible under the \njpillow with a sixpence inserted in the Book of Ruth. 15 Many magic \n:harms invoked the names of apostles: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe devil is tying a knot in my leg! \n\nMark, Luke, and John, unloose it, I beg; \n\nCrosses three we make to ease us: \n\nTwo for the thieves, and one for Christ Jesus! 16 \n\n\n\nPriests often tried to impress simple folk by teaching them magic \n:harms. Ady\'s maid was given a charm to make butter come in the \n:hurn, by an old woman who said her mother had it from "a learned \nChurch man in Queen Maries days, when as church men had more \ncunning, and could teach people many a trick, that our Ministers \nnow a days know not." 17 Typical Christian magic included verbal \n\n\n\n569 \n\n\n\nMagna Dea charms to exorcise, heal, bless, or excommunicate; the wearing of \n\nMagog amulets such as crucifixes, St. Christopher medals, and scraps of the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m scriptural texts; the use of holy water; the invocation of saints; and of \n\ncourse the belief in miracles generally for "magic" and "miracle" \n\nwere but different words for the same idea. \n\n1.

"Ma" was merged with the Celtic mac to yield an \ninterpretation of "Gog, son of Gog." Gog and Magog were com- \nmonly used names for any pair of colossal figures, especially figures of \npagan deities. Yet, curiously, "Gog and Magog" appeared in Renais- \nsance magic books as two of the Ineffable Names of God. 2 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 253. 2.

His coming was so eagerly \npvaited that many historical Islamic leaders claimed to personify him. \nAfter Arabia was converted to Islam, it was usually supposed that \nthe Mahdi would be sent by Allah. But he was older than Islam.

Greek writers \ncalled Maia one of the Pleiades, but also understood that she was the \nGreat Goddess of Maytime festivals, of the renewal and rebirth of the \ndead.

She was also Mamata, spirit of "mine- \nness" or belonging, binding members of the same matrilineal clan \ntogether through the blood of mothers. 1 In Mesopotamia, she was \nMami or Mammitu or Mama, the Creatress who made mankind of clay \nand nourished her creatures with her own magic fluids. 2 \n\n1.

See \nCleopatra VII. \n\n\n\n| Mammon \n\nMedieval demon of commercial acquisitiveness, whose name meant \n"riches." In the Middle East, the original meaning of this name was the \nrich outpouring of the Great Goddess\'s inexhaustible breasts (mam- \nmae), which nourished all her children; Babylon named her Mami or \nMammitu (Mother), the biblical Mamre. Some Sumero-Babylonian \nscriptures called her "Mammetun the mother of destinies." \' \n\nJesus\'s precept, "Ye cannot serve God and Mammon" (Luke \n16: 1 3) meant a choice between God and Goddess, in a time when \nI her temples were richer and more magnificent than his. The Gospels \ndemanded that her shrines be destroyed and her wealth taken away, \nin an obviously jealous attack on the "Many-breasted" Goddess "whom \nall Asia and the world worshippeth" (Acts 19:27). Like the Oriental \nGoddess Earth (Artha, "riches"), she stood for material wealth because \nI her temples had a great deal of it and her soil was the ultimate source \nof all. 2 \n\nIt was the habit of demonologists to masculinize even Goddesses \nwhen they were diabolized and consigned to hell. Even Ashtoreth, or \nAstarte, was a male in hell. Much the same thing seems to have \nhappened to Mammetun: she became a "lord" of riches. Weyer \nmade her/him a dignitary of hell and an ambassador from hell to \nI England, probably a reflection of resentment of English \ncommercialism. 3 \n\n1. EpicofGilgamesh, 107. 2. Cavendish.

See Potter. \n\n\n\n573 \n\n\n\nMan \n\n\n\nThe Goddess-or- \nGod Mana-Anna, or \nMannanan, was \nmasculinized as a "son \nof Lir" of Sidh \nFinnaha. Lir however \nwas the same as \nShakespeare\'s King \nLear, who had three \ndaughters but no son. 10 \nThus, Shakespeare\'s \nsource seems to indicate \nthat this child of Lir \nwas originally the Triple \nGoddess, for one of \nthe so-called daughters, \nCordelia, was really \nCreiddylad, another \nname for the Fairy \nQueen. 11 \n\n\n\nMan \n\nIn the original Old Norse, man meant "woman." 1 The word for \n"man" was not man but wer, from the Sanskrit root viras in wer-wulf, \nthe man-wolf. 2 The name Man meant the Moon, creatress of all \ncreatures according to Scandinavian and other tribes throughout Eu- \nrope. Even in imperial Rome, Man or Mana was the mother of all \nmanes or ancestral spirits. The Sanskrit root man meant "moon" and \n"wisdom," both the primary attributes of the Great Goddess. 3 \n\nHeathen skalds composed a class of sacred love songs to the \nfeminine principle of the Moon and her earthly incarnation, woman; \nthese were mansongr, "woman-songs." They were expressly prohibited \nby the Catholic church. 4 \n\nThe Isle of Man was formerly sacred to the Moon-goddess, who \nwas sometimes a mermaid or an androgynous Aphrodite who kept \nmen\'s souls in "pots turned upside down" i.e., grave mounds and \nbeehive tombs. 5 Passage graves in East Jutland were full of upturned \npots, an Iron Age burial custom. 6 The same custom was mentioned in \nSouth America where the Moon carries souls away and places them \nunder upturned pots. 7 Apparently the Isle of Man used to be a sacred \nIsle of the Dead. The name of its deity was variously rendered Man, \nMana, Mana-Anna, or Manannan. \n\nThe island used to have an "enchanted palace" with a crypt or \nchapel of thirteen pillars, the sacred number of the old lunar year. \nEvery visitor was expected to count the pillars. If the counting ceremo- \nny was omitted, the visitor would be imprisoned in the crypt, which \nindicates a burial place sacred to the Moon. The site was later destroyed \nby "salt spilled on the ground," a reference to Christians\' habit of \nleveling pagan shrines and sowing the ground with salt to make it \ninfertile. \n\nThe Moon-goddess appeared in Manx legend as a Fairy Queen \nwho sometimes led the whole male population "into the sea, where \nthey perished." Most probably they perished first and were given to the \nsea-wornb as in the ancient Norse funeral rite. The Fairy Queen \nescaped annihilation by the priests when she took the form of a wren. \nBut pious Manxmen organized wren hunts, a custom followed every \nNew Year\'s Day thereafter, killing scores of the little birds in an effort to \nkill "Jenny Wren," the fairy. Feathers of the slain wrens were said to \npreserve sailors from shipwreck, and no Manx sailor would go to sea \nwithout one. 8 The wren hunts possibly were pre-Christian, with the \nlegend of the Fairy Queen invented for a new rationale. Before the \nmissionaries came, wrens probably were the "soul-birds" sacrificed to \nthe Goddess. Vallancey said the druids considered the wren supreme \namong all birds. "The superstitious respect shown to this bird gave \noffense to our first Christian missionaries, and by their commands he is \nstill hunted and killed by the peasants on Christmas Day, and on the \n\n\n\n574 \n\n\n\nfollowing (St. Stephen\'s Day) he is carried about hung by the leg, in the \nI center of two hoops crossing each other at right angles." 9 \n\nl.Steenstrup, 105. 2.

Mana came back into English via anthropolog- \nical studies in the South Pacific, where the word was described as \nfollows: \n\nMana is the stuff through which magic works . . . proceeding immediately \nfrom the nature of the sacred person or thing, or mediately because a \nghost or spirit has put it into the person or thing. . . . The cult of the relics \nof saints springs from the belief that their bodies, whether living or \ndead, possessed Mana. 3 \n\nMana also ruled the underworld, which the Finns called Man- \nala. 6 The Romans knew her as a very ancient Goddess Mana or Mania, \n| governing the underground land of the long dead: the ancestral spirits \ncalled manes, her children. They dwelt in a pit under the lapis manalis \nin the Forum, emerging to receive their offerings on the annual feast \nI day of the Maniae. 7 On this occasion the Goddess Mania appeared in a \nfright mask, like the terrifying Crone-face of Medusa or Destroying \nKali. 8 \n\nMania was not solely a spirit of death or madness, however, in \n\nclassical times. Her "moon-madness" or "lunacy" was viewed as a \n\nrevelation of the divine, to be received with gratitude. Socrates said, \n\n"The greatest of our blessings come to us through mania. . . . \n\nMadness coming from [the deity] is superior to sanity of human \n\norigin." 9 In other words, Mana-Mania was the Muse. Gnostics said \n\nMana is "the divine spirit in man"; and the Great Mana, or Mana of \n\nI Glory, is "the highest godhead." 10 \n\n1. Briffault 2, 602. 2. Steenstrup, 105. 3.

Mania \n\nMana may be \ncompared to Hindu \nMaya, the Virgin \nGoddess whose name \nwas "power," and \nArabic Manat, the \nVirgin Goddess \nwhose name was "fate" \nand who represented \nthe Triple Moon. 1 In \narchaic Europe, \nMana was the Moon- \nmother who gave \nbirth to the race of \nman that is, of \nwoman, which is what \nman originally \nmeant. 2 \n\nMana or Mania \nbecame a common \nname for the Great \nGoddess as Creatress \nand Queen of \nHeaven (moon), \nbecause it was \nintimately connected \nwith the mysterious \npowers of women, like \nthe moon itself. \nScandinavians called \nthe Goddess\'s sky- \nrealm Manavegr, "the \nMoon\'s Way." 4 \nCelts called it E-Mania, \nor Hy Many, the \nland ruled by the Triple \nGoddess. Sometimes \nit was Emain Macha, \nthe moon-land of \nMother Macha. \nCormac\'s Glossary \n\n\n\n575 \n\n\n\nManasa-Devi \nManicheans \n\n\n\nManasa-Devi \n\nSerpent Goddess of Bengal, identified with the moon, bearing the \nmoon\'s magic name Mana. \n\n\n\nMana . . . \n\nsaid ema meant "blood\' \n(compare the \nSemitic ima, "mother," \nand dam, meaning \nboth "mother" and \n"blood"). Emain, \ntherefore, was the \ncountry of the Great \nMother\'s regenerative \nlunar blood. 5 \n\n\n\nManat \n\nArabic Moon-goddess, ruler of Fate: thus her name is still a synonym \nfor Luck or Fortune. She was venerated in a sacred stone at Kodaid in \npre-Islamic times, and was one of the trinity of Fates worshipped at \nMecca. See Arabia. \n\n\n\nMandala \n\nOriental sacred diagram or meditation symbol, usually circular, some- \ntimes square, sometimes another regular shape, such as the \nEight- Petaled Lotus of Smashana-Kali.

Almonds were holy symbols because of their female, yonic \nconnotations. Almonds had the power of virgin motherhood, as shown \nby the myth of Nana, who conceived the god Attis with her own \nalmond. 1 The candlestick of the Jews\' tabernacle of the Ark was \ndecorated with almonds for their fertility magic (Exodus 25:33-34). \nChristian art similarly used the mandorla as a frame for figures of God, \nJesus, and saints, because the artists forgot what it formerly meant. \n\nl.Frazer.G.B.,403. \n\n\n\n576 \n\n\n\nManicheans \n\nGnostic Christian sect, a leading rival of the early orthodoxy. \nSt. Augustine was a Manichean for over a decade, before he was \nconverted to orthodoxy and began writing arguments against the \nprecepts of his former teachers. 1 \n\nFounder of the Manichean sect was the third-century Persian \nprophet Manes or Mani, whose legend claimed he was another \nincarnation of Christ. He was born of a holy virgin named Mariham, or \nMar Mariam, "the Lady Mary," whose title was "Mother of the Life \nof the Whole World." 2 He performed the usual feats of every Savior: \npreached, healed the sick, exorcised demons, collected twelve disci \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI pies, and eventually suffered martyrdom. He was crucified and flayed by \n\njthe Persian king, perhaps as a ritual surrogate. 3 \n\nMani\'s central doctrine was puritanical. The material world was \n\nI the work of the devil, who invented sex to entrap ethereal souls in the \n\nprison of flesh: the same view was held by the Essenes. Mani\'s \n\n\'followers abstained from sex, and also from animal food, even eggs, \n\n|believing that all flesh was evil if begotten by copulation. They ate fish, \n\nI pretending that fish do not reproduce sexually but are spontaneously \n\nIjengendered from "living water." Christians\' adoption of the Aphrodi- \n\njtean fish symbol for Christ may have been a Manichean idea. 4 \n\nAccording to Mani, the devil who created this world of gross \n\n[matter was the Jewish Jehovah. He said: "It is the Prince of Darkness \n\nIwho spoke with Moses, the Jews, and their priests. Thus the Christians, \n\nithe Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they \n\nworship this God. For he led them astray in the lusts that he taught \n\npern." 5 Like Jesus, Mani faced this same demon-god on a moun- \n\nfltaintop and resisted his temptation. The demon-god offered Jesus "all \n\nflthe kingdoms of the earth" in return for a single act of worship, \n\nmplying that all the kingdoms of the earth belonged to the devil, who \n\ncould dispose of them as he pleased (Matthew 4:9). Jesus refused the \n\nbffer, and so did Mani. \n\nManicheans naturally aroused the ire of orthodox Christians by \n\nballing their God a devil. Eusebius fairly frothed with indignation at \n\njpese heretics: "Mani presumed to represent the person of Christ; he \n\n(proclaimed himself to be the Comforter, and the Holy Ghost, and \n\nbeing puffed up with this frantic pride, chose, as if he were Christ, \n\ntwelve partners of his new-found doctrine, patching into one heap \n\nfelse and detestable doctrines of old, rotten, and rooted out heresies, the \n\n|*rhich he brought out of Persia." 6 \n\nThis was wishful thinking on Eusebius\'s part. The heresy was not \n\nlooted out. The Manichean idea of the Catholic demon-Jehovah was \n\no recur again and again through the Middle Ages, in sects like the \n\n3athari, Paulicians, Albigensians, Bogomils, and many others. In \n\n/iew of the sufferings of these people at the hands of Catholic Rome, \n\nheir premise seemed not unfounded. One historian said the Mani- \n\n:hean heresy was conquered only by "massacre and violence at first, \n\nind afterward by organized terrorism." 7 So terrible were the persecu- \n\nions that Lea said, "If the blood of the martyrs were really the seed of \n\nChurch, Manicheism would now be the dominant religion of \n\nrope." 8 \n\nl.Reinach,76. 2.

When the great herds \nwere killed and left to rot, many Indian tribes died of famine. This \nwas hailed as a working of Manifest Destiny. 1 \n\nIt was also part of Manifest Destiny that the Indians must be \nconverted to the conquerors\' religion. They didn\'t like that either. In \n1805 a Seneca chief told a missionary: "Brother, we do not wish to \ndestroy your religion, or take it from you; we only want to enjoy our \nown. Brother, we are told that you have been preaching to white people \nin this place . . .; we will wait a little while and see what effect your \npreaching has upon them.

The \nmyth signified male usurpation of the priestesses\' functions of magic \nand prophecy, at first by transvestism and/or castration to turn men into \npseudo-women; Teiresias was made female and lived for seven years \nas a temple harlot, which gave him his divinatory powers. 1 The Mantes \neventually came to include male priests, then to consist of a wholly \nmale priesthood.

Like the Muses who gave Greek poets \nthe gift of words, the Mother Goddesses or matrikadevis gave \nSanskrit poets the secret of mantras, by which the gods themselves coul< \nbe controlled. 2 \n\nThe matrikamantra or Mother of Mantras was Kali\'s Word of \nCreation Om, meaning her own "pregnant belly" and perhaps \n\n\n\n578 \n\n\n\nstemming from the grunting exhalation of a woman in childbirth; for Mantra \n\nOm was the word Kali uttered in giving birth to the universe. 3 The \n\nsecond most famous Tantric mantra, Om manipadme hum, Jewel in ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe Lotus, referred to the Lord of the universe contained within the \n\nGoddess. \n\nHindus believed anything could be accomplished if one only knew \nthe correct mantras. Compendia like the Tantrasara gave "prayers, \nMantras and Dharanis to protect against every form of evil, against the \nbad Spirits, wild beasts, natural calamities, human enemies, and so \nforth which were said to be effective, provided that they were applied in \nthe proper disposition and at the right time and in the right manner." \nTo produce the desired effect, "the Mantra must be intoned in the \nproper way, according to both sound (Varna) and rhythm (Svara)." \nTherefore a Mantra loses its efficacy when translated into another \nlanguage. 4 \n\nThe same belief led the Catholic church to retain Latin as its \nliturgical tongue, 1 500 years after Latin ceased to exist in the mouths \nof ordinary folk. Like Brahman priests with their God-controlling \nmantras, church fathers thought the very sound of the words had \nbeen invested with magic power at the see of St. Peter; so translation of \nthe Latin would rob the words of their power to make God act. 5 This \nsuperstition forced Christian laymen to listen, century after century, to \nchurch services of which they couldn\'t understand a single word. \n\nThe idea of the mantra wasn\'t introduced into Rome by Chris- \ntians; it was there already. Pagan Romans believed, as Virgil said, that \nthe right words, rightly spoken, could draw the moon down from the \nsky. A ritual of "drawing down the moon" is still practiced by modern \n"witches." 6 By the power of her words, a Roman priestess could "arrest \nthe flow of rivers and turn back the stars in their courses; she \nsummons the nocturnal spirits; you will see the ground rumble beneath \nher feet; and the ash trees descend from the mountains." 7 \n\nAll liturgies were basically mantras, evolved from the primitive \nI theory that human words could make things happen in the supernat- \nural realm, which in turn influenced the natural one. An example is the \n| idea of praying souls out of Purgatory, where "mantras" alone \nproduce the result even though the result is unverifiable. This also had \nTantric precedents. Tibetan lamas still circumvent their own law \nagainst eating animal flesh by eating it anyway, to the accompaniment \nof a mantra that will assure the eaten animal\'s rebirth in heaven. 8 \nThus the offended creature is placed, by human words, in a blessed \nsituation where he can no longer take offense. Naturally, mantras of \nsuch marvelous power are revealed only with great care, by qualified \ngurus to tested candidates worthy to become Guardians of the \nMysteries. 9 \n\nl.Avalon,493. 2.

Manu\'s ark, loaded with the \nseeds of every plant and a pair of every kind of animal, tied up to the \nSerpent\'s horn and so survived the watery chaos between the destruc- \ntion of one universe and the creation of the next. 1 \n\nManu\'s ark was the cosmic seed-vessel, in pre- Vedic myth the \nwomb of the Goddess, which preserved the spark of life through \ncycles of destruction and renewal. It seems Manu was a masculinized \nform of Ma-Nu or Mother Night, the name she bore in Egypt, as the \nspirit of the primordial abyss that gave birth to the cosmos. Sumerians \nknew her as Nammu, "the primeval ocean, the mother of the gods." 2 \n\nThe archaic notion of Manu as a Creatress also attributed to her \nthe foundation of morality and law; hence the scriptures that Vedic \nsages called the Laws of Manu, frequently rewritten and augmented by \npatriarchal Brahman and Buddhist philosophies. However, Manu \nremained sexually ambiguous, like Egypt\'s Ma-Nu or Nu or Nun, who \nsometimes took the form of a great Fish who gave birth to the gods. 3 \nNu was translated into Hebrew as Noah. Significantly, this name was \nthe "Fish" without the sexually definitive mother-syllable Ma. \n\nVedic sages came to believe in Manu as a kind of Adam, the \nprogenitor of the human race, incestuously begotten by the Brahman \ncreator upon his own daughter a reversal of the archaic myth of the \nprimal creatress who made, then mated with, her Great Serpent. So \nmany different acts, myths, laws, and customs were attributed to the \nauthority of Manu that this personage multiplied into 14 different \nManus, avatars or reincarnations of the same Manu in different ages of \nthe world. 4 This may have been a re-interpretation of the original \nidea of successive universes, with the dark mother-womb bridging the \nperiods of watery chaos between them by preserving the seeds of \nfuture life. \n\n\\.

The name and its variants may be found from India to northern \nEurope. Buddhists translated the name as Fear-of-Death, and com- \nbined it with Kama, Erotic-Desire, to create the demon who tempted \nBuddha to abandon his meditation before he achieved true knowl- \nedge of Nirvana. 1 This "temptation in the wilderness" scene was \nreplayed over and over in subsequent legends of ascetic Saviors, such \nas Mani and Jesus. \n\nThe gypsies, with their traditions rooted in Hinduism, knew Mara \nto be the death goddess who trapped the soul of the Enchanted \n\n\n\n580 \n\n\n\nHuntsman in a mirror, and caused his death a myth that paralleled Mardoll \n\nancient Pelasgian stories of the death of Dionysus. 2 Marduk \n\nThe Slavs said Mara or Mora was a destructive female spirit who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n"drank the blood of men" by night. 3 She became the mare or Night- \nmare, "A monstrous hag squatting upon the breast mute, motionless \nand malignant; an incarnation of the evil spirit whose intolerable \nweight crushes the breath out of the body." 4 This was the same image \nassumed by black Kali the Destroyer, whose death aspect meant \n"passive weight and darkness." 5 \n\nSemitic peoples associated Mara or Marah with the "passive \nweight and darkness" of the deep sea-womb; thus the name was \nsometimes translated "briny" or "bitter." Marah was the name assumed \nby the matriarch Naomi (Ruth 1 :20) as she passed into the Crone \nstage of her life. An old shrine of the goddess Mara was the Old \nTestament\'s Maralah, "a place of trembling" (Joshua 19:1 1), possibly \na necropolis. The biblical death-curse Maranatha (1 Corinthians 16:22) \nalso invoked the destroying Goddess. Mari was another version of \nher name, as in Kel-Mari (Kali the Pot Goddess, who made mankind \nout of clay), Marici the Goddess "clothed with the sun," Yamamari, \na combination of Mari with Yama or "Death," and Mari-Amma the \nDeath-giver, in Hebrew Mariamne, Miriam, or Mary. \n\n1.

Marduk also killed the first- \nborn God, Kingu, and created the first man from Kingu\'s blood a \nmyth remembered by the Arabs, who said Allah made man from \nflowing blood. 1 Marduk also inherited the tablets of sacred law that the \nMother Goddess had given her elder, favorite son. These same \ntablets were entrusted to Babylonian kings by presentation on the holy \n\n\n\n\n\n\n581 \n\n\n\nMarea "mountain" of the ziggurat.

Mari was the same Goddess later wor- \nshipped in Israel as a consort of Yahweh. 1 \n1. Graves, W.G, 439. \n\n\n\nMare Nostrum \n\n"Our sea," or "Our mother"; Roman title of the Mediterranean, or \n"Middle-of-the-Earth Sea." All seas were maria, "Marys," symbolized \nby the Goddess in her blue robe, sometimes a mer-maid (literally, \nSea- Virgin), often named Aphrodite Marina. See Mary. \n\n\n\nMargaret, Saint \n\nMythical "virgin martyr" who never existed as a Christian but was a \ncanonized form of Aphrodite Marina, Pelagia, or Margarita, called Pearl \nof the Sea. 1 Originally she was a yonic Goddess representing Aphro- \ndite\'s "Pearly Gate," which, like the Jade Gate of the Chinese Great \nMother, meant the genital entrance to paradise. The name Margaret \nmay be traced to Sanskrit Marga, "the Gate" or "the Way," i.e., the \nyonic gate of Kali-Shakti leading through ritual sexuality to the \nparadise of Tantric sages. 2 \n\nHagiographers invented several legends of Margaret-Pelagia-Mari- \nna, all names of the pagan Sea-goddess. Sometimes she was a virgin \nwho suddenly turned Christian on her wedding day and so renounced \nher bridegroom, the "sinful riotings" of the wedding feast, and the \njoys of married life which she decided were worthless as "dung." \nSometimes she was a divine harlot, the wealthiest and most beautiful \nwoman in Antioch, covered with gold, silver, and gems, who suddenly \nturned Christian and gave away all her possessions to poor folk \n(Christians, of course), and allowed a bishop to impose on her a hard life \nof penance. 3 This legend was a favorite of early saint-makers, who \nparticularly resented promiscuous women and invariably coveted their \nill-gotten gains. \n\nOne legend made St. Margaret the daughter of a pagan priest. She \nspurned her rich suitor, Olybrius, governor of Antioch, and devoted \nherself to Christian virginity. She was subjected to amazing tortures to = \n\n\n\n582 \n\n\n\novercome her determination. "All her bones were laid bare, and the Margawse \n\nblood poured forth from her body as from a pure spring." 4 But she still \n\nhad strength enough to conquer the devil, who took the form of a ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ngreat dragon and swallowed her, whereupon she caused his body to \n\nburst and stepped forth "unharmed" except of course for the harm \n\nthat had already been done by her various tortures. After this she was \n\nburned, drowned, and beheaded: St. Margaret was very hard to kill. \n\nAnother legend of St. Margaret said she fled from her suitor to \nbecome a holy hermit. She joined a monastery of ascetics, disguising \nherself as a monk, "Brother Pelagius." In this connection one might \nrecall the rule of early Syrian churches, that no women would be \npermitted to become Christians unless they "made themselves male." 5 \nMargaret made herself male so successfully that she was accused of \nseducing a nun, subjected to severe penances which she accepted \nhumbly, and finally vindicated only after death, when those who \ncame to prepare her body for burial discovered that she had been a \nwoman. \n\nUnder her other name of Pelagia, before she became the monk \nPelagius, Margaret devoted her early life to "lewd" worship of \nAphrodite as a temple harlot. On being converted to Christianity, she \ncalled herself "a sea of wickedness overflowing with the waves of sin \n... an abyss of perdition ... a quagmire and pitfall of souls." 6 The feast \nday of this Margaret- Pelagia was the same as that of St. Thais, \nanother mythical version of the same courtesan-turned-Christian, the \nsecond most popular type of female saint, after the "virgin martyr." \n\nSince Margaret was fundamentally an incarnation of Aphrodite, \nspouse of Adonis "the Lord" at Bethlehem, it would be expected that \nshe remain the spouse of "the Lord"; and accordingly her worshippers \nsaid, "Blessed art thou O Margaret the spouse of Christ." 7 \n\nThrough all her appearances as virgin, harlot, monk, and so on, \nhowever, Margaret remained what the pagan Goddess always was: \nthe primary patron of childbearing women. \n\nl.Attwater,228. 2.

Margawse \nwas the same as the Latin Anna, the Mother of the Year: she gave \nbirth to the four Aeons, named Gareth, Gaheris, Agravine, and Ga- \nwain. She also mated with her brother Arthur and brought forth \n[Arthur\'s nemesis, sister-son, son, tanist, and supplanter: Mordred, \nwhom Arthur tried to kill in his infancy. As Fate or perhaps \n[Margawse herself decreed, Mordred lived to grow up and destroy \n[Arthur. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n583 \n\n\n\nMan \n\n\n\nMari \n\n\n\nMany place names \nevolved from Marian \nshrines. Among \nthem were Amari or \nAy-Mari, the \nCyprian home of \nAphrodite Marina; \nMarib, City of the \nMoon, seat of the \nqueens of Sheba; Marea \nin western Egypt; \nMaronea near Lake \nIsmaris; Maru, \nmother-city of the \nMedes; Sa-Maria, a \ncountry whose name \nmeant literally "holy \nblood of Mary." 2 One \nof the entrances to \nher underworld womb, \na sacred cave \naccessible only by sea, \nwas Mar-Mari, \n"Mother Sea." 3 \n\nSometimes the deity \nwas named simply Mer, \nan Egyptian word for \nboth "waters" and \n"mother-love." 6 \nMer was also a \ncomponent of the \nnames of Egyptian \nqueens in the first \ndynasty. One of Egypt\'s \noldest names was Ta- \nMera, Land of the \nWaters, which could \nalso be interpreted as a \nLand of the Great \nMothers. 7 \n\nNorthern Europe \nknew the same Goddess \nas Maerin, wedded \nto Thor at her shrine in \nTrondheim. H To \nthe Saxons she was \nWudu-Maer: \n\n\n\nBasic name of the Goddess known to the Chaldeans as Marratu, to \nthe Jews as Marah, to the Persians as Mariham, to the Christians as \nMary: as well as Marian, Miriam, Mariamne, Myrrhine, Myrtea, \nMyrrha, Maria, and Marina. Her blue robe and pearl necklace were \nclassic symbols of the sea, edged with pearly foam. 1 \n\nThe Goddess\'s Amorite city of Mari was one of the wonders of the \nancient world. Its six-acre temple-palace astonished archeologists who \nuncovered it in the 1930s. Mari dominated the area now known as the \nHoly Land until it fell to the armies of Hammurabi in 1700 b.c. 4 \n\nSemites worshipped an androgynous combination of Goddess and \nGod called Mari-El (Mary-God), corresponding to the Egyptian \nMeri-Ra which combined the feminine principle of water with the \nmasculine principle of the sun. 5 \n\nThe Syrian version of Mari or Meri was worshipped in combina- \ntion with her serpent-consort Yamm, derived from Yama, the Hindu \nLord of Death. Yamm alternated with Baal, "the Lord," as the \nGoddess\'s favorite and a sovereign over heaven and the abyss. Indian \nYama was one of the consorts of Kel-Mari, as Kali was called in the \nsouth. 8 Tantric Buddhists still speak of the "Slayer of the Death \nKing," Yama-Mari, who was identified with the Dalai Lama. 9 Jews and \nearly Christians used the same combination of names, Mari- Yamm or \nMariam, for the mother of Jesus. 10 \n\nThe spirit of the archaic Mari entered into Babylonian diviners \nknown as mare baruti, sea-mothers, who operated in the bit mummu \nor womb-chamber, where statues of the gods were said to be "born" \n(made animate). 11 In similar womb-chambers the Hindu goddess was \nworshipped as Kau-Mari or Kel-Mari. 12 She is still invoked as Marici- \nTara, the Diamond Sow on the Lotus Throne, "Glorious One, the \nsun of happiness." She is the Goddess "whose mayik vesture is the \nsun," forerunner of the Gospels\' "woman clothed with the sun" \n(Revelation 12:1), who was identified with the virgin Mary. 13 \n\nShe was also the Great Fish who gave birth to the gods, later the \nMermaid, Mare-mynd, mareminde, marraminde, maraeman, or \nmereminne. 20 \n\nIn short, she was always Mother Sea. Her Latin name was Maria, \n"the Seas." St. Peter Chrysologus called her Christian incarnation, \nthe virgin Mary, "the gathering together of the waters." 21 But she was \nalso the earth and heavens, since her earliest form was a trinity. She \nwas worshipped in pre- Roman Latium as Marica, mother of the first \nking Latinus, who was also her priapic goat-footed consort Faunus. \nShe was probably the same Goddess worshipped by the Slavs under the \nname of Marzanna (Mari-Anna), who "fostered the growth of \nfruits." 22 \n\nMari and her pagan consort were incongruously canonized as a \npair of Christian saints, Addai and Mari (Adonis and Aphrodite- \nMari). Their legends called them "bishops" dispatched to Aphrodite\'s \n\n\n\n584 \n\n\n\ncult center at Edessa, probably because their portraits appeared there, \nand it was easier to Christianize them than to destroy them. \n\nTheir cult began with Nestorian Christians who called them "Holy \nApostles Addai and Mari." 23 Another Christianization was St. \nMaura, from the Goddess\'s Fate-name Moera, "older than Time." 24 \nAs the Fate-spinner who held men\'s destinies in her hand, she \ngenerated a taboo: on St. Maura\'a day, women were forbidden to spin \nor sew. 25 \n\nMedieval Spain knew the Goddess Mari as a "Lady" or "Mistress" \nwho lived in a magic cave and rode through the night sky as a ball of \nfire. 26 This may have meant the red harvest moon, or possibly the moon \nin eclipse always a dire omen. The Goddess Mari was said to give \ngifts of fairy gold and precious stones, which might turn into worthless \nlumps of coal by the light of day. 27 In later centuries, the same \nworthless gifts were given to "bad" children by St. Nicholas at \nChristmas. \n\nThe island of Inis Maree had a ruined temple, sacred to a certain \n"St. Mourie" none other than the Goddess Mari for whom the \nisland was named. In 1678 the Presbytery of Dingwall "disciplined" \nsome people who sacrified bulls to the divinity of Loch Maree on the \n25th of August, a day dedicated to Aphrodite-Mari for more than 1 500 \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nyears. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Because the Goddess\'s pa- \ntronage was constantly invoked in every aspect of marriage, Christian \nfathers were opposed to the institution. Origen declared, "Matrimony is \nimpure and unholy, a means of sexual passion." St. Jerome said the \nprimary purpose of a man of God was to "cut down with an ax of \nVirginity the wood of Marriage." l St. Ambrose said marriage was a \ncrime against God, because it changed the state of virginity that God \ngave every man and woman at birth. 2 Marriage was prostitution of \n\ne members of Christ, and "married people ought to blush at the state \nwhich they are living." Tertullian said marriage was a moral crime, \n\nmore dreadful than any punishment or any death." It was spurcitiae, \n\nobscenity," or "filth." 5 \n\nSt. Augustine flatly stated that marriage is a sin. Tatian said \n\n\n\nliterally, a Wood-Mary, \nor Goddess of the \nGrove. To the Celts she \nwas Maid Marian, \nbeloved by Robin, the \nwitches\' Horned \nGod. Their greenwood \ncult caused church \nauthorities considerable \ntrouble in the 14th \ncentury. 15 \n\nMari was the same \nMerian or Merjan \nworshipped in Persia as \nQueen of the Peris \n(Fairies). 16 Iran had its \nmother goddess \nMariana from very \nancient times. 17 She \nmight be traced to the \nland of Akkad, \ncreated by a Goddess \ncalled the Lady \nMarri, Mother of the \nWorld. 18 A king of \nMari in 2500 B.C., \nunited with the \nGoddess, took the royal \nname of Lamki- \nMari. 19 \n\nSt. Peter \n\nChrysologus (Peter \nGolden-word) Fifth- \ncentury bishop of \nRavenna, friend of \nPope Leo the Great. \nThree centuries after \nhis death, a collection of \n1 76 sermons was \nproduced, and \nattributed to him, \nthough mostly spurious. \nHe was made a \ndoctor of the church in \n1729. \n\n\n\n585 \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, ex- \nerting a powerful \ninfluence on the early \nGreek church. At \nfirst he was accounted a \nsaint, but three cen- \nturies after his death he \nwas declared a here- \ntic because of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\nTertullian (Quintus \nSeptimius Florens \nTertullianus) \ninfluential early \nChristian writer and \nfather of the church, ca. \n1 5 5-220 a.d., born in \nCarthage of pagan \nparents. \n\n\n\nmarriage is corruption, "a polluted and foul way of life." Influenced \nby him, Syrian churches ruled that no person could become Christian \nexcept celibate men, and no man who had ever been married could \nbe baptized. Saturninus said God made only two kinds of people, good \nmen and evil women. Marriage perpetuated the deviltry of women, \nwho dominated men through the magic of sex. 4 Centuries later, St. Ber- \nnard still proclaimed that it was easier for a man to bring the dead \nback to life than to live with a woman without endangering his soul. 5 \n\nSt. Paul damned marriage with faint praise, remarking that to \nmarry was only better than to burn (1 Corinthians 7:9); but later \nfollowers of Pauline Christianity damned marriage altogether, according \nto the word of Jesus: "If any man come to me, and hate not his \nfather, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, \nyea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple" (Luke 14:26). \nJesus renounced his family, declaring that he had no relatives except the \nfaithful (Mark 3:31-35). Jerome interpreted this as a mandate to \ndestroy marriage and the family. He was disgusted by motherhood: "the \ntumefaction of the uterus, the care of yelling infants, all those fond \nfeelings which death at last cuts short." 6 He said every man who loves \nhis wife passionately was guilty of adultery. 7 Augustine also expressed \ndisgust at feminine sexual and maternal functions. He coined the saying \nthat birth is demonstrably accursed because every child emerges \n"between feces and urine." 8 \n\nAn example of anti-family virtue was made of one of the artificial \nsaints built on a title of the pro-family Goddess, Perpetua, "the \nEternal One." In her new Christian disguise as St. Perpetua, she was so \ndevoted to single blessedness that she not only faced martyrdom with \nequanimity but also renounced her parents, her husband, and her \nsuckling infant in order to become Christian. Her pagan relatives \ntried to soften her heart by putting the infant to her breast, but she threw \nit aside and said to them, "Begone from me, enemies of God, for I \nknow you not!" 9 \n\nThis was the early Christian notion of a "good" woman: one who \nplaced faith before family. Church customs reflected this view. There \nwas no Christian sacrament of marriage until the 16th century. 10 \nCatholic scholars say the wedding ceremony was "imposed on" a \nreluctant church, and "nothing is more remarkable than the tardiness \nwith which liturgical forms for the marriage ceremony were \nevolved." It is perhaps not remarkable to find that these liturgical forms \nwere not evolved by the church at all, but borrowed from pagans\' \ncommon law. 11 \n\nThe Anglican marriage service came from Anglo-Saxon deeds \nused to transfer a woman\'s land to the stewardship of her "house- \nman" (husband). The original wording had the bridegroom say: "With \nthis ring I thee wed and this gold and silver I give thee and with my \nbody I thee worship, and with all my worldly chattels I thee honor." \nThe bride responded: "I take thee to my wedded husband, to have \n\n\n\n586 \n\n\n\nbnd to hold, for fairer for fouler, for better for worse, for richer for Marriage \n\npoorer, in sickness and in health, to be bonny and buxom in bed and \n\njat board, till death us depart [sic]." A curious clerical note made in the ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmargin at a later date, explained that "bonny and buxom" really \n\nmeant "meek and obedient." 12 \n\nAbout wedding ceremonies in Greece and the Balkans, an author- \nity on Greek religion wrote: "With the modern Greeks as with other \nEuropeans, the religious service of their church is intrusive, no real part \npf the ceremony of marriage, but an elaborate way of calling down a \nplessing on the ceremonial, or what is left of it, which constitutes the \nreal wedding." 13 \n\nThe Christian priesthood was fighting ancient traditions in which it \nwas remembered that male spiritual authority was dependent on \nmarriage: either a hieros gamos between the ruler of a land and his \nGoddess, or the mandatory husbandship of priests who were not \nallowed to contact the deities unless they had wives. In Asia, the gods \nthemselves had to be married. Even patriarchal figures like Vishnu \nand Brahma needed their Shaktis or wives who embodied their power, \nand "without whom they avail nothing." H Brahman priests couldn\'t \nperform certain ceremonies without wives. 15 Oriental mystics taught \nthat any man was spiritually incomplete until he experienced bha- \n\n\n\nvanan, "husbandship," which linked him to the Goddess as Bhavani or \nI Existence." 16 The implication was that an unmarried man does not \ntruly exist. Tantric hymns said all women are goddesses because they \nembody the spirit of the Goddess; thus "women are Life itself." 17 \n\nEarly Israelites also barred unmarried men from the priesthood. \nThey thought a priest\'s spells and invocations would be powerless if \nhe had no wife. 18 Jewish scriptures said, "The man who has neither wife \nnor children is disgraced in the world and is hated by them, like a \nleafless and fruitless tree." 19 Similarly, the spiritual authority of Rome\'s \n[ligh priest the Flamen Dialis depended on his marriage to the \nplaminica, high priestess of Juno. If she died or left him, he immediately \njost his holy office. 20 \n\nSo much depended on a man\'s ability to remain married, in the \n:t ancient times, that the first rules of marriage invented by men \nm to have been rules for insuring permanent monogamy. Thus a \niband could hold on to a woman\'s property and children by \nding the woman herself. Matriarchal societies seldom permitted \nual jealousy. Women were free to change lovers or husbands, to \nake polyandrous or group marriages. Myths record the transition from \noose, flexible marital arrangements favored by Goddesses to the rigid \nnonogamy favored by Gods. \n\nThe pre-Hellenic Mother of God, Rhea, condemned monogamy \nis a sin and insisted on her ancient law of group marriage. Her son \neus defied her, on behalf of patriarchal invaders of her lands. He \nreed Rhea\'s "daughter" Hera actually another form of Rhea \nerself into a monogamous union, though he never stuck to his own \n\n\n\no \n\n\n\n587 \n\n\n\nMarriage side of the bargain. He was constantly adulterous, and Hera detested \n\nhim. On one occasion she roused the other gods in a rebellion against \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ him. Zeus punished her by hanging her from the sky with anvils \n\nattached to her ankles perhaps the first divine precedent permitting \nmen to torture wives into submission. 21 \n\nHellenic Greeks believed that men should seize every possible \nadvantage in forcing wives to be obedient and (especially) faithful. \nAristotle taught that a husband should be more than twice his bride\'s \nage he 37, she 18 so he could dominate her: "The elder and full \ngrown is superior to the younger and more immature." 22 Greek \npatriarchy foreshadowed the patriarchal religion which, "in the form \nseen in Judaism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism, is basically noth- \ning other than a formalization, by means of a projection upon deities, \nand the demand for obedience to their revealed command, of the \nfather\'s desired sexual control of his wives and of their female \nchildren, and the forcible exclusion of male children from sexual \nactivity." 23 \n\nThe Greeks\' contempt for wives eventually led to their cult of \nhomosexual romance, ignoring their families and taking young boys \nfor true-love relationships. Some scholars say this belittling of marriage \nwas founded on fear of women: \n\nThe Greek male\'s contempt for women was not only compatible with, but \nalso indissolubly bound to, an intense fear of them, and to an underly- \ning suspicion of male inferiority. Why else would such extreme measures \nbe necessary? Customs such as the rule that a woman should not be \nolder than her husband, or of higher social status, or more educated, or \npaid the same as a male for the same work, or be in a position of \nauthority betray an assumption that males are incapable of competing \nwith females on an equal basis; the cards must first be stacked, the \nfemale given a handicap. 24 \n\nObserving group marriages among their neighbors, the Greeks \nregarded such customs as barbaric or unusual. In an age when the \nGreeks were almost the only people with a patriarchal-monogamous \nsocial structure, a Greek said to the Spartan wife of Leonidas: "You of \nLacedaemon are the only women in the world that rule the men." \nShe retorted: "We are the only women who bring forth men." 25 \n\nDespite their pretense that their own system was the only normal \none, Greek writers like Herodotus knew the Arabs were polyandrous, \nthe Scythians shared spouses and children communally, the Lycians \nrecognized only matrilineal inheritance, and the Agathyrsi "cohabit \nin common with the women, in order that they should all be blood kin \nand that their family relationships should prevent them from harbor- \ning envy and hostility toward one another." 26 \n\nCaesar said group marriage was the rule in Britain. An indicator of \nthe group-marriage system among the Celts was the multiple paterni- \nty of many of their mythic heroes. Clothru, queen of Connaught, \nmarried three brothers at once, the same kind of fraternal polyandry \n\n\n\n588 \n\n\n\nI practiced by such eastern peoples as the Todas and the Singhalese. 27 Marriage \n\nThe Nairs practiced group marriage up to the 19th century. Hindu \n\nliterature speaks of a princess who married five brothers at once, and was ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nblessed by the Goddess Cunti, and promised many children. 28 In the \nI Mahabharata, a speech to the same Goddess Cunti told of "the practice \nof old indicated by illustrious Rishis fully acquainted with every rule \nof morality": \n\nWomen were not formerly immured in houses and dependent on hus- \nbands and relatives. They used to go about freely, enjoying themselves \nas best they pleased. . . . They did not then adhere to their husbands \nfaithfully; and yet . . . they were not regarded as sinful, for that was the \nsanctioned usage of the times. . . . Indeed, that usage, so lenient to \nwomen, hath the sanction of antiquity. The present practice, however, \nof women being confined to one husband for life hath been established \nbut lately. 29 \n\nAfter Brahmanism established monogamy in some parts of \nIndia, the rules of marriage were greatly changed: "No act is to be done \naccording to her own will by a young girl, a young woman, though \nshe be in her own house. In her childhood a girl should be under the \nwill of her father; in her youth under that of her husband; her \nhusband being dead, under the will of her sons. A woman should never \nenjoy her own will. Though of bad conduct or debauched, a husband \nmust always be worshipped like a god by a good wife." ?0 \n\nRules similar to those of the Brahmans were established in \nwestern Europe by Christian authorities, insofar as possible. Some \nchurches even insisted that a bride at her wedding must kneel and \nplace her bridegroom\'s foot on her head in token of abject obedience. 51 \nChristianity accepted marriage only on condition that the partners \nform a slave-and-master relationship. This meant getting rid of the \nGoddess whose many forms and avatars protected the married \nwoman in all phases of matrimony and motherhood. \n\nJuno, the Roman Queen of Heaven, regulated every aspect of \nmarriage through her priestesses. Juno Pronuba arranged marriages. \nJuno Domiduca conducted the bride across the threshold of her new \nI home. Juno Nuxia perfumed the doorposts. Juno Cinxia untied the \nbride\'s virgin-girdle. Juno Lucina watched over the pregnant woman. \nJuno Ossipago strengthened her infant\'s bones. Juno Rumina provid- \ned mother\'s milk. Juno Sospita took care of women in childbed. 32 So it \nwent: in marriage and family matters, women ignored God and \nappealed to their own Goddess. The idea that a male priest should \npreside alone over a marriage ceremony was unthinkable which is \none reason why Christians didn\'t think of it. For many centuries, \nmarriage existed in a limbo without a deity to solemnize it, having no \nplace in canon law, which is why marriage remained so long under the \njurisdiction of common law. \n\nThe Council of Trent decreed that a person who even hinted that \nthe state of matrimony might be more blessed than celibacy would be \n\n\n\n589 \n\n\n\nMarriage declared anathema accursed and excommunicated. 33 The earliest \n\nform of Christian marriage was a simple blessing of the newly wedded \nj^ m ^ pair, in facie ecclesiae outside the church\'s closed doors to keep the \npollution of lust out of God\'s house. This blessing was a technical \nviolation of canon law, but it became popular and gradually won \nacceptance. In 1215 the fourth Lateran Council granted it legal \nstatus. 34 Still, the church maintained that there were no marriages in \nheaven, according to Christ\'s statement in the scriptures (Mark \n12:25; Luke 20:35). St. Thomas Aquinas assigned a "goodness value" \nof 30 to marriage, as compared with 60 for widowhood, and 100 for \nlifelong virginity. 35 \n\nMedieval folk tales convey a distinct impression that the Christian \nGod opposed marriage. One story said a pure youth and maiden \nagreed never to marry, "for love of God." But their heathen parents \nforced them into a wedding. By God\'s grace, the ground opened \nunder their feet and swallowed them before they could spoil their \nvirginity. A priest who dared officiate at the wedding was found dead \nnext day. Another young couple eloped, being forced to defy God, who \n"did not sanction earthly marriages." Gebhard, archbishop of Co- \nlogne, was said to have blessed married couples illegally, and even toi \nwife himself. He was excommunicated, besieged by Catholic forces \nin Godesberg Castle, caught, and killed. The ruins of his castle are sti! \nshown to travelers. 36 \n\nCommon-law marriages were often informal. Mere cohabitation \ncould constitute a valid marriage. 37 Temporary trial marriages were \nlegal up to the early 17th century. Peasant "betrothals" were often trial \nmarriages, incorporating such customs as "tarrying," night-visiting, \nand courting-on-the-bed. Pregnancy might make the union permanent, \nbut not necessarily. Bastardy was a commonplace in all social classes \nof medieval society. 38 \n\nThe church displayed remarkable reluctance to deal with the \nmatter of marriage at all. During the Middle Ages there was no \necclesiastical definition of a valid marriage nor of any contract to validate \none. Churchmen seemed to have no ideas at all on the subject. 39 \nThey ignored marriage, leaving it largely in the realm of the common \nlaw. \n\nUnder Roman and barbarian laws, marriages "could be freely \ninitiated and could be terminated without formality by either party \nand at any time." 40 This system persisted among common folk until \n1 563. Finally the church declared the priestly blessing indispensable \nto a legal marriage, refusing to recognize any more marriages made by \nthe common law. Still, the church\'s rule remained invalid in many \nareas for several centuries more. 41 \n\nIn 1753 Lord Harwicke\'s Act made clerical blessing a requirement \nfor legal marriage in England, but the Act didn\'t apply to Scotland. \nTherefore Scotland became a mecca for elopements, because legal \nmarriages could be made there by the old pagan custom of "handfast- \n\n\n\n590 \n\n\n\nling" simply joining the couple\'s hands in the presence of witnesses, \ni I without benefit of clergy. 42 All the way up to 1939, English lovers \nil could travel across the Scottish border to the "marriage town" of Gretna \nI Green for an instant wedding. \n\nWhen Christian authorities revised pagan marriage laws, they were \nI primarily concerned with placing a wife\'s property in her husband\'s \n| control and keeping it there. Women owned the land under the pagan \n{system, and their husbands could acquire an interest in it only \n\nthrough matrimony. This system was reversed in husbands\' favor. \nICommon-law and Morganatic marriages were provisionally accepted \nI by Christian churches only after many restrictions had been imposed on \nthe wife\'s rights of ownership and inheritance. Christian marital \nf morality amounted to taking the means of independence from women \nfland turning it over to men. \n\nCelibacy was strictly enforced among the clergy when new laws \nMpermitted men to bequeathe their property (and their wives\' proper- \nty) directly to their children. When priests were forbidden to make valid \nDmarriages, they couldn\'t have heirs. Thus all property they owned or \nI gained would revert to the church when they died. 43 Clerical marriages, \n\'on the other hand, meant a loss of ecclesiastical income. \n\nPriests abandoned the early church\'s rule of celibacy and began to \ni take wives during the 5th and 6th centuries. This continued to the \nf 1 lth century, when papal decretals commanded married clergymen to \n|tum their wives out of their homes and sell their children as slaves. 44 \nflThese new laws brought much more wealth to the church. Though \nIsome ex-wives stayed on as the concubines of their former husbands, \nI they were disinherited in the church\'s favor. (See Matrilineal \nInheritance.) \n\nChurchmen revered St. Hilary, who was married and the father of \na daughter. When his daughter wished to marry, however, Hilary \nforbade her. Fearing she might weaken and lose her virginity, he asked \n|God to kill her. God complied with a little help from Hilary \nihimself. After burying the daughter, "by his prayer" Hilary sent his wife \nIto heaven also. The legend claims the wife voluntarily begged Hilary \nIto "obtain for her the same grace which he had obtained for her \n(daughter." 45 \n\nBesides popularizing the peculiar morality of a saint who killed his \nfamily, the church fostered "chastisement" of wives by husbands, \nIciting St. Paul\'s teaching that "the head of every man is Christ; and the \nhead of the woman is the man" (1 Corinthians 1 1:3). In practice, \nunder the pretext of discipline a man could torture his wife with \nI impunity, and no legal or religious agency would defend her. A mild \nprotest in the 13th-century Laws and Customs of Beauvais noted that \nJan excessive number of women were dying of marital chastisement, \nso husbands were advised to beat their wives "only within reason." 46 \n\nThe theological view of the time was that "woman has sinned \nmore than man" and should therefore be unhappier; her suffering \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nMorganatic \nmarriage A form of \nlegalized \n\nconcubinage, first \ninstituted in \n\nGermany to allow high- \nranking noblemen \nand princes to "marry" \nwomen of low rank, \nor commoners, with the \nproviso that neither \nwife nor children of the \nmarriage would ever \nhave any legal claim on \nthe husband\'s \nproperty. \n\n\n\n591 \n\n\n\nMarriage must be doubled on earth, even in the womb, which is why female \n\nembryos did not receive their souls from God as early as male \n^^^^^ mma ^^^^ embryos. 47 Men were only doing God\'s will when they made women \nsuffer. \n\nThe Oriental heathen, whom Christians thought barbaric, were \nteaching different rules: "The householder should never punish his \nwife, but should cherish her like a mother. ... By riches, clothes, love, \nrespect, and pleasing words should one\'s wife be satisfied. The \nhusband should never do anything displeasing to her." 48 Westerners \nsimply condemned as obscene the passages in the Brhadaranyaka \nUpanishad describing as a sacrament a husband\'s sexual worship of his \nwife as "House-Goddess (Grhadevata)." 49 \n\nPhysical abuse and sexual coercion were so often the lot of a \nChristian wife that it came to be an accepted idea that no woman \ncould love a husband. A "lover" meant a man outside the marriage. \nThe Countess of Narbonne, ruler of France\'s celebrated Court of \nLove, said the relation between husband and wife and "the true love \nbetween lovers are two absolutely different things which have noth- \ning in common. . . . We say definitely and considerately that love \ncannot exist between married people." 50 One good reason was the \nmaster-slave relationship. "Men were exhorted from the pulpit to beat \ntheir wives and wives to kiss the rod that beat them." 51 \n\nMedieval society was so accustomed to the idea that all wives were \nbattered by their husbands, that churchmen used this as an argument \nfor women to renounce marriage in favor of the cloister. They told \nyoung girls that "the wife was subject to her husband, that often she \nwas exposed to blows and kicks, and often brought forth misshapen \noffspring. . . . While men are betrothed they seem filled with gentle- \nness, whereas after marriage they rule as cruel masters." 52 \n\nIt has been recently shown that, "Although omitted from most \nchurch historical accounts, the Christian church . . . has had a record \nof practicing and recommending physical abuse to women." The \nDecretum of 1 140 said: "It is right that he whom woman led into \nwrongdoing should have her under his direction so that he may not fail \na second time through female levity." Friar Cherubino\'s 1 5th- \ncentury Rules of Marriage made a husband his wife\'s sole judge: "Scold \nher sharply, bully and terrify her. And if this still doesn\'t work . . . take \nup a stick and beat her soundly, for it is better to punish the body and \ncorrect the soul than to damage the soul and spare the body. . . . \nThen readily beat her, not in rage but out of charity and concern for her \nsoul, so that the beating will redound to your merit." " \n\nA Russian pope recommended the use of a whip rather than a rod \nof wood or iron, which was more likely to cripple or kill. "Keep to a \nwhip," said the pontiff, "and choose carefully where to strike: a whip is \npainful and effective." 54 \n\nMartin Luther thought himself an unusually kind husband. He \n\n\n\n592 \n\n\n\nsaid when his wife "gets saucy, she gets nothing but a box on the \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nEnglish jurisprudence applied to marital "disagreement" the fam- \n\n| ous Rule of Thumb elucidated by Blackstone: a husband was free to \n| beat his wife with a whip or rod no thicker than his thumb, "in order to \nenforce the salutary restraints of domestic discipline." British law up \n\nt to the late 19th century decreed that acts which would amount to an \n(assault if committed against a stranger were legally innocent when \ncommitted by a husband against a wife. 56 Wives had little help from the \n\nIjlaw; they were legally classified with minors and idiots, and were \nconsigned to the custody of their husbands. 57 \n\nWhen John Adams was helping to draw up the Constitution of the \nUnited States in 1777, his wife Abigail wrote to him, "Do not put \n\nIsuch unlimited power in the hands of husbands. Remember, all men \n\ntwould be tyrants if they could." 58 Abigail\'s plea went unheard. The \nAmerican husband was no less tyrannical than his British forebear. It has \nbeen said that among the Puritans especially, the husband "exercised \nthe authority of God" over his wife. 59 \n\nIn 1848 feminist Emily Collins described a typical example of the \nabused American wife: a woman who mothered seven children, \ncooked, cleaned, washed, spun, wove, sewed and mended the family \n\nclothing, milked the cows, and took the multiple responsibilities for \nthe welfare of nine persons, including her husband, who beat her \nbecause she sometimes "scolded" that is, nagged, or complained. \nThis was accepted as sufficient reason for violent attacks on his hard- \n\nI working spouse. 60 \n\nUp to the middle of the 20th century, American law upheld the \nso-called doctrine of immunity, which meant the "sanctity of the \nhome" could not be invaded to stop husbandly violence. A man\'s home \nwas his castle, even if it was also his wife\'s prison. The law denied \nwomen the right to sue their husbands for assault because the suit \n"might destroy the peace of the home." Only in 1962 did a judge \nrule that the peace of the home was already destroyed by a wife-beating \nhusband, therefore the doctrine of immunity was legally unsound. 61 \n\nJ Even now, the law may refuse to recognize a woman\'s right to \nprotection within her home. \n\nWife-beating was a by-product of the Christian view of woman \n\nlas man\'s property. Napoleon remarked, "Woman is given us to bear \n\njchildren. She is our property. . . . She is our possession, as the fruit \ntree is that of the gardener." 62 St. Thomas Aquinas said a wife is lower \nthan a slave because a slave may be freed, but "Woman is in \nsubjection according to the law of nature, but a slave is not." 63 \n\nJosephine Henry reported that "The ownership of the wife estab- \nlished and perpetuated through Bible teaching is responsible for the \ndomestic pandemonium and the carnival of wife murder which reigns \nthroughout Christendom. In the United States alone, in the eighteen \n\n\n\nSir William \n\nBlackstone (1723-1780) \nFamous English \njurist, author of the \nCommentaries \nwhich became the \nstandard reference \nauthority of both British \nand American law \nthrough the 19th \ncentury. \n\n\n\nJosephine Henry \n\n19th-century Kentucky \nsuffragist and \npamphleteer, active in \nthe women\'s rights \nmovement. \n\n\n\n593 \n\n\n\nMarriage hundred and ninety-seventh year of the Christian era, 3,482 wives, \n\nmany with unborn children in their bodies, have been murdered in \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m co \'d blood by their husbands. . . . The by-paths of ecclesiastical history \nare fetid with the records of crimes against women; and \'the half has \nnever been told.\'" 64 \n\nFrom feudal times onward, Christian systems of slavery placed \nsimilar powers in the hands of slaveowners and husbands, often \ncombining the two functions. A sister of President Madison wrote: "We \nsouthern ladies are complimented with the name of wives: but we are \nonly the mistresses of seraglios." A southern planter\'s wife described \nherself as "the chief slave of the harem." The wife of a Confederate \ngeneral wrote: "God forgive us, but ours is a monstrous system. . . . \nLike the patriarchs of old, our men live all in one house with their \nwives and their concubines. . . . Any lady is ready to tell you who is the \nfather of all the mulatto children in everybody\'s household but her \nown. Those, she seems to think, drop from the clouds." 65 \n\nSouthern ladies\' doublethink about their roles was an expected, \neven mandatory, social response. The first edition of Emily Post\'s \nEtiquette described "The Instincts of a Lady: As an unhappy wife, her \ndignity demands that she never show her disapproval of her husband, \nno matter how publicly he slights or outrages her." 66 \n\nThough the rule obviously served the man\'s dignity, not the \nwoman\'s, unhappy wives tried to obey it. Patriarchal society managed \nto convince them that if they failed to make their marriages "happy," \nthey failed as women and as human beings. Hence, battered wives \noften accepted the guilt for their own victimization. Recent investigators \nreport that battered wives go to great lengths to conceal the crime \nbecause of their own embarrassment and shame. 67 \n\nChurches helped develop this secret embarrassment. One clergy- \nman\'s routine advice to brides was: "Your duty is submission. . . . \nYour husband is, by the laws of God and of man, your superior; do not \never give him cause to remind you of it." 68 Of all professional groups, \nclergymen have proved least able or willing to help battered wives. \n\nOne abused wife from a "nice suburban neighborhood" wrote of \nher appeal to her clergyman and the reprimand she received. The \nminister demanded to know what she was doing wrong to bring her \nhusband\'s violence down upon herself, and advised her only to search \nher own soul and discover how she might behave better to relieve the \ntension. She had a husband so violent that she feared for her life. Yet \nher spiritual leader and alleged comforter gave her less than no comfort. \nHe tried rather to increase her suffering with a specious burden of \nguilt. 69 \n\nIn 1977 Ellen Kirby of the Board of Global Ministries of the \nUnited Methodist Church wrote: "The institutional church either \nthrough its blatant sexist theology, which has blessed the subordination \nof women, or through its silence, blindness, or lack of courage, has \nallowed itself to be one of the leading actors in the continuing tragedy of \n\n\n\n594 \n\n\n\ni." 70 Under the circumstances it seems unrealistic for Pope Paul \nto have observed in 1966 that "a true contradiction cannot exist \n/een the divine laws pertaining to the transmission of life and \npertaining to the fostering of authentic conjugal love." 71 Translat- \nI from theologese, the "divine laws" meant simply the church\'s \nid on birth control and "authentic conjugal love" meant husbandly \nlinance over the wife. \n\nPatriarchal religions developed many rules for maintaining male \nlinance in marriage, but the structure was inherently unstable: \n\nThe patriarchal "family" of academic social science is but a euphemism \nfor the individualistic male with his subordinate dependents. As a social \nunit the family means the (male) individual activated by his most \naggressively individualistic instincts; it is not the foundation, but the \nnegation of society. . . . \n\nHuman society did not arise as an organization of adjusted interests. \nIt arose out of an extra-rational sentiment; it has never existed in any \nform except through the binding force of such sentiments. n \n\nThe patriarchal family was at bottom unnatural, a reversal of the \nogical authority of the female over her dependents. "Economic man \nicis in perfect self-interest; a woman cannot base her relationships \n[vithin the family on the principle of quid pro quo: she gives. It appears, \nrom a masculinist perspective, that woman might be a more primi- \ntive version of a man not because there is prima facie evidence of her \nower intelligence, but because of her loving and giving nature, which \nIs itself taken as evidence of lower intelligence. Rousseau\'s \'noble \njiavage\' like his ideal woman was compassionate and nurturing." 75 \n\nAs a rule, women were driven into marriage by social pressures \npat made spinsterhood even less attractive economically. When \npatriarchal laws took property out of women\'s hands and placed it in the \nlands of men, unmarried women became as helpless to support \npemselves as wives were. In the 1 7th century, a "spinster" was any \nwoman imprisoned in a "spin-house" without money or male protec- \ntors. John Evelyn described a spin-house as a place where "incorrigible \nbid lewd women are kept in discipline and labor." 74 It was seldom \nnoticed that spinsters had become "incorrigible and lewd" in an effort to \nparn a living, in a society that allowed them to learn no skills other \n(than trying to please men. \n\nThough patriarchal marriage typically existed for the service of \nman, there was usually a pretense of male autonomy and leadership; \nand the discovery of its mythical quality caused the wife\'s "basic \ntrauma," according to Jessie Bernard: \n\nThere are few traumas greater . . . than the wife\'s discovery of her \nhusband\'s dependencies; than the discovery of her own gut-superiority \nin a thousand hidden crannies of the relationship; than the realization that \nin many situations his judgment is no better than hers; that he does not \nreally know more than she; that he is not the calm, rational, nonemotional \ndealer in facts and relevant arguments; that he is, in brief, not at all the \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nJohn Evelyn (1620- \n\n1706) English \ngentleman of letters, \nauthor of about 30 \nbooks including a \nfamous diary. \n\n\n\nJessie Bernard \n\nModern American fem- \ninist author and \nsociological researcher. \n\n\n\n595 \n\n\n\nMarriage \n\n\n\nMarlene Dixon \n\nModern feminist, \nwriter, and teacher of \nsociology at a Canadian \nuniversity. \n\n\n\nkind of person the male stereotype pictures him to be. Equally, if not \nmore, serious is her recognition that she is not really the weaker vessel, \nthat she is often called upon to be the strong one in the relationship. 75 \n\nMarc Feigen Fastau also pointed out that false commitment to \nthe myth of masculine steadiness and objectivity brings on disillusion- \nment among wives: \n\nNothing contrasts more sharply with the masculine image of self-confi- \ndence, rationality, and control than men\'s sulky, obtuse, and, often \nvirtually total, dependence on their wives to articulate and deal with their \nown unhappy feelings and their own insensitivity, fear, and passivity in \nhelping their wives to deal with theirs. This, more than anything else, \ndisillusions women about their men. Bromides like \'Men are just \novergrown little boys\' are both a description of the phenomenon and an \nattempt, by labeling it innocuously, to ease the pain of disillusionment: \ndisillusionment at having subordinated yourself to a person who isn \'t, it \nturns out, special enough to justify the sacrifice, who is probably not \nmuch smarter than you are in most ways and in some very important ways \nis a lot less perceptive, more dependent and more childlike. 76 \n\nThough wives provide an essential support system, without \nwhich few men would be capable of carrying on productive careers, the \n"job" of a wife is the last relic of slavery in that it earns nothing. A \nwoman can\'t collect unemployment insurance for losing this non-paid \njob, even when it means financial hardship for herself and her \nchildren. As a widow she is taxed at the highest level because she is not \nconsidered a contributor to her husband\'s estate. Yet a conservative \nestimate of the market value of a wife\'s services amounts to over \n$1,000,000. Nor is the job an easy one. Data collected by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services show that housewives \nsuffer more from symptoms of stress than do working women. 77 \n\nMarlene Dixon said marriage is "the chief vehicle for the perpetu- \nation of the oppression of women; it is through the role of wife that \nthat subjugation of women is maintained." 78 To a large extent it was th< \nChristian concept of marriage in the western world that brought this \nabout, since the church declared women socially, politically, and intel- \nlectually inferior and made them their husband\'s chattels. 79 \nWife-beating was so routine in Christian Europe that the standard \nsymbol of "marriage" in Alsatian New Year decorations was a \nminiature man beating his miniature wife. 80 \n\nNineteenth-century clergymen in both Europe and America con- \nsistently upheld a husband\'s right to abuse his wife and to use \n"salutary restraints in every case of misbehavior," without the interfer- \nence of what some court records of 1824 referred to as "vexatious \nprosecutions." In other words, it was vexatious for a battered wife to \nseek redress, but not vexatious for her husband to beat her in the first \nplace. Many clergymen still have this attitude. A battered wife recently \nsaid: "My husband repeatedly spoke scripture at me about what a \nwife\'s responsibility was. . . . She was supposed to be submissive, and he \n\n\n\n596 \n\n\n\nm \n\n\n\nivould quote Paul, verse after verse after verse. I didn\'t feel like I had Mars \n\nlery much to fight with. ... I don\'t recall any clergy person I went to \n\nknd I went to more than one being supportive of my feelings about ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhot continuing the marriage, of not wanting the abuse to continue. I got \n\n|io support from any clergyman." 81 \n\nOnly recently, and grudgingly, did the clergy of some denomina- \ntions remove the word "obey" from the bride\'s responses in the \n[narriage service. Many clergymen still believe a wife should bow to her \nhusband\'s wishes more than he bows to hers not the best attitude in \nfnen who think themselves qualified to act as marriage counselors. \n\n1.

The inscription of \n\nDarius at Behistun says the god was incarnate in a sacred king slain by Sign of Mars \n\nlis people. 2 His spirit ruled what Sufis still call the "fulfilling" death- \n\nirjdriebirth process, known as mardiyya or martyrdom. 3 An early \n\nPhrygian version of the same sacrificial god appears in Greek myth as \n\nhe flayed satyr Marsyas, slain on a pine tree "between heaven and \n\njarth" by order of the heavenly father. \n\nMars was "red" because his basic Indo-European prototype was \nhe pre-Vedic flayed god Rudra, father of the Maruts or sacrificial \nvictims, red with their own blood. Rudra "the red one" was born of the \nhree-faced virgin-mother Marici, Goddess of birth, dawn, and the \n^ew Year, a manifestation of the ancient feminine Trinity. Thus, \nludra bore the title of Tryambaka, "He Who Belongs to Three \n\n\n\n\n597 \n\n\n\nMartin, Saint Mother Goddesses." In Japan this Goddess was known as Marici-deva \n\nor Marishi-ten, whom later patriarchal writers masculinized as a \n^^^^^^^^^^_ Buddhist monk. However, this alleged monk always wore the garments \nof a woman. 4 \n\nThe same Goddess was Marica to the Latins. She gave birth to the \ngod-king Latinus, ancestor of all Latin tribes. Her consort was the \nflayed goat god of the Lupercalia, Faunus, another incarnation of Mars, \nwho also appeared in bird-soul form as the sacred woodpecker Picus, \ngiving oracles from the top of a phallic pillar in his shrine. 5 \n\nThe Martian New Year sacrifices took place in the god\'s month of \nMarch, which once began the Roman year; this is why the "Ides of \nMarch" were considered dangerous to kings. In the Babylonian sacred \ncalendar, the same New Year month of atonement sacrifices was \nMarcheshvan. 6 The astrological sign of this month still begins the year, \naccording to astrologers\' tradition. \n\nIn northern Europe, Mars was identified with Tiw, Tyr, or Tig: \nnames derived from Indo-Germanic dieus, "God." 7 Just as Mars was \noften confused with the sky-father Jupiter, so Tiw was another name for \nthe sky-father Odin. Tiw\'s sign was a lingam-yoni arrangement of a \nphallic spear attached to a female disc. As wielder of the spear or \nlightning bolt of fertility, Mars-Tiw became a god of battle. He was \nthe patron of Roman warriors, who called him Marspiter (Father Mars) \nand honored him with "martial" exercises on the Campus Martius, \nsite of a temple of Maris in Etruscan times. His sacred day was Tuesday, \nnamed after Tiw in English, though it is still dies martis in Latin and \nsimilarly named in Latinate languages (French mardi). \n\nTo account for the inevitable story that the Queen of Heaven as \nCelestial Virgin gave birth to the sacrificial god, Romans claimed the \nBlessed Virgin Juno spurned the love of her spouse, Jupiter, and to spite \nhim conceived Mars by her own unaided feminine fertility magic, the \nlily blossom that represented her own yoni. 8 \n\n1.

It was claimed that the saint himself was cut up and eaten in \nthe form of an ox. Every household killed some domestic animal and \nsprinkled the threshold with the animal\'s blood. St. Martin as "martyr" \ncame to be regarded as "one of the very chief of the saints. . . . The \ntradition of slaughter is preserved in the British custom of killing cattle \non St. Martin\'s Day." 1 \n\nThe holy day was a continuation of the Roman festival of Martina- \n\n\n\n598 \n\n\n\n/hen the god Bacchus prefigured Jesus by turning water into \n! at his sacred marriage (the Christian adaptation appearing in the \nof John). By British folk custom down to the 19th century \n[d., schoolboys filled vessels of water on St. Martin\'s Night so the water \n\nId be turned into wine before morning. By a benevolent decep- \nlon like that of the Tooth Fairy, parents sometimes replaced the water \nkith wine during the night. 2 \n1. Miles, 204-6. 2. Hazlitt, 393. \n\n\n\nMartyrs \n\n\n\nMartyrs \n\nince the 9th century, when martyr-legends became wildly popular, \n[ne church listed countless bogus saints said to have died in "persecu- \nJons" of the 4th and 5th centuries. With more imagination than \nistoricity, martyrologists created a church history out of fictions. Rec- \nrds of the alleged martyrs slain in "persecutions" are virtually \nbnexistent. The gory fantasies reported by such sources as the Golden \nlegend were invented from six to nine centuries after the time of the \n! leged events. Even Catholic scholars say martyrologists\' tales are so \nnildishly naive that when reading them "it is often difficult to refrain \npm smiling." \' \n\nStill, one might wonder why a smile should be the response to \nhese grisly fantasies of torture and butchery, which hint at a sadistic \nlirn of mind in those who invented such tales for the edification of their \ni [How Christians. \n\nMost of the classic martyrs were assigned to the persecution of \nPiocletian, which Christian tradition greatly exaggerated. Diocletian \nLade no objection to Christians until 298 a.d., when his priests claimed \nthristian unbelievers, present at an official sacrifice, prevented the \nception of favorable omens. The emperor ordered Christians to honor \ne gods by burning a pinch of incense on the imperial altars. For \nlose in the army or civil service, refusal to comply with this rule could \n[lean discharge. Five years later, quarrels between Christian and \nligan priesthoods escalated to the point where official oracles began to \nllsist on the closing of Christian churches. Some Christian zealots \nItok it on themselves to strike back by attacking the emperor himself. \n\nTwo fires were set in Diocletian\'s palace at Nicomedia. Three \nlihristian eunuchs, residents in the palace, were accused of arson and \nIcecuted. Centuries later they were canonized as Saints Dorotheus, \njtorgonius, and Peter. 2 After the fires, Diocletian also ordered the \nItest of some Christian priests. Martin Jones says "Some months later, \nHie imprisoned clergy were all forced to sacrifice, and then, with the \nIcception of a few obstinate reclusants, released." Some of the obstinate \nHies were executed. But the "persecution" was never more than \nHilf-hearted. Though it continued intermittently for a while, it was \nIntirely abandoned by 3 1 3 a.d.* \n\n\n\nThe Golden \nLegend Collection of \nthe "lives" of various \nsaints, with emphasis on \nmartyrdoms and \nmiracle tales, written by \nJacobus de Voragine, \na 13th-century \nDominican bishop in \nLombardy, later \narchbishop of \nGenoa. \n\n\n\nDiocletian (Gaius \nAurelius Valerius \nDiocletianus) \nRoman emperor from \n284 to 305 a.d. Of \nmilitary background, \nDiocletian was noted \nfor his economic and \nadministrative \nreforms. \n\n\n\n599 \n\n\n\nMartyrs These ten years and comparatively few deaths were blown up into \n\na legendary reign of terror, after the teachings of the primitive church \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m were forgotten. One of these teachings was that martyrdom, called "the \nCrown," automatically brought Christlike apotheosis and made the \nsoul of the martyr one with Jesus, as the soul of an Egyptian could \nbecome one with Osiris. In pursuit of this "imitation of Christ," so \nmany Christians purposely broke laws and clamored for the death \npenalty that Antoninus of Antioch irritably inquired whether Chris- \ntians had no ropes or precipices to kill themselves, without constantly \nmaking trouble for the authorities. 4 \n\nSome of the early churches taught that martyrdom was required t( \nbe among the blessed in heaven. Apocryphal Gospels quoted Jesus: \n"Truly I say to you, none of those who fear death will be saved; for the \nkingdom of death belongs to those who put themselves to death." \nTertullian said he longed for martyrdom, "that he may obtain from Go \ncomplete forgiveness, by giving in exchange his blood." Gnostics \nhowever ridiculed martyrdom, saying it made God a cannibal who \ndesired human blood; and the advocates of martyrdom were said to \ninflict it on each other all too often. Some Gnostic writings denounced \nother Christians for "oppressing their brothers" and even making \nchildren suffer, to save their souls. 5 This was one of the sources of the \ncharge that Christians sacrificed children to their deity. 6 Centuries \nlater, Christians used the same charge of child sacrifice to justify \npersecution of the Jews. 7 \n\nIn reality, Rome embraced many diverse faiths, Christianity \namong them, with far more tolerance than Christians showed. Angus \nsays, "In the matter of intolerance Christianity differed from all pagan \nreligions, and surpassed Judaism; in that respect it stood in direct \nopposition to the spirit of the age." 8 Some of the so-called persecutors \nwere actually trying to stop the fighting between different factions of \nChristians, like the emperor Maxentius who arrested the rival popes \nMarcellus and Eusebius to prevent further street battles between their \nfollowers. Another pair of rival popes, Damasus and Ursinus, precipitat \ned such bloody fighting that 137 corpses were left in the basilica of \nSicininus in only one day. Ammianus reported that "It was only with \ndifficulty that the people, having been roused to such ferocity, could \nbe brought back to order." 9 \n\nA persecution, rich in martyrdoms, was expected from the "Apos- \ntate" emperor Julian, an urbane pagan who disliked fanatical \nChristians. But Julian disappointed them by leaving them alone. Greg- \nory of Nazianzus held even Julian\'s tolerance against him: "He \nbegrudged to our soldiers the honor of martyrdom. ... In order that wc \nmight suffer, and yet not win honor as we should, suffering for \nChrist\'s sake ... he attacked our religion in a very villainous and \nungenerous way, introducing into his persecution the traps and snares \nof argument." Julian was killed in a military camp, under odd circum- \nstances. According to Libanius, the emperor was assassinated by a \n\n\n\n600 \n\n\n\nchristian less inclined to argue, more inclined to destroy the Martyrs \n\n(pponent. 10 \n\nThere are no verifiable contemporary records of individual Chris- ^^^^^^^^^^^ \ntans "slain for their faith" under the Roman empire. Eusebius \nU. 371 a.d.) mentioned a letter, supposedly from the churches of Lyons \nnd Vienne to the churches of Asia and Phrygia, listing the names of \n[8 Christians executed in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, 177 a.d., nearly \nwo hundred years earlier. 11 Eusebius probably wrote the letter \n^imself. It was he who adopted the principle of "holy lying" on the \nhurch\'s behalf. Ever afterward, churchmen cited Eusebius to prove \nnat any lie is permissible if it glorifies the Christian faith. 12 \n\nAside from this father of "holy lying" and his dubious letter, no \nnartyrs\' names were heard of until the 7th to 9th centuries. A \npajority were only names or titles of old pagan deities whose shrines had \n|een pilgrimage centers since pre-Christian times. \n\nThe real martyrs of the early Christian era were not made by the \nlagans so much as by their fellow Christians. Diocletian\'s persecution \nlas negligible compared to the violent warfare of Christian against \nChristian in those centuries. Zealots in Asia Minor destroyed whole \npwns and villages and massacred thousands of "heretics." Women and \nhildren were tortured until they agreed to receive the Host of the \nrue faith. Ammianus said "no wild beasts are so hostile to man as \nChristian sects in general are to one another." 1? Toleration itself was \n[unishable. At Trier in the 4th century two bishops, Priscillian and \npstantius, with two other men and a woman, were illegally tortured \nnd executed by their fellow Christians for being too tolerant of their \nlagan neighbors. 14 \n\nIn the 5th century, Innocent I proclaimed that God gave the \nhurch the right to kill. Its military might "had been granted by God \nnd the sword had been permitted for the punishment of the guilty" \n(leaning anyone holding unorthodox opinions. 15 A letter attributed \np Clement, bishop of Rome, said whoever refuses to "bow the neck" to \nGod\'s bishops, priests, and deacons is guilty of insubordination \n{gainst God and must suffer the death penalty. 16 \n\nOnce in power, the church attacked both pagans and non-ortho- \npx Christians in a reign of terror. By a conservative estimate, pagan \nmperors spilled less than one ten-thousandth of the amount of Chris- \nan blood later shed by other Christians. 17 The persecutions in Asia \nMinor were thus described in 386 a.d.: \n\nThe monks say they are making war on the temples but their warfare is i \nway of pillaging what little poor unfortunates do have, the produce of \nthe fields and the cattle they feed. . . . They grab people\'s land, claiming \nthe place is sacred. Many have been robbed of their patrimony on such \na pretext. They who (as they say) give honor to their god by fasting are \ngetting fat on the wretchedness of others. \n\nAnd as for those others, the victims of such a sack, if they go to \ntown, to a "shepherd" he will be called that, though he may not be a \n\n\n\n601 \n\n\n\nMary good shepherd precisely and tell him, weeping, of their injustices suf- \n\nfered, the shepherd will approve of the pillagers, and chase their victims \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^ away, saying that they should count it a gain that they have not suffered \n\nworse. \n\nIf they hear of a place with something worth raping away, they \nimmediately claim that someone is making sacrifices and committing \nabominations, and pay the place a visit. \' 8 \n\nChristian zealots sometimes tortured pagan women to make \nthem renounce their Goddess. 19 This may have been the real origin of \nthe many fictitious "virgin martyrs" said to have renounced love and \nmarriage to embrace Christian celibacy, retaining their virginity despite \nthe most horrendous tortures. Catholic writers now call the church\'s \nvirgin-martyr horror tales only "edifying romance" though why these \nsadistic fantasies should seem edifying is not made clear. 20 Christian \ntales of the pagans\' execution of virgins made no sense in any case; for \nunder Roman law, no virgin could be executed. If sentenced to \ndeath, a virgin had to be legally deflowered before sentence could be \ncarried out. 21 No Roman law made virginity perse a crime. \n\nThe real reason why the church demanded martyr-myths was that \nit was the best traditional way to achieve union with a deity and \nconsequent immortality. From the earliest ideas of sacred kingship, he \nwho died in agony could become at once one with his God. The very \nword martyr was the name of the ancient sacred king in Persia, Martiya- \nImmanuel (see Mars). 22 The Fourth Book of Maccabees, written \nabout the 1st century B.C., provided a typical scriptural model for \nChristian martyrologists. It described the sufferings of the Jew Elea- \nzar and his companions, who endured the usual sequence of flayings, \nburnings, scourgings, disembowellings, etc., couched in loftily meta- \nphorical prose: "Eleazar, like a fine steersman steering the ship of \nsanctity on the sea of the passions, though buffeted by the threats of \nthe tyrant and swept by the swelling waves of the tortures, never shifted \nfor one moment the helm of sancity until he sailed into the haven of \nvictory over death." 2? \n\n1.

Churchmen knew the same titles were applied to Mary as to \nher pagan forerunners: "queen of heaven, empress of hell, lady of all \n[the world." 2 \n\nThe Speculum beatae Mariae said Mary was like the Juno- \nUrtemis-Hecate trinity: "queen of heaven where she is enthroned in \nIthe midst of the angels, queen of earth where she constantly manifests \njher power, and queen of hell where she has authority over the \njdemons." According to the Office of the Virgin, she was the primordial \nbeing, "created from the beginning and before the centuries." 3 \n\nChristian patriarchs therefore sought to humanize and belittle \n(Mary, to prove her unworthy of adoration. Epiphanius ordered: "Let \nithe Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit be worshipped, but let no one \nI [worship Mary." 4 Anastasius said, "Let no one call Mary the Mother \npf God, for Mary was but a woman, and it is impossible that God should \nbe born of a woman." 5 Ambrose called Mary the "temple" of God, \nend "only he is to be adored who worked within the temple." 6 Up to \n1 the 5th century the church persecuted as heretics a sect calling \n(themselves Marianites, who claimed that Mary possessed the true \nquality of divinity. 7 Mariolatry has plagued Christian patriarchy \nthroughout its history, as the popular need to worship the Mother-figure \nalways arose unbidden. \n\nSome early church fathers sought a way out of the dilemma by \n\\ attacking Mary\'s motherhood, to prove her neither divine nor really \nnaternal. Some claimed Jesus wasn\'t born in the ordinary way but \n! suddenly materialized before Mary. 8 Marcionites said Jesus could \n[never touch vulgar female flesh, therefore he was never born at all. He \ndescended from heaven as a fully formed adult. 9 Some church fathers \nrejected Mary\'s motherhood on the ground that she was not only a \n\\ mere mortal, but even a sinful woman. 10 \n\nThere was ecclesiastical opposition to Mary throughout the Chris- \ni lian era. Pope Nicholas III ordered Jean d\'Olive, a friar \n{\'distinguished for learning and piety," to burn with his own hands a \n| Tact he had written in praise of Mary because it expressed excessive \nHevotion to her. 11 When it was permitted, Marian devotion did appear \n|o take on an Oriental extravagance. \n\nGermanus, Patriarch of Constantinople in 717, called Mary "Lady \nIpll-holy" and "Lady most venerable," maintaining that no one could \ni be saved or receive the gift of grace except through her, since God \nIpbeys her "through and in all things, as his true mother." Henri \n| poudon, archdeacon of Evreux, said his people thought Mary "as much \nis, or more than, God himself." Isidore Glabas said Mary ruled in \nleaven before her earthly birth; like a creatress she brought all things \nI nto being, and all the angels obeyed her. Bernardine of Siena said \n( Mary\'s birth of the Savior through her own mystic powers was more \n\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\nSpeculum beatae \nMariae A book of \npraise attributed to \nSt. Bonaventura (13th \ncentury), but \nprobably written \nanonymously some \ncenturies later. \n\n\n\nIsidore Glabas \n\n14th-century Greek \nMarianist theologian. \n\n\n\nSt. Bernardine of \nSiena (1380-1444) \nFranciscan \n\ntheologian and reformer \nwho preached \nagainst the moral \nbreakdown \nconsequent upon the \npapacy\'s Great \nSchism. \n\n\n\n603 \n\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\nSt. Louis-Marie \nCrignion de Montfort \n\n(1673-1716) French \npriest who founded two \ncongregations and \nwrote True Devotion to \nthe Blessed Virgin. \nHe was canonized in \n1947. \n\n\n\nProtoevangelium, \n\nalso known as the \nRevelation of James: \na Gospel written in the \nsecond century a.d., \nvalued by early church \nfathers as authentic \nbut eventually \neliminated from the \n\n\n\nmiraculous than God\'s generation of him. "Even if she had not been \nthe Mother of God, she would nevertheless have been the mistress of \nthe world." Louis-Marie de Montfort declared that Mary had abso- \nlute power over God. 12 \n\nPeople of the Middle Ages often viewed God as their persecutor, \nMary as their defender. Early 16th-century woodcuts showed God \nshooting arrows of pestilence, war, and inflation at the world, while the \ninscription pleaded with Mary to restrain him. 13 It was said that \n"Mary stands for Mercy, and it is only because of her influence at cour \nnot because of love or goodwill on God\'s part, that heaven is within \nreach." M A 14th-century Franciscan wrote: \n\nWhen we have offended Christ, we should go Erst to the Queen of \nHeaven and offer her . . . prayers, fasting, vigils, and alms; then she, like \na mother, will come between thee and Christ, the father who wishes to \nbeat us, and she will throw the cloak of mercy between the rod of \npunishment and us, and soften the king\'s anger against us. 1S \n\nAshe says, "Christian scripture and doctrine totally preclude \nplacing Mary above Christ. Yet the vitality of Christ\'s own Church has \noften seemed to depend on her rather than him. . . . [Wjithout her he \nwould probably have lost his kingdom." 16 During its first five centuries, \nChrist\'s church discovered that no amount of force would make \npeople renounce their Mother Goddess. She had to be preserved in \nsome form: \n\nThe church seemed doomed to failure, destined to go down to bloody \ndeath amidst the bleeding corpses of its victims, when the people \ndiscovered Mary. And only when Mary, against the stern decrees of the \nchurch, was dug out of the oblivion to which Constantine had assigned \nher and became identified with the Great Goddess was Christianity finally \ntolerated by the people. . . . The only reality in Christianity is Mary, the \nFemale Principle, the ancient goddess reborn. l7 \n\nIn the eastern empire it was said the mark of true Christian faith \nwas to "confess the holy Ever-Virgin Mary, truly and properly the \nMother of God, to be higher than every creature whether visible or \ninvisible." Ephraem of Syria called Mary the bride or spouse of Jesus as \nwell as his mother, after the fashion of the pagan Goddess and her \nson-consort; she was also Gate of Heaven, Ark, and Garden of Paradise. \nMary personally sprinkled the face of Adam with life-giving rain, \nwhich placed her in the creation myth as "co-redemptress." Ephraem\'s \nopinions were called heretical by some, but after a lapse of 1 600 \nyears in the year 1920 he was declared a Doctor of the Universal \nChurch by papal decree. 18 \n\nThe Christian figure of Mary was gradually created during the first \nfour centuries of the Christian era, out of bits and pieces of the Great \nGoddess who conceived "sons of God" and Saviors in all the temples of \nthe ancient world. The Protoevangelium said Mary served as a \ntemple hierodule, and received God\'s seed as she was beginning to spin \n\n\n\n604 \n\n\n\na blood-red thread in the temple the work of the Fate-virgin, first of \nthe Moerae or "Marys," who spun the thread of destiny. 19 At this \nmystically crucial moment the angel Gabriel "came in unto her" \n(Luke 1:28), the biblical phrase for sexual intercourse. \n\nOther sources also identified Mary with the Fate-spinner, whom \nthe Greeks called Clotho, youngest of the trinity of Moerae. The \nCoptic Discourse on Mary, attributed to Cyril of Jerusalem, represented \nMary as the same triple Goddess of Fate, incarnate in the three \nMarys who stood at the foot of Jesus\'s cross. 20 In like manner, the three \nFates of Nordic myth stood at the foot of Odin\'s tree of sacrifice; their \nvirgin aspect was sometimes Freya, "the Lady." The Swedes called the \nconstellation of Orion the distaff of the virgin Mary, because it was \nformerly the distaff used by Freya to spin the destinies of men. 21 \n\nGreek myth presented an image of the Virgin Persephone almost \nidentical to that of fate-spinning Mary. Persephone sat in a sacred \ncave or temple, starting to spin a web with a great picture of the \nuniverse the magic picture which the Mother made into reality. At \nthat moment the Heavenly Father appeared in the form of a phallic \nserpent and begot the savior Dionysus on her. 22 \n\nIn an effort to make Mary\'s impregnation as sexless as possible, \nsome Christian ascetics invented very peculiar mechanisms for it. \nSacred art showed semen emanating from God\'s mouth and passing \nthrough a long tube that led under Mary\'s skirts. Some theologians \nclaimed God\'s seed was carried to Mary in the beak of the Holy Dove. \nOthers said it came from Gabriel\'s mouth, to be filtered through the \nsacred lily before entering Mary\'s body by way of her ear. 23 \n\nThough the Christian God took over the Triple Goddess\'s ancient \ntrinitarian character at the Council of Nicaea, there is some evidence \nthat early Christians perceived Mary as a trinity. Like the Buddhists\' \nMara, she was sometimes a spirit of death. 24 The Gospel of Mary \nidentified all three of the Marys at Jesus\'s crucifixion with one another, \nas if they were the same Triple Goddess who attended the death of \nthe pagan Savior. 25 \n\nFor some centuries, eastern churches worshipped a Father-Mother- \nSon trinity modeled on such pagan triads as Osiris-Isis-Horus, \nZeus-Rhea-Zagreus, Apollo-Artemis-Heracles, etc. This idea was so \ncommonplace that even writers of the Koran felt compelled to deny \nthe divine trinity of God, Mary, and Jesus. 26 Moslem sources also \npreserved another manifestation of the Virgin Goddess as Mar \nMariam or Sancta Maria, mother of the Persian savior Mani. 27 As "the \nSea" (Maria), the Triple Goddess swallowed up the god she gave \nbirth to. In solemn imitation, the women of Alexandria threw images of \nOsiris into the sea after his Passion Play. 28 Hebraic copies of this rite \nprobably account for Plutarch\'s report that the chief city of Palestine \nJerusalem was built in honor of a child whom Isis killed and threw \ninto the sea. 29 \n\nMary was also closely associated with the Great Goddess of \n\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\nGospel of Mary One \n\nof the early Gnostic \nGospels, once \nincluded with the books \nof the New \nTestament but later \neliminated from the \ncanon. A copy was \nrediscovered in the \n1940s at Nag Hammadi. \n\n\n\n605 \n\n\n\nMary \n\n\n\nMariale Common \nname of two Marianist \nhandbooks, the first \nwritten by an \nanonymous author \nand falsely ascribed to \nAlbertus Magnus; \nthe second written in \n1478 by the \nFranciscan friar \nBernardine of Busti. \n\n\n\nEphesus, whose temples she took over. In the 5th century an \nEphesian priest named Proclus delivered a sermon on the multiform \nnature of Mary, calling her "the living bush, which was not burnt by \nthe fire of the divine birth . . . virgin and heaven, the only bridge \nbetween God and men, the awesome loom ... on which the gar- \nment of union was woven." 30 \n\nMuch was made of the reversal of Mary\'s Latin Ave and the name \nof Eve (Eva). Mystics said Mary was Eve\'s purified reincarnation, as \nJesus was the similar reincarnation of Adam. 31 Somehow, theologians \nfailed to recognize that the new incarnations apparently reversed the \nparent-child relationship. Then again, as Adam and Eve were spouses, \nso the relationship of Mary and Jesus sometimes verged on the sexual \nor conjugal. In a legend ascribed to St. John, Jesus welcomed Mary into \nheaven with the words, "Come, my chosen, and I shall set thee in my \nseat, for I have coveted the beauty of thee." 32 \n\nThe church\'s doctrine of the assumption of Mary was explained in \na number of ways. Early churchmen declared that Jesus visited \nMary\'s tomb variously located in Ephesus, Bethlehem, Gethsemane, \nor Josaphat and raised up her corpse, which he made to live again; \nthen he personally escorted her into heaven as a live woman. 33 She was \nnot a soul or a spirit but an immortal person in her own original body. \nThis became the official modern view when the doctrine of the \nassumption was declared an article of faith in 1950, when Pope Pius \nXII pronounced that "the immaculate mother of God, the ever Virgin \nMary, when the course of her earthly life was run, was assumed in \nbody and in soul to heavenly glory." 34 But the point had already been \nargued for more than a thousand years. \n\nThe church\'s problem was to take advantage of popular reverence \nfor Mary but at the same time prevent her literal deification. Some \ntheologians of the 13 th century claimed Mary\'s mortality should bring \nmore women to obey the church, because the king of heaven "is no \nmere man but a mere woman is its queen. It is not a mere man who is \nset above the angels and all the rest of the heavenly court, but a mere \nwoman is; nor is anyone who is merely man as powerful there as a mere \nwoman." 35 \n\nAlways the theologians feared to impute too much power and \nglory to Mary. Pope John XXIII, presuming to know Mary\'s inner \nthoughts, announced: "The Madonna is not pleased when she is put \nabove her Son," though in fact it was the church who was not \npleased. Catholic doctrines themselves attributed to her two of the three \nbasic characteristics of divinity: she was immortal by reason of the \nassumption, and sinless by reason of the Immaculate Conception. \nThe third requirement of divinity, omniscience, was conceded to her \nby popular belief. A 1 3th-century Mariale said she had perfect knowl- \nedge of divine mysteries, understood all scriptures, foresaw the future, \nand knew everything about mathematics, geography, astronomy, alche- \n\n\n\n606 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmy, and canon law even in her earthly life, when there was no Mary \n\ncanon and therefore no canon law. 36 A French manuscript illustration \n\nshowed Mary enthroned beside God on Judgment Day, weighing ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsouls in her balances like her prototype the Goddess Maat 3000 years \n\nearlier. 37 (See Alchemy.) \n\nThe Welsh confused Mary with the triadic White Goddess, and \nseldom asked the blessing of God without also imploring the favor of \n"the white Mary." 38 Saints\' tales implied that Mary\'s was the true touch \nof canonization. St. Bernard was ennobled by three drops of milk that \nthe Virgin pressed from her own breast for him. 39 St. Catherine of \nSiena also claimed to have been nourished by Mary\'s milk. 40 \n\nMany legends depicted Mary as the only true source of the milk of \nhuman kindness. At Mainz Cathedral she gave away one of her \nimage\'s gold shoes to a starving beggar, who had pleased her by playing \nhis fiddle for her. He was caught with the shoe, arrested, and \nsentenced to death. On the way to the scaffold he paused to pray to the \nVirgin, and she exonerated him by publicly giving him her other \nshoe. The beggar was released, but the priests took away the gold shoes \nand locked them in the treasury, "lest the Virgin should again be \ntempted to bestow them upon some penniless beggar who prayed for \nher aid." 41 \n\nMary\'s mercy often proved superior to that of God or Jesus. She \nwas occasionally represented leaning on the balance that weighed a \nsinner\'s few good deeds, to make them heavier than his evil deeds \nand save him from damnation. Her mercy extended even to the Jews, \ndespite her priests\' detestation of them. On Easter Day in Bourges, a \nJewish child took Holy Communion along with his Christian friends. \nFor this offense, the boy\'s father threw him into a furnace; but he lay \nunharmed by the fire, saying the Lady who stood on the Christians\' \naltar was protecting him. "Then the Christians, understanding that \nhe meant the statue of the Blessed Mary, took the aged Jew and threw \nhim into the furnace, and he was burnt and consumed." 42 \n\nEthiopian Christians\' Lefafa Sedek, "Bandlet of Righteousness," \nsaid God gave the secrets of salvation to humanity only because Mary \nrequested it, when she began to grieve for her relatives writhing in hell\'s \nRiver of Fire. Egyptian paganism was the real source of this "Chris- \ntian" scripture, copied from the Book of the Dead with the name of \nGod substituted for Ra, of Christ for that of Thoth, and of Mary for \nthat of All-Merciful Isis. 43 \n\nSome theologians said even the worst of sinners could win a sure \nsalvation by doing some special service for Mary. Two scribes pleased \nher by making copies of the Book of the Miracles of the Virgin Mary. \nAfterward they committed many sins, and when they died, devils \ncame for their souls. But the Virgin pulled them away from the devils, \nsaving them on account of their devotion to her. 44 \n\nAt times it seemed that Mary, not God, was the real opponent of \n\n\n\n607 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMary evil forces. Spengler said this was "one of the maxima of the Gothic, \n\none of its unfathomable creations one that the present day forgets and \n\n^^^^^^^^-^ m deliberately forgets It is not possible to exaggerate either the \n\ngrandeur of this forceful, insistent picture or the depth of sincerity with \nwhich it was believed in. The Mary-myths and the Devil-myths \nformed themselves side by side, neither possible without the other. \nDisbelief in either of them was deadly sin. There was a Mary-cult of \nprayer, and a Devil-cult of spells and exorcisms." 45 Historian Henry \nAdams noted: "Without Mary, man had no hope except in atheism, \n\nand for atheism the world was not ready The thirteenth century \n\ncould not afford to admit a doubt. Society had staked its existence, in \nthis world and the next, on the reality and power of the Virgin.""* 6 \n\nCaesarius of Heisterbach told a story showing that Mary was more \nrevered than God. A knight of Liege needed money and so made a \npact with Satan. When asked to curse and renounce God, he did so \nwillingly. However, when the demon required him to renounce the \nVirgin, he refused, horrified. Therefore the Virgin later intervened to \nsave him from damnation. 47 \n\nMary dispensed compassion (Hindu karuna) more effectively than \nChrist, for this very quality had been associated with the feminine \nimage from the beginning. Compassion was the chads of sacred harlots, \nwhich contributed much to Mary\'s consistent patronage of prosti- \ntutes. The "whore" Mary Magdalene was one of the original Marian \ntrinity. 48 Augstein says Mariolatry evolved because "the people need- \ned a queen of heaven, as the Israelites needed one in Jeremiah\'s time, \none for whom they could bake cakes, a great mother, a fertility- \nprostitute; but she was half shown to them, half withheld, and Freud \nonly gives us half the truth when he says that the Christian religion \nrecreated the mother-god." 49 Actually, the people recreated the \nmother-god out of their own pagan heritage. \n\nChurchmen claimed that all women lay under a threefold curse. j \nThey were accursed if they were barren. They were accursed also if \nthey conceived, since conception was of the nature of original sin. They \nwere accursed by the pains of childbirth, in fulfillment of God\'s curse \non Eve. But Mary escaped all three curses. "Mary alone of all women is \nblessed, because she is virgin and fruitful, she conceives in holiness, \nand gives birth without pain." 50 Of course this view of Mary did little to \nimprove the lot of ordinary women, presenting them with a wholly \nimpossible ideal, yet implying that they fell short of the ideal only \nbecause of their sinfulness. 51 The ancients saw no incongruity in a \nGoddess who was both virgin and mother (as well as lover and crone), \nbecause she represented all women in all phases of life. Christians \nhowever insisted on taking the "miracle" literally, having lost sight of its \nsubtle allegory. \n\nA hidden reason for the church\'s adoption of Mary was the \n\n\n\n608 \n\n\n\nuccessful amputation of her pre-Christian sexuality. Of all the Mary \n\nAttributes she inherited from the ancient Goddess, Mary\'s virginity was \n\nTiost emphasized. She was called "the Virgin," not "the Mother." m^mmmhmmmm \n\nChurch fathers insisted that she never engaged in sexual intercourse in \n\nher life, even though the Bible plainly spoke of Jesus\'s brothers and \n\nisters. 52 St. Ambrose demanded, "Would the Lord Jesus have chosen \n\ntor his mother a woman who would defile the heavenly chamber with \n\nhe seed of a man, that is to say one incapable of preserving her virginal \n\nthastity intact?" 53 Marian legends insisted that, although Mary was \n\n[mazingly beautiful, no man could ever look on her with desire. 54 \n\nYet some monasteries institutionalized desire for Mary, who "mar- \nked" the monks as Christ "married" nuns. If a knight placed his ring \nj>n the finger of Mary\'s image, she would grip it firmly so it couldn\'t be \ntemoved. At this, the knight considered himself a Bridegroom of the \nnrgin and entered a monastery. The same tales were told of pagan \nftatues of Venus, who "married" any man who placed a ring on her \nnarble finger. 55 In 1470 a Breton Black Friar, Alain de la Roche, \nlaimed the Virgin married him in the presence of many saints and \nngels, placing on his finger a ring woven of her hair. 56 \n\nCistercians styled themselves "Knights of Our Lady," associating \nheir Lady with the pagan May Queen. Aegidus\'s 1 3th-century \nistory of the order said it was the custom in the time of Bishop Albero \npr the clergy of Liege to choose "from among their concubines" a \nfaschal and Pentecostal Queen, who was robed in purple, crowned, \nnroned, and worshipped with drums and music, "revered almost \nnth idolatry as if she were an idol." 57 She also manifested herself as the \n[airy Queen who watched over a monastery near Laach as the \nnonks\' divine Bride. She announced each man\'s death three days in \npvance by placing a lily in his stall at midnight. 58 \n\nGothic cathedrals were dedicated not to God or Jesus but to Notre \nUame; they were collectively called "Our Ladies" or "Palaces of the \nQueen of Heaven." 59 Many of them were built over pagan shrines of \npe Great Goddess. Rome\'s cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore was \n\'kiilt over the sacred cave of the Magna Mater. Santa Maria in Aracoeli \np the Capitoline Hill was formerly a temple of Tanit. Mary\'s \nhurches throughout Italy were founded on shrines of Juno, Isis, \nMinerva, Diana, Hecate. One church was even naively named Santa \n_Haria sopra Minerva: Holy Mary over (the shrine of) Minerva. 60 \n\nkin the 6th century, the great temple of Isis at Philae was re- \nicated to Mary. 61 Aphrodite\'s sanctuaries on Cyprus became \niurches of Mary, whom the Cypriots continued to address by Aphro- \nite\'s name. 62 At Chartres, the heathen idol of the virgo paritura (Virgin \nliving Birth) was preserved in the so-called Druid Grotto under- \nth the cathedral. It was said to be a black statue of Mary. 63 \nEcclesia, "the Church," was one of Mary\'s titles. She was identi- \n\n\n\n609 \n\n\n\nMary fied with both the buildings and the organization of Holy Mother \n\nChurch as bride and mother of God. Yet this pseudo-female church \n^^^^^^^^^^^ remained the exclusive property of men. As late as February 1977 \nPope Paul VI again forbade ordination of women, saying the church \n"does not consider herself [sic] authorized to admit women to priestly \nordination." The pope maintained that priests must have a "natural \nresemblance" to Christ, and if they were women "it would be \ndifficult to see in the minister the image of Christ." 64 There was no \nmention that a priestess might present a resemblance to Mary, who \nsymbolized the church itself. The modern church prefers to forget that \nearly churches of Mary were staffed by priestesses, not priests. 65 \n\nAbove all, Christian authorities feared Mary might be the channel \nthrough which Goddess-worship could reestablish itself, for she \ninspired utterances similar to those the ancient Mother inspired, like \nGoethe\'s: "Supreme and sovereign Mistress of the World! ... Oh \nVirgin, in the highest sense most pure, oh Mother, worthy of all our \nworship, our chosen Queen, equal with the gods." 66 The secret, \nineradicable heresies of Marian worship received graphic form in the \nfamous Vierge Ouvrante Mary as a statue that opened up to show \nGod, Jesus, angels, and saints contained inside her. \n\nIn the generating and nourishing, protective and transformative, feminine \npower of the unconscious, a wisdom is at work that is infinitely superior \nto the wisdom of man \'s waking consciousness, and that, as source of vision \nand symbol, of ritual and law, poetry and vision, intervenes, summoned \nor unsummoned, to save man and give direction to his life. \n\nThis feminine-maternal wisdom is no abstract, disinterested knowl- \nedge, but a wisdom of loving participation. . . . In the patriarchal \ndevelopment of the Judeo-Christian West, with its masculine, monotheis- \ntic trend toward abstraction, the goddess, as a feminine figure of \nwisdom, was disenthroned and repressed. She survived only secretly, for \nthe most part in heretical and revolutionary bypaths. . . . \n\nSeen from the outside, the "Vierge Ouvrante" is the familiar and \nunassuming mother with child. But when opened she reveals the \nheretical secret within her. God the Father and God the Son, usually \nrepresented as heavenly lords who in an act of pure grace raise up the \nhumble, earth-bound mother to abide with them, prove to be contained in \nher; prove to be the "contents" of her all-sheltering body. 67 \nMary represented the second of the two expedients men used to \novercome their fear of women, according to Homey: disparagement \nand idealization. 68 But she was so ideal that she had to be apotheo- \nsized just as unmistakably as Jesus himself. So she rose bodily from the \nearth and ascended to glory. Unfortunately, those who formulated \nthis idea were quite ignorant of the vastness of the universe, and their \nsimplistic "rising to the sky" no longer serves an age in which such \ninformation is readily available. Even assuming that Mary\'s body could \ntravel at the speed of light an impossible idea to begin with it \nwould be only two thousand light-years away at the present time, about \n\n\n\n610 \n\n\n\nftM i \n\n\n\none-fiftieth of the distance across our own galaxy, let alone plunged Mary \n\ninto the unthinkable immensity of intergalactic space. And yet in an era \n\nwhen the absurdity of the idea is perfectly plain to the educated, to be ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nexact on June 30, 1968, the Credo of Pope Paul VI reconfirmed the \n\ndogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary though God \n\napparently didn\'t take the trouble to inform him about the method of its \n\naccompl ish ment. 69 \n\nBut not all minds in the modern age are modern minds. Many \nremain ignorant of what has been discovered about the physical \nuniverse. Many are ignorant of the theories and doctrines professed by \ntheir own religion. They worship Mary only because their inner \nbeing demands a mother-archetype, and she is the only one presented \nto them. They don\'t know how many "Marys" there were before \nChristianity. But educated churchmen know. Canon John de Satge \nwrote: "The evangelical has a strong suspicion that the deepest roots \nof the Marian cultus are not to be found in the Christian tradition at all. \nThe religious history of mankind shows a recurring tendency to \nworship a mother-goddess. . . . May it not be the case, the evangelical \nwonders, that what we have here is in reality an older religion, a \npaganism which has been too lightly baptized into Christ and whose \nancient features persist under a thin Christian veil?" 70 \n\nHowever, Mary wasn\'t "lightly" adopted by Christianity. She was \nopposed, attacked, and finally accepted only with many theological \nmisgivings and restrictions. Early Gospels that dwelt on the divinity of \nMary were labeled "poisonous" by the orthodox church. 71 Christian \nmystics who coveted the female role and spoke of "becoming Mary and \nbearing God from within," did so in defiance of the church\'s earlier \nedict that Mary couldn\'t claim the title of Theotokos (God-bearer), \nbecause God couldn\'t be born of a mortal woman. 72 The edict was \nabandoned after several centuries only because Christians wished to \nemulate the pagan Mystery-cults whose Savior-gods were invariably \nborn of mortal virgins. (See Virgin Birth.) \n\nChristian art of the first five centuries showed Mary in a position \nlower than Jesus, even lower than the Magi, who wore haloes while \nshe wore none. In the 6th century she acquired a halo and rose to the \ncentral position in a group of non-haloed apostles. By the 9th century \nshe reigned as Queen of Heaven in the middle of the apse in two \ncathedrals. 73 \n\nBy the 14th century, Wyclif was writing: "It seems to me \nimpossible that we should obtain the reward without the help of Mary. \nThere is no sex or age, no rank or position, of anyone in the whole \nhuman race, which has no need to call for the help of the Holy Virgin." \nThe Te Deum Laudamus declared, "All the earth doth worship \nthee, Spouse of the Eternal Father." 74 \n\nWhen Mary appeared in a subordinate position, it was in the role \nf Daughter like the Virgin Kore on the lap of the Elder Goddess \n\n\n\no \n\n\n\n611 \n\n\n\nMary represented by "God\'s grandmother," the ancient Anna (St. Anne, \n\ncalled Mary\'s mother). In some painted or sculpted groupings, the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ two Goddesses and the male infant seem to form a trinity quite \n\nexclusive of God. 75 An observer might be reminded of the Egyptian \ngod-king on the laps of his Two Mothers, they who would nurse him \nforever and thus give him eternal life. The mythical history of St. \nAnne reveals that she, even more directly than Mary, descended from \nthe image of that fertile Creatress, Mother Earth. 76 \n\nLegends and images of Mary exerted an uncanny appeal even in \nthe "scientific" modern age with its professed skepticism about the \nsupernatural. In 1945, a young boy named Joseph Vitolo was greatly \nimpressed by the film Song of Bernadette, and subsequently conjured \nup a vision of the Virgin for himself. He conversed with her for sixteen \nconsecutive nights at a certain rock in the Bronx. She told him to \nhave a chapel built on the spot, and promised the appearance of a \nhealing spring within a short time. \n\nThough the site received the popular name of the Bronx Lourdes, \nand credulous folk hurried there in astonishing numbers to pray for \nmiraculous cures, the spring never appeared. Eventually, young Joseph \nbecame embarrassed by the fuss he had caused. He then said the \nVirgin told him she wouldn\'t come any more to that place. Despite this \ndisappointment, for many years the faithful continued to gather and \ndig in the mud, seeking the holy spring. 77 \n\nBut it was not only the simple-minded who sought help from \nMary. Historian Henry Adams thought Christianity\'s divine mother, \nhowever attenuated, offered the only hope of spiritual comfort in an \nalienated technological society. He saw that "the males of his society, \nwho had transferred so many of their once autonomous activities to \nmachines and automatons, did not have sufficient life-sense to save \nthe race. In their blind pride over their scientific facilities, they would \ncling to the insensate mechanisms they had created, making them go \nfaster and faster, though incapable of applying the brakes. . . . Henry \nAdams, at the end of his own career, turned to another countervailing \nform of energy, the energy of life, the energy of erotic love, reproduc- \ntion, and creation; he sought a counterpoise to chaos by invoking \nwoman\'s faith in her own creativity, in all the ramifying, formative \nprocesses of life, above all those of sex, love, and motherhood." In a \npoetic address to the Virgin he said: "I feel the energy of faith, not in \nthe future science but in you." 78 \n\nOnce more it seemed that God (or man) depended on his Mother \n(or woman) to straighten up the mess he had made, even if it meant \nceding supreme power to her. An 1 8th-century theologian wrote, "At \nthe command of Mary all obey, even God." Today it is widely \nrecognized even by laymen that "two rivers of common source, Mary \nand Maya, the Virgin and Shakti, once again run into one: and the \n\n\n\n612 \n\n\n\nidess is once more, as she ever was, the creatrix of the universe, the Mary Magdalene \n\nself-revealing energy of the unknowable God." 79 \n\n\n\n1.

Therefore medieval traditions concern- \ning Mary Magdalene hark back to her early mystical supremacy. She \nwas called Mary Lucifer, "Mary the Light-giver." It was said Jesus \nraised Lazarus from the dead solely for love of her. "There was no \ngrace that He refused her, nor any mark of affection that He withheld \nfrom her." 5 \n\nThe Pistis Sophia made Mary Magdalene the questioner of Jesus, Pistis Sophia (Faith- \n\nin the Oriental manner of the catechism applied to the god by his Wisdom) A Gnostic \n\nShakti or Devi (Goddess). The female questioner then was addressed as scr \'P^e of the 3rd \n\nccnturv a O trcinsritccl \n"Dearly Beloved." 4 Jesus used the same form of address, though later from q^i^ \n\neditors eliminated all traces of the identity of his questioner; but it was Coptic, setting forth the \n\napparent that his "dearly beloved" was Mary Magdalene. 5 teachings of Jesus \n\nOrigen showed a mystic devotion to Mary Magdalene, confusing u P on his return to earth, \n\nher with the Goddess by calling her "the mother of all of us," and ] 2 y ears after his \n\n1 <* resurrection. \n\n\n\n613 \n\n\n\nMary Magdalene \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, \nexerting a powerful \ninfluence on the \nearly Greek church. At \nfirst he was \naccounted a saint, but \nthree centuries after \nhis death he was \ndeclared a heretic \nbecause of Gnostic \nelements found in \nhis writings. \n\nGospel of Mary \n\nOne of the early \nGnostic Gospels, \nonce included with the \nbooks of the New \nTestament but later \neliminated from the \ncanon. A copy was \nrediscovered in the \n1940s at Nag Hammadi. \n\n\n\nsometimes Jerusalem, and sometimes The Church (Ecclesia, another \ntitle of the Virgin). Origen claimed Mary Magdalene was immortal, \nhaving lived from the beginning of time. 6 \n\nThus it seems Mary the Whore was only another form of Mary \nthe Virgin, otherwise the Triple Goddess Mari-Anna-Ishtar, the \nGreat Whore of Babylon who was worshipped along with her savior-son \nin the Jerusalem temple. 7 The Gospel of Mary said all three Marys of \nthe canonical books were one and the same. 8 \n\nIndeed, the Virgin and Whore were still confused with one \nanother in the 7th century a.d. when, on the day of the Nativity of \nthe Blessed Virgin, Pope Sergius instituted an annual procession to the \nold temple of the prostitute-goddess Libera, changing the temple\'s \nname to Santa Maria Maggiore: Most-Great Holy Mary. 9 It was not \nmade clear which Holy Mary was meant. A Gnostic poem merged \nthe two of them as a primal feminine power: "I am the first and the last. \nI am the honored one and the scorned one. I am the whore, and the \nholy one." 10 \n\nMagdalene means "she of the temple-tower." The Jerusalem \ntemple had a triple tower representing the triple deity, one tower \nbearing the name of the queen, Mariamne, an earthly incarnation of the \nGoddess Mari. 11 This was the same Mariamne, Miriam, or Mary \nwho took Joseph for her lover. 12 Priestesses of this temple apparently \nsubsidized Jesus and his companions, according to Luke 8:1-3, \nwhich says Jesus and "the twelve" were financially supported by Mary \nMagdalene and a group of women. Latin texts say the women \nprovided for "him" (Jesus), but Greek texts make it "them." n \n\nThe seven "devils" exorcised from Mary Magdalene seem to have \nbeen the seven Maskim, or Anunnaki, Sumero-Akkadian spirits of \nthe seven nether spheres, born of the Goddess Mari. Their multiple \nbirth was represented in her sacred dramas, which may account for \ntheir alleged emergence from Mary Magdalene. An Akkadian tablet \nsaid of them: "They are seven! In the depths of the ocean, they are \nseven! In the brilliancy of the heavens, they are seven! They proceed \nfrom the ocean depths [Maria], from the hidden retreat." H \n\nThe Gospels say no men attended Jesus\'s tomb, but only Mary j \nMagdalene and her women. Only women announced Jesus\'s resur- \nrection. This was because men were barred from the central mysteries \nof the Goddess. Priestesses announced the successful conclusion of \nthe rites, and the Savior\'s resurrection. The Bible says the male apostles \nknew nothing of Jesus\'s resurrection, and had to take the women\'s \nword for it (Luke 24:10-1 1). The apostles were ignorant of the sacred \ntradition and didn\'t even realize a resurrection was expected: "They \nknew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead" \n(John 20:9). \n\nMari-Ishtar the Great Whore anointed or christ-ened her \ndoomed god when he went into the underworld, whence he would \n\n\n\n614 \n\n\n\nrise again at her bidding. That is, she made him a Christ. Her priestess Mary Magdalene \n\nraised the lament for him when he died in the flesh, as a sacrificial \n\nvictim. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, victims were told: "The harlot who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nanointed you with fragrant oil laments for you now." 15 Temple- \nwomen of Jerusalem raised the same lament for Tammuz (Ezekiel \n8:14), with whom Jesus was identified. Jesus himself said Mary \nMagdalene anointed him for his burial, pouring a precious unguent on \nhis head in the time-honored manner of the sacred king\'s crowning \n(Matthew 26:7-12). The christening-vase of holy oil was the ubiquitous \nsymbol of Mary Magdalene in Christian art though the virgin Mary \nalso bore the harlot\'s title of Holy Vase. 16 See Jesus Ben Pandera. \n\nVirgin and Whore constantly exchanged attributes through the \nMiddle Ages; the virgin Mary was consistently a special patron of \nprostitutes. 17 A Christian magic ring, now in the London museum, \nbears the legend, "Holy Mary Magdalene pray for me." 18 \n\nPope Julius II by a papal bull established a "sacred" brothel in \nRome, which flourished under his successors Leo X and Clement \nVII. The earnings of this brothel supported the Holy Sisters of the \nOrder of St. Mary Magdalene, indicating that the Holy Sisters and \nthe magdalenes (whores) were one and the same. Pope Innocent III \nalso favored Rome\'s collegia of prostitutes, called virgines, "unmar- \nried women." He publicly announced that any man who married one of \nthem would be specially praised in heaven. 19 \n\nMuch Christian myth-making went into the later history of Mary \nMagdalene. She was said to have lived for a while with the virgin \nMary at Ephesus. This story probably was invented to account for the \nname Maria associated with the Ephesian Goddess. Afterward, Mary \nMagdalene went to Marseilles, another town named after the ancient \nsea-mother Mari. Her cult centered there. Bones were found at \nVezelay and declared to be hers. Her dwelling was a cave formerly \nsacred to the pagans, at St. Baume (Holy Tree). 20 For thirty years she \nlived there without eating or drinking, her only nourishment the sweet \nsongs of the angels, a "delightful repast" she daily took in through her \nears. 21 A church was built over her grotto. Local winegrowers still offer \nvotive candles to her for a good vintage, as if the ancient fertility- \nmother still occupied the site. 22 \n\nSt. Martha accompanied Mary to Provence and worked a number \nof miracles there. Meeting a dragon named Tarasque (i.e., the Celtic \ndeity Taranis), Martha destroyed him by tying him up with her girdle \nand pouring holy water on his head. 23 Old images of the Twofold \nGoddess with her Great Serpent seem to have been renamed Mary and \nMartha. More often, Mary appeared as the typical feminine trinity \nruling birth, love, and death. As Holy Mary at the Cradle, she was the \nmidwife (or birth-goddess) who delivered Jesus. 24 As harlot and \nfunerary priestess she was linked with sex and death. Finally there was \nthe Gnostic suggestion that she was the original "pope," foundress of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n615 \n\n\n\nMascot Christ\'s church, according to the Oriental idea that spiritual authority \n\nMashya and Mashyoi must pass from male to female and vice versa (see Peter, Saint). \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ Some said she married St. John the Evangelist. 25 In 1 2th-century Milan \nthey were worshipped together in a dual cathedral built and adminis- \ntered by the monks of St. John jointly with the virgines of St. Maria \nMaggiore, also entitled Sancta Dei Genetrix (Holy Mother of God). \nThe androgynous cathedral was excavated in 1943-44, but its discovery \nwas kept secret. 26 \n\nDuring the 1 3th century a Dianic temple was rededicated to Mary \nMagdalene. At Easter, the story of her conversion of the rulers of \nMarseilles was chanted at the altar. Later the sacred song was sup- \npressed. Later still, Mary\'s devotees were forbidden to hold mass. In \n1781, the Magdalene temple was demolished. 27 \n\nl.Pagels,22,64. 2. Malvern, 47-49. 3. de Voragine, 355. \n\n4. Mahanirvanatantra, 173. 5. Malvern, 12. 6. Malvern, 60. 7.

Mascoto meant "witchcraft," from Provencal \nFrench masco, a sorceress (i.e., "masked one"). 1 The mascot of a \npagan totemic clan was its animal mask, worn on ceremonial occasions. \nBy Christian definition this became an animal-headed demon. \n\nl.deLys,94. \n\n\n\nMashu \n\n"Twin Peaks," the holy mountain of Akkadian myth into which the \nsun god daily sank; corresponding to the Bosom of Hathor, Ma-Nu, into \nwhich the Egyptian sun sank prior to his rebirth each dawn. 1 This \ntwin-peaked mountain-mother may be related to the Celtic death \ngoddess Macha, slayer of heroes; or even to the twin-peaked moun- \ntain Macchu Picchu, "Hitching Post of the Sun," in distant Peru. 2 \n\n1 .

God \n\n\n\n616 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Ahura Mazda) told them not to listen to the lies of the devil Mask \n\n(Ahriman).

Lamusse, 319. 2. Legge 1, 183. \n\n\n\nMask \n\nIt is a commonplace of primitive religion that deity resides in a sacred \nmask. A wearer of the mask is possessed by the spirit. He or she is the \nGod or Goddess, at least for participation in the sacred drama or \nprocession. Paleolithic rock drawings show divine creatures as human \nbeings wearing the masks of animals. Egyptian animal-headed deities \nwere obviously human beings wearing elaborate animal heads. 1 Modern \nAfricans, Melanesians, Australians, and many others maintain the \nsame belief. A witch doctor in a lion mask "isn\'t pretending to be a lion; \nhe is convinced that he is a lion. . . . [H]e shares a \'psychic identity\' \nwith the animal." 2 Similarly in pre-Christian Europe, anyone wearing \nthe mask or headdress of a god would become the god or, as \nChristians put it, would be possessed by the devil. \n\nThe word mask occurs in many Indo-European languages and \nmight be traced to the maskim of Sumer and Akkad: spirits of the \nnether spheres, or ancestral ghosts. Initiated Sufi magicians of the \nMiddle Ages wore spirit masks and became maskhara, "revelers," at \ntheir sabbats; this probably gave rise to the French designation of a \nmystery play as a masque} \n\nThe Scandinavian word for a mask was grim} This word was often \na component of gods\' names, like Grimnir (Masked One, a title of \nOdin). 5 In some legends the mask became a magic helmet that gave \nadmission to the spirit world. The most famous magic helmet was \ncalled Hildegrim, or Helkappe, or Tarnkappe, or Cap of Darkness. It \nwas given by Mother Hel (Hilde) to her favored heroes. It made \nthem invisible so they could enter the rose gardens of paradise as if they \nwere dead, yet return alive to the earth. The wearer of the mask \nbecame like the Lord of Death, able to reincarnate himself. \n\nThe Book of Heroes and the Wilkina saga named Hel\'s perennial \nconsort Grim. He lived with the Goddess in her secret cave until \nanother hero came to challenge and kill him and inherit the mask. 6 \nSome said this magic Helkappe was made of dog skin, since dogs \nwere sacred to the death-goddess, and it was the same mask worn by \nHades, the Lord of Death. 7 \n\nIn medieval France the same Lord of Death was Macabre, the \n\n\n\n617 \n\n\n\nMass \nMater \n\n\n\nGrim Reaper that is, the masked reaper, wielding his scythe as a \nreaper of souls. He performed the danse macabre, Dance of Death, in \nthe mystery plays and folk festivals so frequently featured in medieval \nart. Like Dancing Shiva in Kali\'s cosmic yoni, Macabre reminded his \naudience that the dance of life is also a dance of death; that the two \nare mutually dependent, neither possible without the other. 8 Tibetan \nmystery plays still present the death-masquerader in his skull mask \nand skeleton costume. 9 Evans-Wentz said medieval mystery plays \ncontained "symbolism so much akin to that found in mystery plays \nstill flourishing under ecclesiastical patronage throughout Tibet and the \nneighboring territories of Northern Buddhism as to point to another \nstream of Orientalism having come into Europe." 10 \n\nAnimal-headed deities of Egypt and the Middle East also found \nnew incarnations in medieval mystery plays, some of which may have \nbeen rooted in Neolithic rites when sacred dancers wore the heads of \nsacrificed beasts. At the ineradicably popular Carnival, "Mummers \nwent about dressed as various kinds of beasts, probably a remnant of \nsome seasonal festival of native gods, Gaulish or other, for in Gaul at \nall events gods often were represented under forms other than \nhuman." 11 \n\nPagan mask-wearing at religious festivals continued in the secular \nCarnival. After having denounced it as unlawful for many centuries, \nthe church finally capitulated and declared it "lawful" to wear masks in \nCarnival season. 12 However, the word masca remained one of the \nchurch\'s official words for a witch. 15 \n\n1.

Wilkins, 20 1 . 2. Upanishads, 53. \n\n\n\nMatrilineal Inheritance \n\nDuring the Neolithic age, the matrilineal clan system and the rule of \nmother-right were followed almost everywhere. Early writings from \nEgypt depict the woman in complete control of herself and her \nhome, with property descending from mother to daughter. The most \nsignificant revolution in Greece was the transition from matrilineal to \npatrilineal succession and the resulting destruction of clan loyalties. In \nmany other areas, the matrilineal system survived to a late date. The \nVenerable Bede mentioned rules of matrilineal succession still existing \nin parts of the British Isles up to the 9th century. 1 \n\nMatrilineal inheritance was the rule among British tribes until the \ncoming of Christianity. The Picts inherited all property, even "king- \ndoms," through the female line. 2 With the coming of Christianity, the \nold laws of mother-right began to decline. Sixth-century England still \nhad laws of equal inheritance, but a wife who decided to leave her \nhusband could carry off half the property and all the children. Later \nin the Christian era, the wife was deprived of everything. The English \n"heir" came from heres, cognate with the Greek word for a female \nlandowner, here or "Hera." The Magna Carta referred to a here as a \nperson of either sex. Later church laws listed heres as exclusively \nmale. 3 \n\nAmong pagan Celts, men bequeathed nothing to their children; \ntheir possessions were inherited by their sisters or their sisters\' \nchildren. According to old laws of Burgundy and Thuringia, property \npassed only in the female line. 4 Charlemagne opposed marriage for \nhis daughters, because under old Frankish laws of matrilineal inheri- \ntance this would have meant division of his kingdom. 5 \n\nIn pre-Roman Latium a landholding was called latifundia, founded \nby the Goddess Lat, after whom the country was named; thus each \nparcel of land belonged originally to a matriarch. 6 Even in the later \nRoman empire, husbands had no legal claim on their wives\' land or \npossessions as long as the wife was careful to spend three consecutive \nnights each year away from home. 7 This was a remnant of an earlier \ncustom like that of pre-Islamic Arabs, whereby a wife divorced her \nhusband by shutting him out of the home for three consecutive \nnights. 8 \n\nIn Greece, a parcel of property was temenos, "land belonging to \n\n\n\n620 \n\n\n\nt : moon," i.e., to woman. 9 This came to mean specifically the land \nrounding a temple of the Goddess. 10 In primitive times however, \nfcry matriarch\'s hearth was a temple of the Goddess. The popula- \nin and land unit in Attica was a demos, derived from De that is, the \nxldess De-Mother, or Demeter. 11 Chieftains ruled only through \nrriage with the resident matriarch. Harking back to this same system \nIndia, the Mahabharata says the leading attributes of a queen were \nh intelligence, sacred knowledge, and property. 12 \n\nIn most ancient societies, young men went forth from their \nMternal homes to seek their fortune elsewhere, because their sisters \nmerited the family home. It was a fixed habit of Greek men, and also \nthe pagan heroes depicted in fairy tales, to leave home and seek a \ntrilocal marriage with an heiress in a distant land. 13 \n\n"Matrimony" used to mean the feminine equivalent of "patrimo- \n| : inheritance of property, in the maternal line. Matrimony came \nbe synonymous with marriage only because marriage was a way for \nIn to gain control of property. \n\nIn Lydia, women owned the land, governed the communities, and \n|>k the initiative in love affairs. 14 The same was true in Egypt. \nInheritance passed through the mother rather than through the fa- \nftr," says Professor Gordon. "This system may well hark back to \nehistoric times when only the obvious relationship between mother \nad child was recognized, but not the less apparent relationship \nween father and child." For many centuries, patriarchal marriages in \nlypt existed side by side with old-style matriarchal unions, initiated \nthe wife and terminated by her will alone. 15 Since daughters, not \nIns, inherited property, it was the duty of an Egyptian daughter (not \n1) to care for aged parents. 16 \n\nMale scholars have been reluctant to describe ancient systems of \ntrilineal inheritance. After translation of early Babylonian texts, \n\nI Boscawen wrote, "The freedom granted [my italics] to women in \nibylonia allowed them to hold and manage their own estates. . . . \nfjhe mother here is always represented by a sign which means \nfcddess of the house.\'" 17 The implication was that women held \nA-ir property only through men\'s lenience, which was not the case, \nlbmen held property by the ironclad law of mother-right, and a \nIbylonian wife had the same title as a matriarch in India, grhadevata, \nflouse-Goddess." \n\nEven Mohammed, a leading opponent of matriarchal principles, \nftas enabled to carry out his mission thanks only to the wealth which \nacquired from his first wife Khadija, who was engaged in lucrative \nBBc and owned landed estates." 18 \n\nLanded property developed in the hands of women because \nmen were the first to farm the land, thereby establishing ownership \nlit. Some primitives still believe only the life-magic inherent in women \n\nII make plants grow: "Women know how to bring forth, and how \nInake the seed bring forth; men don\'t understand these things." 19 \n\n\n\nMatrilineal Inheritance \n\n\n\nMahabharata \n\nIndian epic poem, \nconsisting of historical \nand legendary \nmaterial gathered \nbetween the 4th and \n10th centuries a.d., \nincluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n621 \n\n\n\nMatrilineal Inheritance Amerindians universally attributed the invention of agriculture to \n\nwomen, sole owners of the cultivated fields. Matrilocal marriage and \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ matrilineal ownership of the home place were customary among the \n\nAlgonquin, Sioux, Seneca, Pawnee, Seminole, Kiowa, and Cree tribes. \nAs in ancient Greece, fathers were "strangers" in the clan. Women \nwere "mistresses of the soil." 20 "The women were the great power \n\namong the clans as everywhere else [T]he original nomination of \n\nthe chiefs always rested with them/\' 21 When the Iroquois conveyed \nlands to the U.S. government, documents had to be marked by their \nwomen, because the marks of men had no validity among the tribes. 22 \nPayuga women owned everything, as one missionary found to his \nastonishment: "If the husband gives his wife any cause, real or \nfancied, of offense, she packs up the tent and its furniture, appropriates \neven the canoe, and takes everything away; the children follow her, \nand the husband and father is left with the clothes he stands in and his \nweapons as his only possession." 23 The laws of this missionary\'s \nhomeland insisted on the contrary: a divorced husband retained every- \nthing including the children, the wife having no legal right even to \nher clothes. Hence, the missionaries\' surprise at Indian customs and \ntheir expectation of men\'s resentment. Yet Indian men didn\'t resent \nthe prerogatives of mother-right. They considered the mother\'s author- \nity natural, as Christians considered the father\'s authority natural. \nIndian husbands were known to take forty- or fifty-mile hikes only to \nprocure some special food craved by a pregnant wife. 24 \n\nIn Africa, women owned the land and other property connected \nwith the home place, and transmitted ownership to their daughters or i \ntheir brothers\' daughters. European governments and missions in Africa \nloosed a torrent of propaganda against matrilineal customs among the \nnatives. In most African nations, European land reforms consisted of \ntaking land away from the women and allocating it to their hus- \nbands. 25 This tended to make the women paupers and destroy their \nself-respect, as the tribes looked down on a woman who couldn\'t \nsupport her children. \n\nPatriarchal religious authorities everywhere changed ancient sys- I \nterns of matrilineal inheritance to put property in the hands of men. \nMedieval Christian kings commonly endowed their barons with the \nphrase, "Take that woman and her fief." 26 The early centuries of the \nChristian conquest of Europe were largely occupied with acquisition of \' \nlands from the pagan women. The monastic Order of Teutonic \nKnights got the island of Mainau from its owner, the Fair Maid of \nMainau, on condition that her lover be made head of the order. 27 \n\nThe Bible contains traces of former matrilineal inheritance and \nmatrilocal marriage, e.g., a man shall "leave his father and his \nmother, and cleave unto his wife" (Genesis 2:24). Naomi told her \ndaughters-in-law to "return each to her mother\'s house" (Ruth 1:8) \nbecause houses were owned by mothers, not fathers. A marriage \nagreement permitting removal of a woman from her maternal home \n\n\n\n622 \n\n\n\nwas a violation of ancient laws. Therefore Abraham, seeking a bride for Matrilineal Inheritance \nhis son, had to give many gifts to the bride, to her mother, and to her \n\nbrother (not to her father) as compensation for taking her away from her ^^^^^^^^^^^ \niiome (Genesis 24:53). \n\nRetention of property in the hands of a patrilineal clan was the \npurpose of the so-called Levirate marriage commanded by God \n(Deuteronomy 25:5). If a man died, his brother must marry the widow \nrather than allow her to take her property and depart from the family. \n[This rule dated from an early era when nomadic Israelites began to \nacquire lands and possessions by intermarrying with pagan women of \nCanaan, Moab, Phoenicia, etc. Modern laws play the same trick on \n|women. If a husband and wife die together in an accident, it is \n(assumed that the wife dies first, so the man\'s family will inherit. 28 \n\nPeople who maintained the matrilocal marriage tradition, like the \nAmerican Indians, developed no wedding laments, mock battles, \npseudo-kidnappings, or displays of coyness. 29 But in patrilocal marriages, \njthe bride\'s relatives usually put on a show of resistance. Matrilocal \nmarriage appeared in the Norse myth of Ragnar Lodbrok (Leather- \nbreeches), who married a foreign warrior-princess, but could not \ninduce her to leave her own country. When he wished to return to his \nhomeland, he was forced to leave her behind. 30 \n\nEven the peripatetic gypsies had matrilocal marriage traditions. In \ngypsy folklore, heroines never left their maternal homes. After death \npey were buried under the family threshold a custom of the early \nHindus, the gypsies\' forebears. 31 \n\nThe aim of European Christianity was acquisition of property, \nWhich meant overturning pagan systems of matrilineal inheritance. \nBy forcible seizure and warfare, the church managed to acquire fully a \nfthird of all the landed property on the continent by the early Middle \nAges. 32 The rest was more difficult. In some parts of Europe up to 1200 \nU.D., women were still listed as the landowners, and men identified \nthemselves by their mothers\' clan names. Until the 10th century, priests \nmarried to gain property, claiming that without their wives they \nwould succumb to "hunger and nakedness." Church laws revised the \nJjystem; then a series of papal decretals between 103 1 and 105 1 \nprdered priests to abandon their wives and sell their children into \nklavery. 33 Naturally, the property and monies thus acquired by a priest \nwould revert to the church upon his death, since he no longer had legal \nheirs. \n\nThe legal/ecclesiastical war on female property ownership went on \nIcentury after century, until women were so hamstrung by the laws of \nCod and man that they had almost nothing left that they could call their \nown. By the end of the 19th century, English wives could not \nadminister their own property even if they had any, nor make a will \ndisposing of it, without their husbands\' consent. 34 As late as 1930 in \nFrance, a woman was forbidden to do any business with a bank, not \neven to make small deposits, without her husband\'s permission. 35 Up \n\n\n\n623 \n\n\n\nMatronalia \nMay \n\n\n\nto the present time, lack of control over money and property is still the \ngreatest obstacle for women who wish to take their children and leave \nabusive or violent husbands. In this respect the centuries of patriarchal \neffort achieved their goal. \n\nI. Stone, 15, 37, 52; Boulding, 318. 2. Johnson, 157. 3. Beard, 194, 199-200. \n4.

The women\'s subsequent period of asceticism \nand fasting up to the festival of Ceres in April was the forerunner of the \nChristian fast of Lent. 1 Rites of the Matronalia were kept secret from \nmen and remain obscure to this day, though their purpose undoubtedly \nwas to make the Earth Mother ready for springtime regeneration. \n\nl.Gaster,645. \n\n\n\nIn Scandinavia, May \nwas dedicated to Maj, \nthe Virgin, either Mary \nor the pagans\' Virgin \nMother, interchange- \nably. In Saxon England \nthe month was called \nSproutkale: the sprout- \ning time of virgin- \nmother Earth with her \narchaic Aryan name of \nKale, Kelle, or Kali. \nAnother name for the \nmonth was Tri-Milchi, \nimprobably derived by \nthe Venerable Bede \nfrom a theory that the \nSaxon cows gave milk \nthree times a day in \nMay. 8 Alternatively, \nit meant the Triple \nGoddess\'s appearance \nin the form of three \n\n\n\nMay \n\nThe month of Maya or Maia, the Virgin Goddess of Spring; in \nnorthern Europe, Maj or Mai, the Maiden. 1 This was the traditional \nmonth of "wearing of the green" in honor of the Earth Mother\'s new \ngarment, and of fornicating in plowed fields to encourage the crops. \nMay was a "honey-moon" of sexual freedom throughout rural \nEurope up to the 16th century. 2 Marriage bonds were temporarily in \nabeyance. The maxim that "only bad women" marry in the month of \nMay probably was a relic of earlier taboos on all marriages during the \nmonth of license. 3 \n\nYet there were traces of a divine marriage ritual in the "May \nriding," when knights and ladies rode in pairs into the wood, led by \nthe Queen of the May on a white horse and her male companion on a \ndark one. They impersonated Frey and Freya, "the Lord" and "the \nLady" whose union made fertility magic each spring. 4 \n\nMay Eve was the great springtime festival of "witches," corre- \nsponding to Halloween at the opposite pole of the year. May Eve was \nknown in Germany as Walpurgisnacht, in Ireland and Scotland as \nBeltaine or Baltein, when the god Baal, Bel, or Balder was burned in \neffigy. Sometimes a man chosen by lot represented him, and leaped \nthrough the May fires still called "Balder\'s balefires" in rural Scandi- \n\n\n\n624 \n\n\n\nBavia. 5 Clearly, these were customs dating back to real burning of the May \n\npan who represented the god in his love-death (Liebestod). \n\nThe May King of medieval romance inherited the customs of ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nDiana\'s sacred kings. He won the "queen of a magic wood" (the \nIpoddess) by combat with her previous king on the festival of Ascension \nDay in May. Le Chevalier de la Charrette named him Meleagant, \njlrince of the land of no return (he was a Lord of Death). Le Morte \nWArthur corrupted his name to "Mellyagaunce," a lascivious May \npng who became the ritual lover of Queen Guinevere and led the \nlexual games of May Day. 6 A 1 5th-century poet identified the same \nMay King with Christ, who was like the Holy Rose of May: "the red \nlower that Mary bore." 7 \n\nThe god\'s phallus was planted in the earth\'s womb in the guise of \nhe Maypole, which was not originally European but a direct borrow- \nng from India where the Maypole is still "the great lingam." 9 In \n6th-century England its phallic symbolism was understood perfectly \nveil, as shown by the diatribe of the Puritan writer Philip Stubbes: \n\nYoung men and maids, old men and wives, run gadding overnight to the \nwoods, groves, hills, and mountains, where they spend all night in \npleasant pastimes; and in the morning they return, bringing with them \nbirch and branches of trees, to deck their assemblies withal. And no \nmarvel, for there is a great Lord present amongst them, as superintendent \nand Lord over their pastimes and sports; namely, Satan, prince of hell. \nBut the chiefest jewel they bring from thence is their May-pole, which \nthey bring home with great veneration, as thus. They have twenty or \nforty yoke of oxen, every ox having a sweet nose-gay of flowers placed on \nthe tip of his horns, and these oxen draw home this May-pole (this \nstinking idol, rather) which is covered all over with flowers and herbs, \nbound round about with strings, from the top to the bottom, and \nsometimes painted with variable colors, with two or three hundred men, \nwomen and children following it with great devotion. And this being \nreared up, with handkerchiefs and flags hovering on the top, they strew \nthe ground round about, bind green boughs about it, set up summer \nhalls, bowers, and arbors hard by it. And then fall they to dance about it, \nlike as the heathen people did at the dedication of Idols, whereof this is \na perfect pattern, or rather the thing itself. w \n\nYoung men and maids went into the woods, and few returned \nme "undefiled," as the observer said. According to Spelman, the \nic fellows and their girl friends fell "into ditches upon one \nnother," for the odd reason that they were "enveloped with a mist of \nwandering out of their ways." Douce had no doubt of the festival\'s \n>agan origin: "The Queen of the May is the legitimate representative of \nhe Goddess Flora in the Roman Festival." n Stuckeley described \nday celebrations in 1 724: \n\nThere is a May Pole near Horn Castle, Lincolnshire, where probably \nstood an Hermes (herm, phallic pillar) in Roman times. The boys \nannually keep up the festival of the Floralia on May Day, making a \nprocession to this hill with May gads (as they call them) in their hands. \n\n\n\n625 \n\n\n\nMaya This is a white willow wand, the bark peeled off, tied round with cowslips, \n\na thyrsus of the Bacchanals. At night they have a bonehre, and other \nmerriment, which is really a sacrifice, a religious festival. \' 2 \n\nNaturally the church was opposed to this religious festival. \nBishop Eligius of Noyons begged his converts in the 7th century to stop \nobserving the sexual rites of May without success. 15 A thousand \nyears later the month was still given over to "witches." Church bells in \n1 7-century Treves were rung all night throughout the month of \nMay, to "protect the city from flying witches." H \n\nThere were a few voices raised against ecclesiastical restrictions on \nthe activities of the Merry Month. William Fennor\'s Pasquil\'s Palino- \ndia (\\6\\9) lamented the new puritanical laws against the rites of May: \n\nWhen no capricious constables disturb them, \n\nNor justice of the peace did seek to curb them, \n\nNor peevish puritan, in railing sort, \n\nNor over-wise church-warden, spoiled the sport, \n\nHappy the age, and harmless were the days \n\n(For then true love and amity were found), \n\nWhen every village did a Maypole raise, \n\nAnd Witson-ales and May-games did abound . . . \n\nBut since the Summer poles were over-thrown, \n\nAnd all good sports and merriments decay\'d, \n\nHow times and men are chang\'d, so well is known, \n\nIt were but labor lost if more were said. \n\nAlas, poor May Poles; what should be the cause \n\nThat you were almost banish \'d from the earth ? \n\nWho never were rebellious to the laws; \n\nYour greatest crime was harmless, honest mirth . . . \n\nSome fiery, zealous brother, full of spleen, \n\nThat all the world in his deep wisdom scorns, \n\nCould not endure the May-pole should be seen \n\nTo wear a cox-comb higher than his horns: \n\nHe took it for an idol, and the feast \n\nFor sacrifice unto that painted beast.\' 5 \n\n1.

She \nalso gave birth to the Enlightened One, Buddha. 1 \n\nThe same Goddess, called Maia by the Greeks, was the virgin \nmother of Hermes the Enlightened One, who had as many reincar- \nnations as the Buddha. Sometimes Maia\'s partner was Volcanus (Greek \nHephaestus, the divine smith and fire-god). This was another mythic \n\n\n\n626 \n\n\n\nnating of male fire and female water. 2 Hindus said Agni the fire-god Maya \n\nvas the consort of Kali-Maya, though he was periodically swallowed \n\nlp and "quenched" by her. According to the Tantric phrase, the ^^^^^^ \n\nGoddess quenched a blazing lingam in her yoni. 3 \n\nAs the virgin mother of Buddha, Maya embarrassed ascetic Bud- \nIhists and was soon written out of the script. Like ascetic Christians \npeaking of Christ\'s birth, some Buddhists claimed the Enlightened One \nuld not touch his mother\'s "parts of shame" and so was born \nhrough an opening in her side. This mythic Caesarian section seems to \nlave been bungled, for a few days later Maya died "of joy," as \nJuddhist scriptures rather fatuously put it. 4 \n\nNevertheless, Maya remained very much alive as one of Kali\'s \nnost revered manifestations, because the very fact of "Existence" \nle material cosmos demanded her presence. As Zimmer analyzed \nler: \n\nMaya-Shakti is personified as the world-protecting, feminine, maternal \nside of the Ultimate Being, and as such, stands for the spontaneous, \nloving acceptance of life\'s tangible reality. . . . [S]he affirms, she is, she \nrepresents and enjoys, the delirium of the manifested forms. . . . Maya- \nShakti is Eve, "the Eternal Feminine, " das Ewig- Weibliche: she who ate, \nand tempted her consort to eat, and was herself the apple. From the \npoint of view of the masculine principle of the Spirit (which is in quest of \nthe enduring, eternally valid, and absolutely divine) she is the pre- \neminent enigma. s \n\nIn herself Maya embodied all three aspects of the maternal \nTrinity. Her colors were white, red, and black, the colors of the Gunas, \n>r the Virgin-Mother-Crone. 6 Like every other form of Kali, she was \nCreator, Preserver, Destroyer. She was also a spirit dwelling perpetually \nn women. A Mahayana text says, "Of all the forms of Maya, woman \ns the most important." 7 \n\nMaya\'s son Buddha was surrounded by her symbols. He entered \nlis trance of meditation under her sacred fig tree, which protected \nlim from the weather. On his return from the soul-journey, his first \nymbolic act was to accept a dish of curds from a maiden on Full \nvloon Day in the month of May, the greatest of Buddhist festivals. 8 \n\nNot only the month but many other traditions, names, and \nncepts attest to the great age and wide distribution of the Goddess \nifaya. She was more than the Maia who mothered Hermes; she was \nilso Maga the Grandmother-goddess who bore Cu Chulainn\'s \nnother; and the Mandaean Christians\' Almaya, called "Eternity," or \n\'the World," or "Beings"; and Maga or Maj the May-maiden in \nScandinavia. 9 Like the Hindu Maya who brought forth earthly appear- \ninces at creation, the Scandinavian one personified the pregnant \nvomb of chaos before the beginning: Ginnungagap. In this the World- \nnrgin was associated with the idea of magical illusion, creating \n\'appearances" like her Hindu counterpart. 10 \n\nThis universal Creatress-name may have reached the western \n\n\n\n627 \n\n\n\nMe hemisphere also. The Maya people of Yucatan offered sacrifices in \n\nMedea the same way as in northern India, at the same seasons, determined by \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ the same stars. 1 \' Mayan "scorpion stars" were the same as the \n\nconstellation Scorpio on Hindu and Greek charts. As in India, Mayan \ndivine images were painted blue and Mayan woman pierced the left \nnostril for insertion of a jewel. 12 Another version of the Creatress seems \nto have been the Mother Goddess Mayauel of the Mexican Agave, \ncalled "Woman with Four Hundred Breasts," with a strong resem- \nblance to the world-nurturing Many-Breasted Artemis and other \neastern forms of the deity who mothered all the world\'s creatures. \n\nI.

(See Cave.) \n\n\n\nMedea \n\n"Wise One," eponymous Mother Goddess of the Medes. Like \nMedusa and Metis, she was named from the Sanskrit concept of medha, \n"female wisdom." \' She was a fount of the feminine art of healing, \nand her name was related to "medicine." 2 She could restore the dead to \nlife in her magic cauldron, as shown by the myth of Aeson, who was \nso restored. Pliny called Medea a Goddess whose magic arts could \ncontrol the sun, moon, and stars. 5 She rode in a chariot drawn by \nserpents; it also had wings, to show that she ruled both earth and \nheaven. 4 \n\nAccording to Herodotus, Medea was the Great Goddess of all the \nAryan tribes of Parthia. 5 She was all- wise, and never died, but dwelt \nforever in heaven. 6 \n\n\n\n628 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe seems to have been remembered in Ireland as the Goddess Medusa \n\nMedana, associated with a sacred tree and a regenerative well, whose \n\nwaters were reputed to cure sore eyes. She was artificially canonized as a ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nsaint, and her Christian legend was copied from that of the equally \nbogus St. Lucy. 7 \n\nThe classic story of Medea\'s ill-starred marriage to Jason apparent- \nly was based on a captured idol of the Goddess.

The Argives said Medusa was a Libyan queen beheaded \nby their ancestral hero Perseus, who brought her head (or ceremonial \nmask) back to Athens. 1 \n\nActually, Medusa was the serpent-goddess of the Libyan Ama- \nzons, representing "female wisdom" (Sanskrit medha, Greek metis, \nEgyptian met ox Maat). She was the Destroyer aspect of the Triple \nGoddess called Neith in Egypt, Ath-enna or Athene in North Africa. \nHer inscription at Sais called her "mother of all the gods, whom she \nbore before childbirth existed." She was the past, present, and future: \n"All that has been, that is, and that will be." 2 So famous was this \ndescription of her that Christians later copied it on behalf of Jehovah \n(Revelation 1:8). \n\nShe said: "No mortal has yet been able to lift the veil that covers \nme," because she was Death, and to see her face to face was to die \nthat is, to be "turned to stone" as a funerary statue. She was veiled also \nbecause she was the Future, which always wears a veil. Another \nmeaning of her hidden, dangerous face was the menstrual taboo. \nPrimitive folk often believe the look of a menstruous woman can turn \na man to stone. 3 Medusa had magic blood that could create and destroy \nlife; thus she represented the dreaded life- and death-giving moon- \nblood of women (see Menstrual Blood). 4 \n\nThe Perseus story was invented to account for the appearance of \nMedusa\'s face on Athene\'s aegis, inherited from the pre-Hellenic \nperiod when Athene was actually the same Goddess (also mythologized \nas Metis, her alleged "mother"). The Athenians pretended their \nmunicipal Goddess was the "wisdom" of Zeus, born from his head. But \nolder myths said Athene was born of the Three Queens of Libya \nthat is, the Triple Goddess, of whom Metis-Medusa was the Destroyer \naspect. 5 A female face surrounded by serpent-hair was an ancient, \nwidely recognized symbol of divine female wisdom, and equally of the \n"wise blood" that supposedly gave women their divine powers. \n\n1.

Probably a title for the archaic Minerva as the \nmoon, "measurer of Time." \n\n\n\n634 \n\n\n\nenstrual Blood Menstrual Blood \n\nm the earliest human cultures, the mysterious magic of creation \n\nwas thought to reside in the blood women gave forth in apparent mi^m^^^^m \n\nharmony with the moon, and which was sometimes retained in the \n\nwomb to "coagulate" into a baby. Men regarded this blood with holy \n\ndread, as the life-essence, inexplicably shed without pain, wholly \n\nforeign to male experience. \n\nMost words for menstruation also meant such things as incompre- \nhensible, supernatural, sacred, spirit, deity. Like the Latin sacer, old \n\nArabian words for "pure" and "impure" both applied to menstrual \n\nblood and to that only. The Maoris stated explicitly that human souls \n\nare made of menstrual blood, which when retained in the womb \n\n"assumes human form and grows into a man." \' Africans said \n\nmenstrual blood is "congealed to fashion a man." 2 Aristotle said the \n\nsame: human life is made of a "coagulum" of menstrual blood. Pliny \n. icalled menstrual blood "the material substance of generation," capable \n\nof forming "a curd, which afterwards in process of time quickeneth \n\nand groweth to the form of a body." This primitive notion of the \n- ; prenatal function of menstrual blood was still taught in European \n\nI medical schools up to the 18th century. 3 \n\nBasic ideas about menstrual blood came from the Hindu theory \n\nthat as the Great Mother creates, her substance becomes thickened \n\nand forms a curd or clot; solid matter is produced as a "crust." 4 This was \n\nthe way she gave birth to the cosmos, and women employ the same \n\n- method on a smaller scale. According to Daustenius, "The fruit in the \nwomb is nourished only by the mother\'s blood. . . . [T]he menstruum \ndoes not fail the fruit for nourishment, till it at the proper time comes to \nthe light of day." 5 \n\nIndians of South America said all mankind was made of "moon \nblood" in the beginning. 6 The same idea prevailed in ancient \nMesopotamia, where the Great Goddess Ninhursag made mankind out \n... of clay and infused it with her "blood of life." Under her alternate \nnames of Mammetun or Aruru the Great, the Potter, she taught \nwomen to form clay dolls and smear them with menstrual blood as a \nconception-charm, a piece of magic that underlay the name of Adam, \nfrom the feminine adamah, meaning "bloody clay," though scholars \n\n- more delicately translate it "red earth." 7 \n\nThe Bible\'s story of Adam was lifted from an older female-oriented \ncreation myth recounting the creation of man from clay and moon- \nblood. So was the Koran\'s creation story, which said Allah "made man \nout of flowing blood"; but in pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah was the \nGoddess of creation, Al-Lat. 8 The Romans also had traces of the \n01 original creation myth. Plutarch said man was made of earth, but the \npower that made a human body grow was the moon, source of \nmenstrual blood. 9 \n\n\n\n635 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood The lives of the very gods were dependent on the miraculous \n\npower of menstrual blood. In Greece it was euphemistically called \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m the "supernatural red wine" given to the gods by Mother Hera in her \nvirgin form, as Hebe. 10 The root myths of Hinduism reveal the \nnature of this "wine." At one time all gods recognized the supremacy of \nthe Great Mother, manifesting herself as the spirit of creation (Kali- \nMaya). She "invited them to bathe in the bloody flow of her womb and \nto drink of it; and the gods, in holy communion, drank of the fountain \nof life (hie est sanguis meusl) and bathed in it, and rose blessed to \nthe heavens." \' To this day, cloths allegedly stained with the God- \ndess\'s menstrual blood are greatly prized as healing charms. 12 \nW.R. Smith reported that the value of the gum acacia as an amulet "is \nconnected with the idea that it is a clot of menstrous blood, i.e., that \nthe tree is a woman." For religious ceremonies, Australian aborigines \npainted their sacred stones, churingas, and themselves with red ochre, \ndeclaring that it was really women\'s menstrual blood. 13 \n\nThe esoteric secret of the gods was that their mystical powers of \nlongevity, authority, and creativity came from the same female \nessence. The Norse god Thor for example reached the magic land of \nenlightenment and eternal life by bathing in a river filled with the \nmenstrual blood of "giantesses" that is, of the Primal Matriarchs, \n"Powerful Ones" who governed the elder gods before Odin brought \nhis "Asians" (Aesir) out of the east. 14 Odin acquired supremacy by \nstealing and drinking the "wise blood" from the triple cauldron in the \nwomb of Mother-Earth, the same Triple Goddess known as Kali-Maya \nin southeast Asia. \n\nOdin\'s theft of menstrual magic paralleled that of Indra, who stole \nthe ambrosia of immortality in the same way. Indian myth called the \nsacred fluid Soma in Greek, "the body," because the word\'s eastern \nroot referred to a mystical substance of the body. Soma was the object \nof so much holy dread that its interpretations were many. \n\nSoma was produced by the churning of the primal sea (Kali\'s \n"ocean of blood" or sometimes "sea of milk"). Or Soma was secreted \nby the Moon-Cow. Or Soma was carried in the "white pot" (belly) of \nMohini the Enchantress. Or the source of Soma was the moon. Or \nfrom Soma all the gods were born. Or Soma was a secret name of the \nMother Goddess and the active part of the "soul of the world." 15 \n\nSoma was drunk by priests at sacrificial ceremonies and mixed with \nmilk as a healing charm; therefore it was not milk. Soma was \nespecially revered on somvara, Monday, the day of the moon. In an \nancient ceremony called Soma-vati, women of Maharashtra circum- \nambulated the sacred female-symbolic fig tree whenever the new moon \nfell on a Monday. 16 \n\nSome myths claimed the Goddess under her name of Lakshmi, \n"Fortune" or "Sovereignty," gave Soma to Indra to make him king \nof the gods. His wisdom, power, and curiously feminine capacity for \npregnancy, came from Lakshmi\'s mystic drink, "of which none tastes \n\n\n\n636 \n\n\n\nwho dwells on earth." 17 On drinking it straight from the Goddess, Indra Menstrual Blood \n\nbecame like her, the Mount of Paradise with its four rivers, "many- \n\nhued" like the Goddess\'s rainbow veils, rich in cattle and fruiting ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nvegetation. 18 The Goddess\'s blood became his wisdom. Similarly, \n\nGreeks believed the wisdom of man or god was centered in his blood, \n\nthe soul-stuff given by his mother. 19 \n\nEgyptian pharaohs became divine by ingesting "the blood of Isis," \na soma-like ambrosia called sa. zo Its hieroglyphic sign was the same as \nthe sign of the vulva, a yonic loop like the one on the ankh or Cross of \nLife. 21 Painted red, this loop signified the female genital and the Gate \nof Heaven. 22 Amulets buried with the dead specifically prayed Isis to \ndeify the deceased with her magic blood. 23 A special amulet called \nthe Tjet represented Isis\'s vulva and was formed of red substance \njasper, carnelian, red porcelain, red glass, or red wood. This amulet \nwas said to carry the redeeming power of the blood of Isis. 24 \n\nThe same elixir of immortality received the name of amrita in \nPersia. Sometimes it was called the milk of a mother Goddess, \nsometimes a fermented drink, sometimes sacred blood. Always it was \nassociated with the moon. "Dew and rain becoming vegetable sap, \nsap becoming the milk of the cow, and the milk then becoming \nconverted into blood: Amrita, water, sap, milk, and blood represent \nbut differing states of the one elixir. The vessel or cup of this immortal \nfluid is the moon." 25 \n\nCeltic kings became gods by drinking the "red mead" dispensed by \nthe Fairy Queen, Mab, whose name was formerly Medhbh or \n"mead." 26 Thus she gave a drink of herself, like Lakshmi. A Celtic \nname of this fluid was dergflaith, meaning either "red ale" or "red \nsovereignty." In Celtic Britain, to be stained with red meant to be \nchosen by the Goddess as a king. 27 Celtic ruadh meant both "red" \nand "royal." 28 \n\nThe same blood color implied apotheosis after death. The pagan \nparadise or Fairyland was at the uterine center of the earth, site of the \nmagic Fountain of Life. An old manuscript in the British Museum said \nthe dying-and-resurrected Phoenix lives there forever. The central \nHoly Mountain or mons veneris contains both male and female sym- \nbols: the Tree of Life and the Fountain of Eternal Youth, the latter \nobviously menstrual, as it was said to overflow once every lunar \nmonth. 29 \n\nMedieval churchmen insisted that the communion wine drunk by \nwitches was menstrual blood, and they may have been right. The \nfamous wizard Thomas Rhymer joined a witch cult under the tutelage \nof the Fairy Queen, who told him she had "a bottle of claret wine . . . \nhere in my lap," and invited him to lay his head in her lap. 50 Claret \nwas the traditional drink of kings and also a synonym for blood; its name \nmeant literally "enlightenment." There was a saying, "The man in \nthe moon drinks claret," connected with the idea that the wine repre- \nsented lunar blood. 31 \n\n\n\n637 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood \n\n\n\nThe Hebrew word \nfor blood, dam, means \n"mother" or \n"woman" in other \nIndo-European \nlanguages (e.g. dam, \ndamsel, madam, la \ndama, dame) and also \n"the curse" (damn). \nThe Sumerian Great \nMother represented \nmaternal blood and \nbore names like \nDam-kina, \nDamgalnunna. \nFrom her belly flowed \nthe Four Rivers of \nParadise, sometimes \ncalled rivers of blood \nwhich is the "life" of all \nflesh. Her firstborn \nchild, the Savior, was \nDamu, a "child of \nthe blood." 37 Damos or \n"mother-blood" was \nthe word for "the \npeople" in \n\nmatriarchal Mycenae. 58 \nAnother common \nancient symbol of the \nblood-river of life was \nthe red carpet, \ntraditionally trod by \nsacred kings, heroes, \nand brides.\' 9 \n\n\n\nMedieval romance and the courtly-love movement, later related to \nwitch cults, were strongly influenced by the Tantric tradition, in \nwhich menstrual blood was indeed the wine of poets and sages. It is still \nspecified in the Left Hand Rite of Tantra that the priestess imperson- \nating the Goddess must be menstruating, and after contact with her a \nman may perform rites that will make him "a great poet, a Lord of \nthe World" who travels on elephant-back like a rajah. 32 \n\nIn ancient societies both east and west, menstrual blood carried the \nspirit of sovereign authority because it was the medium of transmis- \nsion of the life of clan or tribe. Among the Ashanti, girl children are still \nmore prized than boys because a girl is the carrier of "blood" \n(mogya). The concept is also clearly defined in India, where menstru- \nal blood is known as the Kula flower or Kula nectar, which has an \nintimate connection with the life of the family. When a girl first \nmenstruates, she is said to have "borne the Flower." 34 The corre- \nsponding English word flower has the significant literal meaning of \n"that which flows." \n\nThe British Goddess of flowers was Blodeuwedd, a form of the \nTriple Goddess associated with sacrifices of ancient kings. Welsh \nlegend said her whole body was made of flowers as any body was, \naccording to the ancient theory of body formation from the blood \n"flower." Her name suggests the Blood Wedding, and myth made her \nthe spouse of several murdered heroes, recalling the old idea that the \nGoddess\'s divine blood had to be periodically refreshed by human \nsacrifice. 35 \n\nThe Bible also calls menstrual blood the flower (Leviticus \n1 5:24), precursor of the "fruit" of the womb (a child). As any flower \nmysteriously contained its future fruit, so uterine blood was the \nmoon-flower supposed to contain the soul of future generations. This \nwas a central idea in the matrilineal concept of the clan. 36 \n\nThe Chinese religion of Tao, "the Way," taught Tantric doctrines \nlater supplanted by patriarchal-ascetic Confucianism. Taoists said a \nman could become immortal (or at least long-lived) by absorbing \nmenstrual blood, called red yin juice, from a woman\'s Mysterious \nGateway, otherwise known as the Grotto of the White Tiger, symbol of \nlife-giving female energy. Chinese sages called this red juice the \nessence of Mother Earth, the yin principle that gives life to all things. \nThey claimed the Yellow Emperor became a god by absorbing the \nyin juice of twelve hundred women. 40 \n\nA Chinese myth said the Moon-goddess Chang-O, who controlled \nmenstruation, was offended by male jealousy of her powers. She left \nher husband, who quarreled with her because she had all the elixir of \nimmortality, and he had none, and was resentful. She turned her back \non him and went to live in the moon forever, in much the same way \nthat Lilith left Adam to live by herself at the "Red Sea." Chang-0 \nforbade men to attend Chinese moon festivals, which were afterward \ncelebrated by women only, at the full moon of the autumnal \nequinox. 41 \n\n\n\n638 \n\n\n\nTaoist China considered red a sacred color associated with women, Menstrual Blood \n\nblood, sexual potency, and creative power. White was the color of \n\nmen, semen, negative influences, passivity, and death. 42 This was the ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nbasic Tantric idea of male and female essences: the male principle \nwas seen as "passive" and "quiescent"; the female principle as "active" \nand "creative," the reverse of later patriarchal views. 43 \n\nFemale blood color alone was often considered a potent magic \ncharm. The Maori rendered anything sacred by coloring it red, \nand calling the red color menstrual blood. 44 Andaman Islanders thought \nblood-red paint a powerful medicine, and painted sick people red all \nover in an effort to cure them. 45 Hottentots addressed their Mother \nGoddess as one "who has painted thy body red"; she was divine \nbecause she never dropped or wasted menstrual blood. 46 Some African \ntribes believed that menstrual blood alone, kept in a covered pot for \nnine months, had the power to turn itself into a baby. 47 \n\nEaster eggs, classic womb-symbols of the Goddess Eostre, were \ntraditionally colored red and laid on graves to strengthen the dead. \nThis habit, common in Greece and southern Russia, might be traced all \nthe way back to Paleolithic graves and funeral furnishings reddened \nwith ochre, for a closer resemblance to the Earth Mother\'s womb from \nwhich the dead could be "born again." Ancient tombs everywhere \nhave shown the bones of the dead covered with red ochre. Sometimes \neverything in the tomb, including the walls, had the red color. \nJ.D. Evans described a well tomb on Malta filled with reddened bones, \nwhich struck fear into the workmen who insisted the bones were \ncovered with "fresh blood." 48 \n\nA born-again ceremony from Australia showed that the Aborigines \nlinked rebirth with the blood of the womb. The chant performed at \nAnkota, the "vulva of the earth," emphasized the redness surrounding \nthe worshipper: "A straight track is gaping open before me. An \nunderground hollow is gaping before me. A cavernous pathway is \ngaping before me. An underground pathway is gaping before me. \nRed I am like the heart of a flame of fire. Red, too, is the hollow in \nwhich I am resting." 49 Images like these help explain why some of \nthe oldest images of the Goddess, like Kurukulla in the east and her \ncounterpart Cybele in the west, were associated with both caverns \nand redness. 50 \n\nGreek mystics were "born again" out of the river Styx, otherwise \nknown as Alpha, "the Beginning." This river wound seven times \nthrough the earth\'s interior and emerged at a yonic shrine near the city \nof Clitor (Greek kleitoris) sacred to the Great Mother. 51 Styx was the \nblood-stream from the earth\'s vagina; its waters were credited with the \nsame dread powers as menstrual blood. Olympian gods swore their \nabsolutely binding oaths by the waters of Styx, as men on earth swore by \nthe blood of their mothers. Symbolic death and rebirth were linked \nwith baptism in the waters of Styx, as in many other sacred rivers the \nworld over. Jesus himself was baptized in Palestine\'s version of the \nStyx, the river Jordan. When a man bathed seven times in this river, \n\n\n\n639 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood "his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child" (2 Kings \n\n5:14). In Greek tradition the journey to the land of death meant \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ crossing the Styx; in Judeo-Christian tradition it was crossing the \n\nJordan. This was the same "river of blood" crossed by Thomas Rhymei \non his way to Fairyland. \n\nTantric worship of menstrual blood penetrated the Greco-Roman \nworld before the Christian era and was well established in the Gnostic \nperiod. This worship provided the agape "love-feast" or "spiritual \nmarriage" practiced by Gnostic Christians like the Ophites. Anoth- \ner name for the agape was synesaktism, "the Way of Shaktism," \nmeaning Tantric yoni-worship. 52 Synesaktism was declared a heresy \nbefore the 7th century a.d. 53 Subsequently the "love-feast" disappearec \nand women were forbidden direct participation in Christian worship, \naccording to St. Paul\'s rule (1 Timothy 2:1 1-12). \n\nEpiphanius described the agape practiced by Ophite Christians, \nwhile making it clear that these heretical sexual activities filled him \nwith horror: \n\nTheir women they share in common; and when anyone arrives who \nmight be alien to their doctrine, the men and women have a sign by \nwhich they make themselves known to each other. When they extend \ntheir hands, apparently in greeting, they tickle the other\'s palm in a \ncertain way and so discover whether the new arrival belongs to their cult. \n. . . Husbands separate from their wives, and a man will say to his own \nspouse, "Arise and celebrate the love feast (agape,) with thy brother. " \nAnd the wretches mingle with each other . . . after they have consorted \n\ntogether in a passionate debauch The woman and the man take \n\nthe man s ejaculation into their hands, stand up . . . offering to the Fathei \nthe Primal Being of All Nature, what is on their hands, with the words, \n"We bring to Thee this oblation, which is the very Body of Christ. " \n. . . They consume it, take housel of their shame and say: "This is the \nBody of Christ, the Paschal Sacrifice through which our bodies suffer \nand are forced to confess to the sufferings of Christ. "And when the \nwoman is in her period, they do likewise with her menstruation. The \nunclean flow of blood, which they garner, they take up in the same way \nand eat together. And that, they say, is Christ\'s Blood. For when they \nread in Revelation, "I saw the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, \nyielding its fruit each month " (Rev. 22:2), they interpret this as an \nallusion to the monthly incidence of the female period. M \n\nThe meaning of this Ophite sacrament to its practitioners is \neasily recovered from Tantric parallels. Eating the living substances of \nreproduction was considered more "spiritual" than eating the dead \nbody of the god, even in the transmuted form of bread and wine, \nthough the color symbolism was the same: \n\nWhen the semen, made molten by the fire of great passion, falls into the \nlotus of the "mother" and mixes with her red element, he achieves \n"the conventional mandala of the thought of enlightenment. " The \nresultant mixture is tasted by the united "father-mother" [Yab- Yum], \nand when it reaches the throat they can generate concretely a special bin \n\n\n\n640 \n\n\n\n::c \n\n\n\n. . . the bodhicitta the drop resulting from union of semen and Menstrual Blood \n\nmenstrual blood is transferred to the yogi This empowers his \n\ncorresponding mystic veins and centers to accomplish the Buddha\'s \n\nfunction of speech. The term "secret initiation " comes from the tasting of ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe secret substance. yy \n\nIn the occult language of the Tantras, two ingredients of the \nGreat Rite were sukra, semen, and rakta, menstrual blood. The officiat- \ning priestess had to be menstruous so her lunar energies were at flood \ntide. 56 She embodied the power of rakta, sometimes rendered rukh or \nruq, cognate with the Hebrew ruach, "spirit," and the Arabic ruh, \nwhich meant both "spirit" and "red color." Throughout all Tantric and \nrelated faiths, the merging of female red and male white was "a \nprofoundly important symbolic conjunction." 57 \n\nThe Sufis, who practiced their own brand of Tantrism, said ruh \nwas female and red. Its male counterpart sin, "consciousness," was \nwhite. Red and white colors alternated in the Sufi halka or magic circle, \ncorresponding to the Tantric chakra and called "the basic unit and \nvery heart of active Sufism." The Arab rosary of alternating red and \nwhite beads had the same meaning: men and women coupled around \nthe circle, as in most European folk dances. 58 \n\nRed and white were the colors worn by alternating female-and- \nmale dancers in the witches\' "fairy ring" of pagan Ireland, where the \nGoddess was worshipped under the same name as the Tantric earth \nmother, Tara. 59 With men and women alternating as in a Tantric \nchakra, the dance moved counterclockwise or moonwise, as nearly all \ncircle dances still do. Red and white colors "represented the fairy \nworld." 60 \n\nThe rites were often governed by old women, due to the ancient \nbelief that post-menopausal women were the wisest of mortals be- \ncause they permanently retained their "wise blood." In the 17th century \na.d., Christian writers still insisted that old women were filled with \nmagic power because their menstrual blood remained in their veins. 61 \nThis was the real reason why old women were constantly persecuted \nfor witchcraft. The same "magic blood" that made them leaders in the \nancient clan system made them objects of fear under the new \npatriarchal faith. \n\nBecause menstrual blood occupied a central position in matriar- \nchal theologies, and was already sacer holy-dreadful \npatriarchal-ascetic thinkers showed almost hysterical fear of it. The \nLaws of Manu said if a man even approached a menstruating woman he \nwould lose his wisdom, energy, sight, strength, and vitality. The \nTalmud said if a menstruating woman walked between two men, one of \nthe men would surely die. 62 Brahmans ruled that a man who lay with \na menstruating woman must suffer a punishment one-quarter as severe \nas the punishment for Brahmanicide, which was the worst crime a \nBrahman could imagine. Vedic myths were designed to support the law, \njj iuch as the myth that Vishnu dared copulate with the Goddess Earth \n\n\n\n641 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood while she was menstruating, which caused her to give birth to monsters \n\nwho nearly destroyed the world. 63 \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m This was patriarchal propaganda against the Tantric Maharutti \n\n("Great Rite"), in which menstrual blood was the essential ingredi- \nent. In Kali\'s cave-temple, her image spouted the blood of sacrifices \nfrom its vaginal orifice to bathe Shiva\'s holy phallus while the two \ndeities formed the lingam-yoni, and worshippers followed suit, in an \norgy designed to support the cosmic life-force generated by union of \nmale and female, white and red. 64 In this Great Rite, Shiva became the \nAnointed One, as were his many Middle-Eastern counterparts. The \nGreek translation of Anointed One was Christos. \n\nPersian patriarchs followed the Brahman lead in maintaining that \nmenstruous women must be avoided like poison. They belonged to \nthe devil; they were forbidden to look at the sun, to sit in water, to speal \nto a man, or to behold an altar fire. 65 The glance of a menstruous \nwoman was feared like the glance of the Gorgon. Zoroastrians held tha \nany man who lay with a menstruating woman would beget a demon, \nand would be punished in hell by having filth poured into his mouth. 66 \n\nPersian religion incorporated the common primitive belief that th< \nfirst onset of menses must be caused by copulation with a supernatu- \nral snake. People not yet aware of fatherhood have supposed the same \nsnake renders each woman fertile and helps her conceive children. 67 \nSome such belief prevailed in Minoan Crete, where women and snake! \nwere sacred, but men were not. Tube-shaped Cretan vessels for \npouring oblations represented a vagina, with a serpent crawling inside. 6 \nAncient languages gave the serpent the same name as Eve, a name \nmeaning "Life"; and the most ancient myths made the primal couple \nnot a Goddess and a God, but a Goddess and a Serpent. 69 The \nGoddess\'s womb was a garden of paradise in which the serpent lived. \n\nPhrygian Ophiogeneis, "Snake-born People," said their first male \nancestor was the Great Serpent who dwelt in the garden of para- \ndise. 70 Paradise was a name of the Goddess-as- Virgin, identified with \nMother Hera (Earth), whose virgin form was Hebe, a Greek spelling \nof Eve. Virgin Hera parthenogenetically conceived the oracular serpen \nPython, of the "Womb-temple," Delphi. 71 Snakes living in the \nwomb of Mother Earth were supposed to possess all wisdom, being in \ncontact with the "wise blood" of the world. \n\nOne of the secrets shared by the primordial woman and her \nserpent was the secret of menstruation. Persians claimed menstrua- \ntion was brought into the world by the first mother, whom they called \nJahi the Whore, a Lilith-like defier of the Heavenly Father. She \nbegan to menstruate for the first time after coupling with Ahriman, the \nGreat Serpent. Afterward she seduced "the first righteous man," who \nhad previously lived alone in the garden of paradise with only the divin< \nsacrificial bull for company. He knew nothing of sex until Jahi taught \nhim. 72 \n\n\n\n642 \n\n\n\nV.\'jfc \n\n\n\nThe Jews borrowed many details from these Persian myths. Menstrual Blood \n\nRabbinical tradition said Eve began to menstruate only after she had \n\ncopulated with the serpent in Eden, and Adam was ignorant of sex until ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nEve taught him. 75 It was widely believed that Eve\'s firstborn son Cain \nwas not begotten by Adam but by the serpent. 74 Beliefs connecting \nserpents with pregnancy and menstruation appeared throughout \nEurope for many centuries. Up to modern times, German peasants still \nheld that women could be impregnated by snakes. 75 \n\nWhether initiated by a serpent or not, menstrual bleeding inspired \ndeadly fear among both Persian and Jewish patriarchs (Leviticus 1 5). \nRachel successfully stole her father\'s teraphim (household gods) by \nhiding them under a camel saddle and sitting on it, telling her father \nshe was menstruating so he dared not approach her (Genesis 3 1). To \nthis day, orthodox Jews refuse to shake hands with a woman because \nshe might be menstruating. Jews also adopted a rule apparently laid \ndown by Hesiod, that a man must never wash in the same water \npreviously used by a woman, lest it might contain a trace of menstrual \nblood. 76 \n\nThere were many similar taboos. The ancient world\'s most dread- \ned poison was the "moon-dew" collected by Thessalian witches, said \nto be a girl\'s first menstrual blood shed during an eclipse of the moon. 77 \nPliny said a menstruous woman\'s touch could blast the fruits of the \nfield, sour wine, cloud mirrors, rust iron, and blunt the edges of knives. 78 \nIf a menstruous woman so much as laid a finger on a beehive, the \nbees would fly away and never return. 79 If a man lay with a menstruous \nwoman during an eclipse, he would soon fall sick and die. 80 \n\nChristians inherited all the ancient patriarchs\' superstitious horrors. \nSt. Jerome wrote: "Nothing is so unclean as a woman in her periods; \nwhat she touches she causes to become unclean." Penitential regula- \ntions laid down in the 7th century by Theodore, Bishop of \nCanterbury, forbade menstruating women to take communion or even \nenter a church. At the French Synod of Meaux, menstruous women \nwere specifically forbidden to come to church. From the 8th to the 11th \ncenturies, many church laws denied menstruating women any access \nto church buildings. As late as 1684 it was still ordered that women in \ntheir "fluxes" must remain outside the church door. 81 In 1298 the \nSynod of Wiirzburg commanded men not to approach a menstruating \nwoman. 82 The superstition came down to the 20th century, when a \nScottish medical text quoted an old rhyme to the effect that menstrual \nblood could destroy the entire world: \n\nOh! Menstruating woman, thou \'rt a fiend \n\nFrom which all nature should be closely screened. 83 \n\nChristian women were commanded to despise the "unclean- \nness" of their own bodies, as in the Rule for Anchoresses: "Art thou not \nformed of foul slime? Art thou not always full of uncleanness?" 84 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n643 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Blood \n\n\n\nDr. Augustus Kins- \nley Gardner Eminent \nphysician of the late \n19th century, opponent \nof all forms of birth \ncontrol, which he \nclaimed led "directly \nand indisputably" to \nnervous diseases and \ndebilities. \n\n\n\nMedical authorities of the 16th century were still repeating the old belief \nthat "demons were produced from menstrual flux." 85 One of the \n"demons" born of menstrual blood was the legendary basilisk with its \npoisonous glance. 86 The legend evidently arose from the classic myth \nof the Gorgon with her serpent-hair and wise blood, petrifying men \nwith her glance. The Gorgon and the red cross of menstrual blood \nonce marked the most potent taboos. 87 The very word taboo, from \nPolynesian tupua, "sacred, magical," applied specifically to menstrual \nblood. 88 \n\nJust as primitives attributed beneficial powers to menstrual blood \nalong with its fearfulness, so medieval peasants thought it could heal, \nnourish, and fertilize. 89 Some believed a menstruating woman could \nprotect a crop by walking around the field, or exposing her genitals in \nit. 90 Peasant women carried seed to the fields in rags stained with their \nmenstrual blood: a continuation of the custom of Eleusinian fertility- \npriestesses. 91 Even doctors thought menstrual blood could cure leprosy, \nor act as a powerful aphrodisiac. Madame de Montespan used it to en- \ncourage the ardor of her royal lover, Louis XIV. 92 Gypsies said a woman \ncould win any man\'s love with a potion of her own menstrual blood. 93 \n\nAs the former medium of reincarnation, menstrual blood was \nsometimes called a remedy for death itself. In the tale of Childe Roland, \nthe elven-king roused men from the magic sleep of death with a "bright \nred liquor." 94 Early romances associated this universal heal-all with "the \nblood of a noble virgin," as a wise-woman revealed to Galahad. 95 The \nsame belief impelled Louis XI to try to stave off death by drinking \nyoung girls\' blood. \n\nVictorian superstition taught that a child conceived during a \nmenstrual period would be born with a caul, and would have occult \npowers. 96 Nineteenth-century doctors inherited their predecessors\' no- \ntions of witchcraft and evil, and so maintained that menstruating \nwomen are not healthy; copulation with them could infect a man with \nurethritis or gonorrhea. Dr. Augustus Gardner said venereal diseases \nwere usually communicated from women to men, not vice versa. 97 \nSpeaking of savages\' menstrual taboos, anthropologists described the \nwomen as "out of order," "suffering from monthly illness," or "stricken \nwith the malady common to their sex." 98 A doctor wrote even in the \npresent century: "We cannot too emphatically urge the importance of \nregarding these monthly returns as periods of ill health, as days when \nthe ordinary occupations are to be suspended or modified." 99 \n\nAt the present time just as in the Middle Ages, the Catholic church \nstill considers itself on firm theological ground by advancing, as an \nargument against ordination of women, the notion that a menstruating \npriestess would "pollute" the altar. This would not preclude ordination \nof post-menopausal women, but different excuses are found for those. \nThe holy "blood of life" used to be feminine and real; now it is \nmasculine and symbolic. \n\n\n\n644 \n\n\n\n1.

The \nthirteen annual lunations of the latter produced one of the contrasting \nanswers to the nursery-rhyme riddle: "How many months be in the \nyear? There be thirteen, I say." Christians produced another answer: \n"There be but twelve, I say." The lunar calendar\'s thirteen 28-day \nmonths had four 7-day weeks apiece, marking new, waxing, full, and \nwaning moon-sabbaths in the ancient form. Weeks are still lunar, but \nthey no longer fit neatly into the solar month system. Thirteen lunar \nmonths gave 364 days per year (1 3 X 28), with one extra day to \nmake 365. Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, witch charms, ballads and other \nrepositories of pagan tradition nearly always describe the full annual \ncycle as "a year and a day." \n\nIt has been shown that calendar consciousness developed first in \nwomen, because of their natural menstrual body calendar, correlated \nwith observations of the moon\'s phases. Chinese women established a \nlunar calendar 3000 years ago, dividing the celestial sphere into 28 \nstellar "mansions" through which the moon passed. Among the \nMaya of central America, every woman knew "the great Maya calendar \nhad first been based on her menstrual cycles." * Romans called the \n\n\n\n645 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Calendar calculation of time mensuration, i.e., knowledge of the menses. Gaelic \n\nwords for "menstruation" and "calendar" are the same: miosach and \n^^^^^^^^^^^ miosachan. The new-moon sabbaths of ancient Latium were kalends, \npossibly related to the Aryan name of Kali. For fear of disrupting the \nGoddess\'s transitions, activities of some kinds were forbidden on the \nseventh day of each lunar phase; thus sabbaths became "unlucky" or \ntaboo. Because it was the time-honored custom, even the biblical God \nwas forced to "rest" on the seventh day. \n\nOne of the prototypes of Yahweh was the Babylonian god Mar- \nduk, who divided the maternal "waters" into those above and below \nthe firmament (Genesis 1:7). Marduk claimed to be the creator, but was \nnot yet so patriarchal as to abandon his Mother\'s lunar calendar. \nBabylonian priests said Marduk established holy days and seasons by the \nmoon. 2 Yet older traditions said the menstrual calendar was instituted \nin Babylon by the god Nabu-Rimmani, the biblical Baal-Rimmon, a \nphallic deity united with the Great Mother\'s yoni in the form of a \npomegranate. 3 \n\nThe Chinese explained their menstrual calendar with the myth of \nthe holy calendar plant, lik-kiep, on which a pod grew every day for \n14 days, then a pod fell off every day for 14 days. When the months be- \ncame confused by solar reckoning, the Chinese added extra days \nwhen "a pod withered without falling off." 4 \n\nAccording to another story, the menstrual calendar was called \nHsiu, "Houses." The Moon Mother rested each night of the lunar \nmonth in a different one of her 28 houses, which were kept by the 28 \nwarrior-hero consorts she had placed in heaven to attend her. 5 \n\nThe ancient Hebrews took their calendar from Chaldea, legendary \nhome of Abraham, whose older name was Ab-sin, "Moon-father." 6 \nChaldeans were credited with the invention of astrology, now largely \nbased on the movements of the sun; but the Chaldeans didn\'t study \nthe sun. They were "Moon-worshippers," believing the moon deter- \nmined the fates of men by her movements through various "houses" \nof the zodiac. The same lunar myths were found in Egypt, northern \nEurope, Greece, and Rome. Latin kings were sacrificed at the three- \nday dark of the moon period called ides, to insure the Goddess\'s safe \nreturn from the underworld. Greeks similarly made offerings at the \nGreat Sabbath called Noumenia (New Moon). The other Great Sab- \nbath was Dichomenia (Full Moon), when the Goddess stood at the \npeak of her cycle. 7 \n\nEarly attempts at calendar reform left Greek city-states quarreling \namong themselves about sabbaths and intercalary days. Aristopha- \nnes\'s The Clouds makes the Moon-goddess complain that her \nreckoning of the days was not being correctly followed. 8 Time-spans \nin myths became confused. Adonis was born after "ten months\' gesta- \ntion," which really meant ten lunar months, the normal 280 days. 9 \nAccording to the Book of Maccabees, every gestation lasted ten \nmonths. 10 This wasn\'t ignorance; it was just lunar reckoning. \n\n\n\n646 \n\n\n\nLEven the saints\' days of the medieval church were established by Menstrual Calendar \n\nenology, literally "knowledge of the moon." The church\'s so-called \nmovable feasts were movable because they were determined by lunar ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ncycles, not solar ones; thus they drifted erratically through the months \nof the canonical calendar. The most important of them, Easter, is still \ndetermined by the moon (first Sunday after the first full moon after \nthe spring equinox), at a time when the Goddess slew and re-conceived \nthe Savior or vegetation god for a new season. 11 \n\nMore confusion was created by the fact that menstrual calendars \nreckoned the day from noon to noon, with the midnight hour in the \ncentral position; but solar calendars reckoned the day from midnight to \nmidnight. The Saxon word den (day) really meant "night." In \nShakespeare\'s time, people said goodnight by wishing each other good \nden, literally good moon-day. Old French nursery rhymes greeted \nthe moon rising in the evening with "Good morning, Madame \nMoon." n The meridian or high point of noon used to indicate the \nfull moon overhead at midnight: hence its name Meri-Dia or Mary- \nDiana, the Moon-goddess. Superstitious folk talked of the \ndaemonium meridianum, devil of the meridian, a diabolization of the \nGoddess. 13 She was probably the second of the Slavic trinity of Fates \n(Zorya), called "She of the Evening, She of Midnight, and She of \nMorning," in that order. 14 \n\nPagans held their festivals at night, by moonlight: a custom that \nmight be traced as far back as ancient Egypt, where major religious \nceremonies were nocturnal, as listed in the Book of the Dead: \n\nThe night of the battle and of the overthrow of the Sebau-Beld in Tattu \n. . . , the night of waking to stand up the double Tet in Sekhem . . . , the \nnight of establishing Horus in the heritage of the things of his father in \nRekhti . . . , the night when Isis maketh lamentation at the side of her \nbrother Osiris in Abtu . . . , the night of the Haker festival when a division \nis made between the dead and the spirits who are on the path of the dead \n. . . , the night of the judgment of those who are to be annihilated at the \ngreat festival of the ploughing and the turning up of the earth. ls \n\nPre-Christian Europe also gave night precedence over day. \nGermanic tribes, Celts, Gauls, druids, the ancient Irish calculated \n"months, years, and birthdays in such a way as to make the night \nprecede the day." 16 Caesar noted that the Celts measured time by \nnights instead of by days. 17 \n\nChristian holy days were copied from pagan ones, displaced by 12 \nhours in their solar reckoning; therefore the older, heathen version of \neach festival was celebrated on the "Eve" of its Christian counterpart. \nFrom this arose the so-called devilish rites of May Eve, Midsummer \nEve, Lammas Eve, All Hallow\'s Eve, and Christmas Eve which was \ntaken from the pagan Yule, and to a late date was still called the \nNight of the Mother. 18 \n\nWitch persecutors pretended the witches copied their sabbats from \nChristian feast days in deliberate mockery of the church; but in fact \n\n\n\n647 \n\n\n\nMenstrual Calendar the copying had gone in the other direction. The church took over the \n\npagan feasts of Halloween, May Day, Lammas, Imbolg, Midsum- \n^^^^^^^^^^^ mer, Easter, Yule, and so on, then claimed to have invented them. \nHowever, of the two rival festivals on the same day, the Christian one \nwas invariably the newcomer. 19 \n\nMay Eve was the Saxons\' Walpurgisnacht, the Celts\' Beltain, \nannouncing the opening of the Merry Month of sexual license and \n"wearing of the green" in honor of the earth\'s new spring garment. The \noccasion was still marked by pagan ceremonies in the late 16th \ncentury. 20 (See May.) Midsummer Eve merged with St. John\'s Day, \nbut the solstitial rites remained more pagan than Christian. Lammas \nEve was a witches\' Great Sabbat because it was formerly the pagan \nFeast of Bread (Hlaf-mass) in honor of the Corn-mother. 21 Hallow- \neen was All Hallows\' or All Souls\' eve, from the Celtic Samhain or \nFeast of the Dead, when pagan ancestors came forth from their fairy- \nmounds, and Christians called them "demons" who attended the \nwitches\' feasts. 22 \n\nThe thirteen months of the menstrual calendar also led to \npagan reverence for the number 13, and Christian detestation of it. \nWitches\' "covens" were supposed to be groups of 1 3 like the moon- \nworshipping dancers of the Moorish zabat (sabbat), to whom thirteen \nexpressed the three-in-one nature of the lunar Goddess. 23 \n\nSome said thirteen was a bad number because Christ was the \nthirteenth in the group of apostles, thus the thirteenth member of any \ngroup would be condemned to death. Actually, it was the church\'s \nopposition to pagan symbolism that brought opprobrium on the \nnumber 1 3. Some even feared to speak its true name, and it was \neuphemized as a "baker\'s dozen," or sometimes "devil\'s dozen." 24 \n\nThe heathen tradition persisted in such symbols as the Thirteen \nTreasures of Britain, probably lunar-month signs taken from a primi- \ntive list of zodiacal constellations. They were defined as a sword, basket, \ndrinking horn, chariot, halter, knife, cauldron, whetstone, garment, \npan, platter, chessboard, and mantle. 25 The thirteen menstrual months \nwere symbolized in the Tarxien temple on Malta as a sow with 1 3 \nteats, like the Celts\' Sow-goddess Cerridwen. 26 Thirteen "moons" of \nthe menstrual calendar were suggested also by the English Twelfth \nNight custom of kindling twelve small fires and one large one, to \nrepresent the moon of the New Year. 27 \n\nIn general, the symbols of ancient matriarchy came to be known as \nnight, the moon, and the number 13, while those of patriarchy were \nday, the sun, and the number 12. \n\n1.

See Yama. \n\n\n\nMerlin \n\nDruidic wizard associated with the fairy-religion, later thinly Chris- \ntianized as the resident wise-man of King Arthur\'s court. Old Welsh \ntraditions called Merlin a "wild man of the woods" with prophetic or \nshamanistic skills; he was named either Lailoken or Myrrdin. Geoffrey \nof Monmouth said Merlin\'s earlier name was Ambrosius, associating \nhim with the female-symbolic "ambrosia" given by the Fairy Queen to \nher chosen bards and magicians. 1 In medieval falconry, a merlin was \na kind of hawk that could be flown only by a lady. 2 \n\nMerlin learned all his magic from the Goddess, in the guise of \nMorgan le Fay, or Viviane (She Who Lives), or the Lady of the \nLake. At the end of his life she took him back into her magic cave and \nwrapped him in deathless sleep until his Second Coming. Here she \nwas called Nimue, or Fate, the same as the Moon-goddess Diana \nNemorensis, or the Nemesis of the Greeks. Pagan Britons believed \nMerlin would return from his enchanted sleep to announce the coming \nof a new age of peace and fertility. \n\nChristian writers however made Merlin a child of the powers of \n\n\n\n650 \n\n\n\n[hell. According to Robert de Borron, Merlin was deliberately con- \nceived to become Antichrist; he was fathered on a virgin by a devil. He \npossessed a benevolent nature because of his mother\'s goodness, \nwhich prevailed over his demonic nature. \n\nWhen King Vortigern\'s temple was being built on Salisbury Plain, \nIthe structure persisted in falling down because so the astrologers \njsaid its foundations needed the blood of a child who had no human \njfather. Young Merlin fitted the description and was brought to be \nisacrificed; but his magical X-ray vision discovered the real cause of the \ntrouble. A red and a white dragon were fighting in a mystic pool \nunder the temple\'s foundations. Merlin prophesied from this that \niVortigern, the Welsh red dragon, would be slain by Uther Pendrag- \npn, the British white dragon; and it so happened. Afterward, Merlin \nbuilt Stonehenge by himself, in one night calling all its massive stones \nfrom Ireland with his magic songs. 3 \n\nMerlin was also an artisan and a smith. He forged King Arthur\'s \nmagic armor and a wonderful cup identified with the Holy Grail. He \nbuilt the palace at Camelot. 4 He made the Round Table, symbol of the \npagan lunar calendar. The first tally of its knights made up the \n(moon\'s number, 28. 5 \n\nThe Round Table seems to have been derived from the sacred \nmensa, calendar-table, of Vesta. Petronius said it was a Round Table \nwith the Goddess\'s image in its center. It represented the earth, which \nt Anaximenes described as "like a Table in form." Plato\'s Symposium \nsaid the table stood for Mother Earth because "besides feeding us it is \nround in shape, it is fixed, and very suitably it has been given by some \ni me name of Hestia." 6 \n\nMerlin\'s secret cave was located either in the Breton fairy-wood of \nBroceliande, or in the British druidic shrine of Mount Ambrosius. \nSome said this was Chislehurst, a chalk cliff honeycombed with caves, \n||ong occupied by a college of druidesses. 7 Merlin was associated with \n:he druidic Goddess under many of her names: Morgan, Viviane, \n[Nimue, Fairy Queen, Lady of the Lake the Celtic Water-goddess \nMuirgen, often called boine clergesse (the Good Priestess). Because \nVIerlin was clearly connected with Goddess worship and the mass of \nMerlin literature was for centuries a vehicle for criticism of the church, \nin the 16th century the Council of Trent placed the Book of Merlin\'s \n[Predictions on the Index of Prohibited Books. 8 \n\n1.

Then in 1847 it was discovered that "mesmer- \nized" people tended to have religious experiences, and to claim powers \nof clairvoyance and prophecy. Therefore the church declared hereti- \ncal "those who profess to see things which are invisible ... or apply \npurely physical principles to things which are in reality supernatural." \nFinally in 1856 an encyclical letter warned the clergy that mesmerism \nwas a dangerous "error." \' It was a good example of the church\'s \nrefusal to admit any source of spiritual illumination or mythic imagery \nother than its own. \n\n1. Bromberg, 164. \n\n\n\nMessiah \n\nPersian title of the Anointed One (Greek Christos) supposed to come \nto earth just before doomsday; based on the Kalki Avatara, final \nincarnation of Buddha, due to appear in time to save the virtuous, \nbefore destruction of this universe. 1 \n\nPersians sometimes identified the Messiah with the virgin-born \nprophet Zoroaster, who would return as his own reincarnation or \n"son" just before the final battle of the God of Light and the God of \nDarkness (Ahura Mazda and Ahriman). 2 \n\nThe Jews called the Messiah "Mashiach," and identified him with \nElijah. Passover ceremonies required four cups of wine, one left \nuntasted. This was the Cup of Elijah which would be mysteriously \ndrained before the Second Coming. During the Middle Ages, the \nhopes of oppressed Jewry were raised from time to time by a report that \nsomeone\'s Cup of Elijah had been emptied by a miracle. 3 \n\nThe Talmud spoke of two Messiahs; Messiah ben David and \nMessiah ben Joseph. For this reason, Christian genealogies tried to \nmake Jesus both of them at once, through his mother Mary of the house \nof David, and through his father Joseph. Some versions of the \nGospels said Joseph was Jesus\'s natural father, other versions said he war \n\n\n\n652 \n\n\n\nI not. 4 Like the Persian Messiah he was also the mutually contradictory Metis \n\nSon of Man and Son of God.

Older versions of the \nnyth show that Metis was really Medusa, whose Gorgon face and \n;nake hair symbolized Female Wisdom. Athene was the virgin form of \nhe same Goddess, born not from Zeus\'s head but from the triple \nGorgon in the land of Libyan Amazons, who worshipped Medusa- \nvletis as the Mother of Fate. 1 A later, Gnostic-Christian version of \n:he same Goddess was Sophia, whose name also meant "Wisdom." \n1.

See \nOmphalos. \n\nl.Lethaby, 62. \n\n\n\nMidwifery \n\nFrom Anglo-Saxon med-wyf, "wise-woman" or "witch." Even in the \nChristian era, priestesses of the Great Mother maintained their monop- \noly of obstetrics, for most men were afraid of the taboo mysteries of \nbirth. The Bible declared a new mother sacer or untouchable for as long \nas 66 days after giving birth (Leviticus 12:5); and by canon law, a \nmother was not allowed to enter a church until 40 days after childbed. \n\n\n\n654 \n\n\n\nFor the first half of the Christian era, the arts of medicine Midwifery \n\ntemained almost exclusively in the hands of "wise-women" because \n\nindent healing shrines had been devoted almost exclusively to the ^_^^^_^___ \n\ngoddess\'s priestesses. 1 In ancient Egypt, midwifery was the province \n>f Sevenfold Hathor who gave each infant its seven souls. The Malayan \nSemai still say all midwives are holy, partaking of the spirit of the First \nVlidwife who lives in the highest of the seven heavens, each one of \nvhich is ruled by one of the Seven Celestial Midwives, identical with \nhe Hathors. An earthly midwife is a sort of fairy godmother, with a \npiritual tie to each child she brings into the world. 2 \n\nMexican peasants attribute similar powers to the recibidora who \nombines the functions of obstetrician, godmother, priestess, and \nvitch. She performs complicated knot-magic in binding and tying the \nimbilical cord and casts spells for the future fate of the newborn. 3 \n\nPagan Rome recognized several kinds of midwives, who received \n;eparate offerings after a successful birth. There was the obstetrix \nvho performed the delivery; the nutrix or "nurturer" who encouraged \n[he mother\'s milk and taught techniques of nursing; and the ceraria, \njxiestess of Ceres charged with birth rituals. 4 All were connected with \n[he women\'s temple, like the Greek Horae who were temple-women \npn earth and ascended to heaven as midwives to the gods. \n\nMedieval Christianity detested midwives for their connections with \nDagan matriarchy and Goddess-worship. Churchmen viewed them as \nmplacable enemies of the Catholic faith. Handbooks of the Inquisition \nirtated: "No one does more harm to the Catholic faith than mid- \nlives," because they invariably offered newborn children to the service \n)f the devil with a magical baptism by the kitchen fire. 5 The real \nreason for ecclesiastical hostility seems to have been the notion that \nmidwives could help women control their own fate, learn secrets of \n;ex and birth control, or procure abortions. The pagan women of \nantiquity had considerable knowledge of such matters, which were \n:onsidered women\'s own business, not subject to male authority. 6 \nPatriarchal religion however forbade midwives to assist their patients \nn preventing conception, relieving themselves of unwanted pregnan- \nes, or easing their birth-pangs. \n\nIn 1 591 a Scottish noblewoman, Eufame Macalyne, was burned \nalive for asking a witch-midwife for drugs to ease her labor pains. 7 \nParliamentary Articles of Enquiry in 1559 ordered churchwardens to \njreport any use of "charms, sorcery, enchantments, invocations, \ncircles, witchcrafts, soothsaying," or any like procedures "especially in \nkhe time of women\'s travails." 8 \n\nSome charms and sorceries were allowed as long as they were of \nthe Christian variety: that is, with Christian names substituted for \npagan ones in the formulae. Women in childbed were officially advised \nito bind around their thighs a long charm in Latin, beginning In \nnomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus SanctiAmen, followed by invocations \nof saints and secret names of God. If the names were not Christian, \n\n\n\n655 \n\n\n\nMidwifery however, the charm was devilish. An episcopal injunction of 1 5 54 said \n\nmidwives must not "use or exercise any witchcraft, charms, sorcery, \n^^^^^^^^^^^^ invocations, or prayers other than such as be allowable and may stand \nwith the laws and ordinances of the Catholic church." 9 \n\nChristianity\'s official view was that to relieve women\'s sufferings in \nany aspect of reproduction was to oppose God\'s will in the matter of \nthe curse on Eve. God decreed that she and all her female descendants \nmust bring forth children with "sorrow" (pain). Consequently, up to \nthe beginning of the 20th century, doctors refused to consider treatment \nof the major cause of women\'s deaths, childbed (puerperal) fever. \nThe clergy held such deaths to be either a just reward for an immoral \nlife, or the expression of God\'s continuing judgment on "the sex." I0 \n\nWhen James Simpson proposed to relieve women\'s labor pains \nwith the newly discovered anesthetics, chloroform and ether, there \nwas a great outcry from the clergy, who called it a sinful denial of God\'s \nwishes. According to Scottish clergymen, to relieve labor pains would \nbe "vitiating the primal curse against woman." n A New England \nminister wrote: "Chloroform is a decoy of Satan, apparently offering \nitself to bless women; but in the end it will harden society and rob God \nof the deep earnest cries which arise in time of trouble, for help." 12 \nWith the usual half-concealed sadism of patriarchal morality, he was \nreally saying that female screams of pain gave God pleasure, and men \nmust see to it that God was not deprived of this. \n\nThe matter was resolved when Queen Victoria allowed her doctor \nto give her chloroform during delivery of her eighth child, and \npublicly hailed the new pain-reliever as a great blessing. All at once the \nclergymen were silenced, in effect conceding to the Queen the right \nto overrule God. 13 \n\nToward the end of the 19th century, male doctors moved in on \nthe last remaining area of exclusively female medicine, and took the \nmidwifery-trade away from women. At the instigation of the American \nMedical Association, the U.S. Congress outlawed midwives, and the \nnew male "obstetricians" replaced them. Frequently, an elder midwife \nfound herself out of work, or even in jail for illegal practice, in a \ncommunity most of whose members she had brought into the world! 14 \n\nThe effects of the new male professionalism were not always \nbeneficial: \n\nOur mechanized civilization, in the interest of a speedy delivery, at the \nconvenience, even at the timed participation of the physician, often \nendangered mother and child with impatient interference in the natural \nprocess, and too often compounded this mistake by anesthetizing the \nmother completely. All too soon, as a result of scientific pride over \ninventing a formula for feeding independent of the natural source of \nmilk, the child was parted from its mother and deprived not only of \nmother\'s milk, but of the experience of a warm, loving, commensal \nrelationship with her, the kind we must have also with Mother Earth. ,s \n\nThe male-dominated medical profession not only took up delivering \n\n\n\n656 \n\n\n\nLvomen\'s babies, but even presumed to teach women how to "mother" Milky Way \n\ni:hem which often led to terrible mistakes like the tum-of-the-century \n\nminimal-handling theory, which assumed that crying children must not ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n3e "spoiled" by cuddling them but should be picked up only at \npredetermined infrequent intervals. Perhaps the ultimate hubris was \nattained by L.K. Frank who wrote: "The psychiatrist is uniquely \nCompetent to tell us how to practice the Christian injunction to love \nlittle children." 16 Here is modern "education" ignorant of the histori- \ncal truth that the very existence of the human race depended for \nbountless thousands of years long before either Christianity or \npsychiatry were heard of on the unique ability of mothers to love little \nIchildren and of "wise-women" to assist the instincts of motherhood. \n\n1.

Ionians said \nthe stars came from the udder of their own Moon-Cow, Io, "the \nMoon." 2 Others said the Moon-Cow was Europa, consort of Zeus as a \ntotemic white bull. All white Moon-Cows were the same Goddess, \nknown from India to Scandinavia as the nourisher of the world and the \nmother of the star-spirits. 3 See Cow. \n\nThe Four Rivers of Paradise were supposed to pour from the four \n(teats of the Moon-Cow\'s udder. Norsemen said these rivers came \nfrom the udder of Audumla, the Nourisher, a divine cow who existed \nbefore any other creature. 4 She was identified with Mana, the Moon \nMother. Scandinavian mythology knew the Milky Way as Manavegr, \n"Moon-Way." 5 To the Celts, it was Bothar-bo finne, Track of the \nWhite Cow. 6 The primordial white cow whose udder produced the \nstar-rivers was almost certainly the same cow who "jumped over the \nmoon" in the nursery rhyme, because she was shown hovering over the \nmoon in pre-Christian icons. \n\nAkkadians called the Milky Way River-of-the-Divine-Lady, or \nHiddagal, the Great River, which the Bible rendered Hiddekel \n(Genesis 2:14). Arabians called the Milky Way Umm alSama, Mother \nof the Sky. 7 Egyptians called the Milky Way the "Nile in the Sky," \nwhich poured from the udder of the Moon-Cow, Hathor-Isis, who thus \ngave rain to the rest of the world, though she reserved her "true \nNile" for Egypt. \n\nClassic mythology made the galactic mother Gala-Tea, "Milk \nGoddess," a white statue of Aphrodite carved by her priest-consort \n\n\n\n657 \n\n\n\nMimemata Pygmalion, whose name was a Greek form of Pumiyathon, priest- \n\nMiniato, Saint consort of Astarte-Hathor at Byblos. 8 Alternatively, the galaxy spurted \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m from the breasts of Hera when she suckled Heracles; or else it came \nfrom the breasts of Rhea when she suckled Zeus. 9 Names differed, \nbut everywhere the Milky Way was regarded as the Goddess\'s star-milk, \nwhich formed curds to create worlds and creatures. \n\nThe Rabelaisian statement that the moon is made of green cheese \ndates back to old legends of the moon\'s creation as a ball of cheese \ncurdled from the Milky Way. 10 Sometimes it was the earth that was \nmade of green cheese from the Goddess\'s milk. The Bible copied a \nformer address to the Goddess: "Hast thou not poured me out as milk, \nand curdled me like cheese?" (Job 10:10). \n\nAnglo-Saxon names for the Milky Way suggested that it was not \nonly a river but also a main street of heaven.

Mariamne, \nMiriamne \n\n\n\n659 \n\n\n\nMirror St. Miriamne said to be a daughter of St. Philip, himself once the pagan \n\ngod of May Day. 1 See Mari; Mary. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ 1 . Brewster, 221. \n\n\n\nMirror \n\nThe ancients attributed mystic powers to any reflective surface, solid \nor liquid, because the reflection was considered part of the soul. Heavy \ntaboos were laid on the act of disturbing water into which a person \nwas gazing, because shattering the image meant danger to the soul. \nHence the similar taboo on breaking a mirror, now said to bring \nseven years\' bad luck. \n\nDamage to the reflection-soul was the real basis of the myth of \nNarcissus, usually misinterpreted as a fable of excessive self-love. \nNarcissus couldn\'t bear to leave the reflection of his beautiful face in th< \nmagic pool of the nymph Echo, and so he pined away and died, and \nturned into a flower on the bank. Echo also pined until nothing \nremained of her but a voice. Actually, Echo was the Goddess of \ndeath-by-water, who lay in wait to seize one\'s reflection-soul, according \nto beliefs still current among Africans and Melanesians. 1 Narcissus \nwas another name of the sacrificed springtime-flower hero also called \nAntheus, Adonis, Hyacinthus, or Dionysus, who died at the May \nDay Heroantheia (Hero-flowering) in Crete, Mycenae, and \nLacedaemon. 2 \n\nA mirror meant the god\'s death in the Pelasgian myth of Dionysus \nThe Titans trapped his soul in a mirror, as the soul of Narcissus was \ntrapped in reflective water. Then Dionysus was torn to pieces in the rite \nof the omophagy (see Cannibalism). Many centuries later, the \ngypsies repeated a tale of Dionysus transformed into the Enchanted or \nAccursed Hunter, whose soul was trapped in a mirror by a "witch" \nMara, the same as the Hindu death-spirit Mara. 3 Among Slavic gypsies, \nMara or Mora was a destroying Fate-goddess who rode the night \nwinds and "drank the blood of men." 4 \n\nThe tragically deceased Narcissus was taken into the Christian \ncanon as a saint, said to have been a "bishop" of Jerusalem in the first \ncentury (when there were no bishops of Jerusalem). Instead of dying \nlike his ephebic namesake at the pinnacle of youth and beauty, St. \nNarcissus lived to be 116 years old. 5 He was one of the pseudosaints \nwhose legend was supposed to convince the pagans that the Christian \nfaith could grant the gift of longevity. \n\nMirrors were connected with death in many Christian supersti- i \ntions. Demons, werewolves, vampires, and such "soulless" creatures \nshowed no reflection in a mirror. Many Europeans still turn mirrors to \nthe wall after a death in the house, in the belief that mirrors trap the \nsouls of the living or detain the souls of the dead on their journey. 6 \nSome say one who looks in a mirror in a house of death will see not \n\n\n\n660 \n\n\n\nhis own face but the face of the deceased. 7 Pope John XXII had an Mistletoe \n\ninordinate fear of mirrors; he claimed wizards sent devils to attack \n\nhim through mirrors. 8 ^ ^^ \n\nThe so-called witch\'s mirror could be made of polished stone, a \nsheet of metal, a crystal, or a bowl of water or ink. Water represented \nthe Abyss, the numinous hidden spirit world; its reflections therefore \ncould be read as shadows cast ahead by future events. In fairy tales, \nthe land of souls often appeared as a hall of mirrors. 9 \n\nCabalists professed to read the will of the seven planetary spirits in \nseven mirrors, each made of the appropriate metal for its day, its \ndeity, and its subject matter. Questions about the great folk of the earth \nwere addressed to a golden mirror on Sun-day. Dreams and mystic \nenlightenment were observed on Monday (Moon-day) with a mirror of \nsilver. Enmities and lawsuits were resolved on Tuesday with a Mars \nmirror of iron. A Mercury mirror of quicksilver in glass was consulted \non Wednesday about money matters. A Jupiter mirror of tin was \nquestioned on Thursday about worldly successes. Questions of love \nwere resolved on Friday with a Venus mirror of copper. Lost articles \nand secrets could be discovered on Saturday by a Saturn mirror of \nlead. 10 \n\nThe esoteric meaning of the mirror was explained long ago by \nPlotinus, who connected it with the Hindu concept of Maya, crea- \ntress of the "reflections" of spiritual reality in the mirror of the material \nworld. "Matter serves as a mirror upon which the Universal Soul \nprojects the images or reflections of its creations, and thus gives rise to \nthe phenomena of the sensible universe." n \n\nOriental mystics were close to the conclusion that the Universal \n\nSoul really meant one\'s own soul, where reality was perceived as in a \n\nmirror, darkly. A Buddhist aphorism said: "All existence is like a \n\nreflection in a mirror, without substance, only a phantom of the \n\nmind. When the finite mind acts, then all kinds of things arise; when the \n\nfinite mind ceases to act, then all kinds of things cease." 12 In other \n\nwords, the world exists only for those who live and perceive it. This was \n\nan idea that Western philosophers played with endlessly, even to the \n\nlogical but irrational idea that if there were no intelligent beings to \n\nperceive it, the universe would not exist at all. \n\n1.

The gold color of dry mistletoe was seen as a \nsymbol of apotheosis, as was gold metal. The living plant was viewed \nas the genitalia of the oak god, Zeus or Jupiter or Dianus of Dodona, \n\n\n\n661 \n\n\n\nMistletoe consort of the Moon-mother Diana Nemetona, Lady of the Grove. \n\nAt the season of sacrifice, druidic priests ceremonially castrated the oak \n^^^^^^^^^^^ god by cutting off his mistletoe with a golden moon-sickle, catching it \nin a white cloth before it could touch the ground, so it remained like \nevery sacrificial deity "between heaven and earth." \' \n\nThe phallic significance of mistletoe probably stemmed from the \nnotion that its whitish berries were semen-drops, as the red berries of \nits feminine counterpart, holly, were equated with the Goddess\'s men- \nstrual blood. Among Indo-European peoples generally, castration of \nthe god was customary before his immolation. \n\nSacred-oak cults continued throughout the Christian era. In the \n8th century a.d., the Hessians worshipped the oak god at Geismar \nand gave hjs holy tree the name of Jove (Jupiter). As late as 1874, an an- \ncient oak-tree shrine in Russia was worshipped by a congregation led \nby an Orthodox priest. Wax candles were affixed to the tree, and the \ncelebrants prayed, "Holy Oak Hallelujah, pray for us." A drunken \norgy ensued. 2 Modern customs of kissing under the mistletoe are pale \nshadows of the sexual orgies that once accompanied the rites of the \noak god. \n\nTo Nordic pagans, mistletoe symbolized the death of the savior- \ngod Balder, son of Odin, whose Second Coming was expected after \ndoomsday, when he would return to earth to establish the new creation. \nBalder was slain by a spear of mistletoe wielded by Hod, the Blind \nGod, another name for Odin himself. Or, some said Hod was Balder\'s \ndark twin, corresponding to the light-and-dark year-gods Set and \nHorus in Egypt. 3 \n\nSome derive the Saxon mis-el-tu from Mas, the Sanskrit "Messi- \nah" (Vishnu), and tal, a pit, metaphorically the earth\'s womb. Thus it \nstood for the god\'s entry into his Mother-bride. Norsemen\'s word for \nmistletoe was Guidhel, the same "guide to hell" as Virgil\'s Golden \nBough. 4 \n\nAfter they were converted to Christianity, Saxons claimed the \nmistletoe was "the forbidden tree in the middle of the trees of Eden," \ni.e., the Tree of Knowledge, which was Ropularly supposed to have \nfurnished the wood for Jesus\'s cross. 5 \n\nThe phallic meaning of the mistletoe made it the "key" that \nopened the underworld womb, key and phallus being interchange- \nable in mystical writings. Some treatises said, "All locks are opened by \nthe herb Missell toe." Combined with the "feminine" herb Alcyone, \nit "makes a man do often the act of generation." 6 \n\nThe pagan\'s interpretations of mistletoe were still understood in \nRenaissance times, when it was adopted as an emblem of the new \nMessiah and "carried to the high altar" of English churches on \nChristmas Eve. But some Christian writers insisted that the mistletoe \n"never entered those sacred edifices but by mistake, or ignorance of the \n\n\n\n662 \n\n\n\njjxtons; for it was the heathenish and profane plant, as having been of Mithra \n\nbch distinction in the pagan rites of Druidism." 7 \n\n1.

In 307 a.d. the emperor officially designated \nMithra "Protector of the Empire." l \n\nChristians copied many details of the Mithraic mystery-religion, \nxplaining the resemblance later with their favorite argument, that \nle devil had anticipated the true faith by imitating it before Christ\'s \nirth. Some resemblances between Christianity and Mithraism were \n3 close that even St. Augustine declared the priests of Mithra wor- \nlipped the same deity as he did. 2 \n\nMithra was born on the 25th of December, called "Birthday of the \nle Unconquered Sun," which was finally taken over by Christians in \nle 4th century a.d. as the birthday of Christ. 3 Some said Mithra sprang \nom an incestuous union between the sun god and his own mother, \nist as Jesus, who was God, was born of the Mother of God. Some \nlaimed Mithra\'s mother was a mortal virgin. Others said Mithra had \no mother, but was miraculously born of a female Rock, the petra \nenetrix, fertilized by the Heavenly Father\'s phallic lightning. 4 \n\nMithra\'s birth was witnessed by shepherds and by Magi who \njrought gifts to his sacred birth-cave of the Rock. 5 Mithra performed \nne usual assortment of miracles: raising the dead, healing the sick, \nlaking the blind see and the lame walk, casting out devils. As a \nleter, son of the petra, he carried the keys of the kingdom of heaven \nlee Peter, Saint). 6 His triumph and ascension to heaven were \ndeb rated at the spring equinox (Easter), when the sun rises toward its \npogee. \n\nBefore returning to heaven, Mithra celebrated a Last Supper with \nis twelve disciples, who represented the twelve signs of the zodiac, \ni memory of this, his worshippers partook of a sacramental meal of \nread marked with a cross. 7 This was one of seven Mithraic sacra- \nlents, the models for the Christians\' seven sacraments. 8 It was called \nlizd, Latin missa, English mass. Mithra\'s image was buried in a rock \n>mb, the same sacred cave that represented his Mother\'s womb. He \n\'as withdrawn from it and said to live again. 9 \n\nLike early Christianity, Mithraism was an ascetic, anti-female \niligion. Its priesthood consisted of celibate men only. 10 Women \n-ere forbidden to enter Mithraic temples. 11 The women of Mithraic \n\n\n\n663 \n\n\n\nMithra families had nothing to do with the men\'s cult, but attended services \n\nof the Great Mother in their own temples of Isis, Diana, or Juno. 12 \n\nmm ^^^^ mmg ^ l ^ m To eliminate the female principle from their creation myth, \n\nMithraists replaced the Mother of All Living in the primal garden of \nparadise (Pairidaeza) with the bull named Sole-Created. Instead of Eve \nthis bull was the partner of the first man. All creatures were born \nfrom the bull\'s blood. Yet the bull\'s birth-giving was oddly female- \nimitative. The animal was castrated and sacrificed, and its blood was \ndelivered to the moon for magical fructification, the moon being the \nsource of women\'s magic lunar "blood of life" that produced real \nchildren on earth. 13 \n\nPersians have been called the Puritans of the heathen world. The] \ndeveloped Mithraism out of an earlier Aryan religion that was not so \npuritanical or so exclusively male-oriented. 14 Mithra seems to have bee \nthe Indo-Iranian sun god Mitra, or Mitravaruna, one of the the \ntwelve zodiacal sons of the Infinity-goddess Aditi. Another of Aditi\'s \nsons was Aryaman, eponymous ancestor of "Aryans," whom the \nPersians transformed into Ahriman, the Great Serpent of Darkness, \nMithra\'s enemy. 15 \n\nEarly on, there seems to have been a feminine Mithra. Herodotus \nsaid the Persians used to have a sky-goddess Mitra, the same as \nMylitta, Assyria\'s Great Mother. 16 Lydians combined Mithra with his \narchaic spouse Anahita as an androgynous Mithra-Anahita, identified \nwith Sabazius-Anaitis, the Serpent and Dove of Anatolian mystery \ncults. 17 \n\nAnahita was the Mother of Waters, traditional spouse of the solar \ngod whom she bore, loved, and swallowed up. She was identified \nwith the Anatolian Great Goddess Ma. Mithra was naturally coupled \nwith her, as her opposite, a spirit of fire, light, and the sun. 18 Her \n"element," water, overwhelmed the world in the primordial flood, \nwhen one man built an ark and saved himself, together with his cattle, \naccording to Mithraic myth. 19 The story seems to have been based on \nthe Hindu Flood of Manu, transmitted through Persian and Babylo- \nnian scriptures to appear in a late, rather corrupt version in the Old \nTestament. See Flood. \n\nWhat began in water would end in fire, according to Mithraic \neschatology. The great battle between the forces of light and darkness \nin the Last Days would destroy the earth with its upheavals and \nburnings. Virtuous ones who followed the teachings of the Mithraic \npriesthood would join the spirits of light and be saved. Sinful ones who v \nfollowed other teachings would be cast into hell with Ahriman and \nthe fallen angels. The Christian notion of salvation was almost wholly a \nproduct of this Persian eschatology, adopted by Semitic eremites and \nsun-cultists like the Essenes, and by Roman military men who thought \nthe rigid discipline and vivid battle-imagery of Mithraism appropriate ] \n\n\n\n664 \n\n\n\nfor warriors. Under emperors like Julian and Commodus, Mithra Mffi \n\nbecame the supreme patron of Roman armies. 20 Mnemosyne \n\nAfter extensive contact with Mithraism, Christians also began to _^^__^^____ \n\ndescribe themselves as soldiers for Christ; to call their savior Light of \nthe World, Helios the Rising Sun, and Sun of Righteousness; to \ncelebrate their feasts on Sun-day rather than the Jewish sabbath; to \nclaim their savior\'s death was marked by an eclipse of the sun; and to \nadopt the seven Mithraic sacraments. Like Mithraists, Christians \npracticed baptism to ascend after death through the planetary spheres to \nthe highest heaven, while the wicked (unbaptized) would be dragged \ndown to darkness. 21 \n\nMithra\'s cave-temple on the Vatican Hill was seized by Christians \nn 376 ad. 22 Christian bishops of Rome pre-empted even the Mithraic \nft nigh priest\'s title of Pater Patrum, which became Papa, or Pope. 23 \nMithraism entered into many doctrines of Manichean Christianity \njnd continued to influence its old rival for over a thousand years. 24 The \nMithraic festival of Epiphany, marking the arrival of sun-priests or \n\nPagi at the Savior\'s birthplace, was adopted by the Christian church \nly as late as 8 1 3 a.d. 25 \n\nI.

Later popes carried on the pagan tradition \n\\y blessing Christian amulets and holy medals which were also used \np trade, like money. 1 \n\nThe attendant spirit of Juno Moneta was the erotic Cupid, \n^responding to the Greeks\' Eros, who was both child and compan- \npn of Aphrodite. Thus, "cupidity" used to mean erotic desire, but in \nChristian times its meaning was changed to greed for money. \n\n1 .

Vetter comments: \n\nOne might well ask, where is the evidence that the worship of one \nsupreme god is so superior to the worship of several gods? that is \nunless one takes the position that it is difficult enough to furnish proof of \nthe existence of one god, and that each additional god assumed to exist \nwould simply double the problem faced. If the reduction in numbers of \ndeities of itself has merit, then why are not those religions in which no \ngods whatever are worshipped the "highest" of all?\' \n\n\n\n667 \n\n\n\nMons Veneris There was nothing lofty about the original impulse toward \n\nmonotheism: the conceit of kings who identified themselves with a god \n\ni^^^HBM and demanded that god\'s supremacy. One of the earliest self- \nworshipping monotheists was the Egyptian pharaoh Ikhnaton \n(Akhenaten), who reigned from 1379 to 1362 B.C. \n\nIkhnaton decided that the sole supreme deity was Aton, symbol- \nized by the sun disc and incarnate on earth in himself. He moved his \nfamily and court to an earthly paradise 300 miles north of Thebes, to a \nsite now called Tell el Amarna, a great city and temple-palace. He \nordered even the word "gods" removed from inscriptions throughout \nthe land, so his own divine alter ego reigned alone. Jewish monothe- \nism probably originated in Egypt. The Old Testament contains writings \ncopied from the cult of Aton, especially the 104th Psalm, thought to \nhave been written by Ikhnaton himself. \n\nEgyptian priesthoods of the old deities refused to tolerate the royal i \nmonotheism. Ikhnaton died mysteriously. His body disappeared, and \nwasn\'t buried in the tomb prepared for it. His name was erased from \nking lists. He was described as a criminal. 2 The Egyptians plainly \nwere not disposed to call monotheism a "higher" religion. \n\nAnother self- worshipper was the Roman emperor Elagabalus (He-- \nliogabalus), who identified himself with the solar god El Gabal, and \ntried to absorb all other deities into a single faith. He built a temple on \nthe Palatine, "and he desired to bring into that temple the image of \nthe Magna Mater and the fire of Vesta and the Palladium and the \nshields and all things that were sacred to the Romans; and he strove to \nbring it to pass that no god save El Gabal should be worshipped in \nRome." 3 But the Roman people were not ready to limit themselves \nto El Gabal or any other single god. \n\nFifty years later, Aurelian erected in the Campus Martius his greati \ntemple to the Mithraic sun god, Deus Sol Invictus, the only god. \nDiocletian also declared this god Rome\'s sole ruling deity. Mithraism \nalmost succeeded in establishing Roman monotheism. Mithra was \nadored "from the mouth of the Danube to Hadrian\'s Wall in Britain, \nfrom Hadrian\'s Wall to the Pillars of Hercules, and from the Pillars of \nHercules to the Desert of Sahara." Moesia, Dacia, Pannonia, and \nNoricum adopted the cult, as did southern France, especially Lyons. I \nMithraic inscriptions and sanctuaries have been found at Ostia, Naples, \nPalermo, Syracuse, Spoleto, and other sites. 4 See Mithra. \n\nl.Vetter, 206-7. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Ikhnaton." 3.

Medical terminology still calls the \npubic area mons veneris. Medieval Europe had mountains of the \n\n\n\n668 \n\n\n\nsame name. Pope Pius II said witches met by night on Mons Veneris \n(German Venusberg) to consult demons and learn magic. 1 \n\nl.Wedeck, 160. \n\n\n\nMontanism \nMoon \n\n\n\nMontanism \n\njChristian sect founded by Montanus, a former priest of Cybele. \nBecause it allowed women to prophesy and preach, Montanism was \ndeclared a heresy and suppressed. 1 \n\nl.Reinach,278. \n\n\n\nMontsalvatch \n\n\'Mount of Salvation," the Temple of the Holy Grail vaguely located \nn the Pyrenees. This was probably an alternate name for the fortress of \nhe heretical Cathari at Montsegur in the Pyrenees, where members \n)f the sect were trapped and beseiged for years by papal armies, until the \nbrtress was finally captured and destroyed in 1244. 1 The Grail \nemple was supposed to be the residence of Knights Templar who rode \north to the assistance of ladies in distress. 2 See Grail, Holy. \n\n1. See Oldenbourg, Massacre at Montsegur. 2. Guerber, L.M.A., 200. \n\n\n\nBoon \n\n\'Egyptian priests style the moon the Mother of the Universe," \n\'lutarch said, because the moon, "having the light which makes moist \nnd pregnant, is promotive of the generation of living beings and the \nructification of plants." l Upper Egypt used to be called Khemennu, \nLand of the Moon." 2 In worship of the heavenly bodies, primacy \n/as always assigned to the moon. 3 Babylonians gave the moon prece- \nlence over the sun. Oriental nations in general worshipped the moon \npore the sun. 4 Moses Maimonides said moon worship was the religion \n|f Adam. 5 The Gnostic sect of Naassians believed in a primordial \neing known as "the heavenly horn of the moon." 6 The moon was the \nternal Great Mother. In central Asia it was said the moon is the \n| Joddess\'s mirror reflecting everything in the world, like the mirror of \nlaya. 7 \n\nMany savages revere the moon more than the sun, reasoning that \nle Moon-mother gives her light at night, when it is needed, whereas \nie sun shines only by day. This belief presupposes that sunlight and \naylight are not the same, a common idea among primitives. 8 Writers \nthe Bible made this same mistake. They said God created "light" \nlaylight) before the sun and moon (Genesis 1:5, 16). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD \n\n\n\nMoon \n\n\n\n669 \n\n\n\nMoon \n\n\n\nMana or men gave \nthe name of the pre- \nRoman Latin \nGoddess Menrva \n(Minerva), and such \nwords as mentality, \nmenstrual, menol- \nogy, mensuration, \nmentor, menage (a \nmatrilineal household), \nomen (a revelation \nfrom the moon), and \namen (the moon of \nrebirth). \n\n\n\nAshanti people had a generic term for all deities, Boshun, \n"Moon." In the Basque language, the words for "deity" and "moon" \nwere the same. Sioux Indians called the moon "The Old Woman Who \nNever Dies." Iroquois called her "The Eternal One." 9 Rulers in the \nEritrean zone of South Africa bore the Goddess\'s name, "Moon." 10 \nAncient rulers of the Tutsi tribe were named Mwezi, "Moon." n \nThe Gaelic name of the moon, gealach, came from Gala or Galata, \noriginal Moon-mother of Gaelic and Gaulish tribes. Britain used to \nbe called Albion, the Milk-white Moon-goddess. Persians called the \nmoon Metra (Matra, mother), "whose love penetrated \neverywhere." 12 \n\nThe root word for both "moon" and "mind" was the Indo- \nEuropean manas, mana, or men, representing the Great Mother\'s \n"wise blood" in women, governed by the moon. 13 Its derivative mania \nused to mearl ecstatic revelation, just as lunacy used to mean \npossession by the spirit of Luna, the moon. 14 To be "moon-touched" 01 \n"moon-struck" meant to be chosen by the Goddess; a "moon-calf" \nwas one carried away by love of her. When patriarchal thinkers belittled \nthe Goddess, these words came to mean mere craziness. The \nmoonstruck person was described as "silly," a word that formerly meant \n"blessed," possibly derived from Selene, the Moon. 15 \n\nTo the Greeks, menos meant both "moon" and "power." To the \nRomans, the morality of the Moon-goddess was superior to that of \nthe Sun-god. Plutarch said, "The effects of the moon are similar to the \neffects of reason and wisdom, whereas those of the sun appear to be \nbrought about by physical force and violence." 16 \n\nIn many cultures, the Moon-goddess and the Creatress were one \nand the same. Polynesians called the Creatress Hina, "Moon." She \nwas the first woman, and every woman is a wahine, made in the image \nof Hina. 17 To the Finns, the Creatress was Luonnotar (Luna, the \nMoon). She brooded over the sea until she brought forth the World \nEgg, heaven, and earth. 18 Scandinavians sometimes called the Crea- j \ntress Mardoll, "Moon Shining Over the Sea." 19 \n\nThe Moon-goddess created time, with all its cycles of creation, \ngrowth, decline, and destruction, which is why ancient calendars \nwere based on phases of the moon and menstrual cycles (see Men- \nstrual Calendar). The moon still determines agricultural work in \nsome parts of India. 20 Indonesian moon priestesses were responsible for I \nfinding the right phase of the moon for every undertaking. The \nDayaks prayed to the moon for children, increase of cattle, and \nabundant crops; they said she was the cause and measurer of time. 21 \nGreeks said the same of Demeter, whose priests were called Sons of the j \nMoon. 22 \n\nPeruvians called the moon either Mama Quilla or Mama Ogllo, ; \nsometimes identifying the two as mother and daughter, like Demeter I \nand Kore. Mama Quilla married the sun and gave birth to Mama Ogllol \n"Egg," the moon-maiden and her brother the sun-man. These two \n\n\n\n670 \n\n\n\nmated and founded the Inca royal line on the site of Cuzco, "the Moon \n\nNavel," in Inca cosmology the center of the world. 23 \n\nBecause the Moon-goddess was threefold, the Destroyer as well as ^_.^_^^^_ \nthe Creator, she was the devourer of the dead as well as the giver of \nlife. In Mexico her Destroyer aspect was Mictecaciuatl, who roamed the \nskies at night, seeking victims to devour. She was called Lady of the \nPlace of the Dead, in appearance like Kali the Destroyer. She was not \nonly the moon but also the All-mother from whose genital hole in the \nearth humanity crawled in the beginning, and to which humanity would \nreturn. 24 \n\nThe Vedas say all souls return to the moon after death, to be \ndevoured by maternal spirits. 25 Trobriand Islanders spoke of these \nspirits as "female sorcerers" associated with the moon, eaters of the \ndead. 26 Maoris called the Moon Mother "man-eater." Tartars of \ncentral Asia worshipped the moon as Macha Alia, Queen of Life and \nDeath, said to be an eater of men. Africans said the moon searched \nfor men to devour. 27 \n\nOrphic and Pythagorean sects viewed the moon as the home of \nthe dead, a female Gate (yoni) through which souls passed on the way \nto the paradise-fields of the stars. 28 Greeks often located the Elysian \nFields, home of the blessed dead, in the moon. 29 Kastor of Rhodes said \nthe shoes of Roman senators were decorated with ivory lunules \n(crescents) to show that after death they would inhabit the moon. 30 \nRoman religion taught that "the souls of the just are purified in the \nmoon." 31 Wearing the crescent was "visible worship" of the Goddess. 32 \nThat was why the prophet Isaiah denounced the women of Zion for \nwearing lunar amulets (Isaiah 3:18). "The crescent moon worn by \nDiana and used in the worship of other Goddesses is said to be the \nArk or vessel of boat-like shape, symbol of fertility or the Container of \njthe Germ of all life." 33 The same Ark carried gods, like Osiris, into \ndeath; which may account for Jeremiah\'s hostility to the Ark\'s symbol- \nfern (Jeremiah 3:16). \n\nSemites feared the devouring Old Moon as Hindus feared the \ndevouring Kalika. Her dual nature may account for the correlation \nbetween Semitic ima, "mother," and e-mah, "terror." 34 Superstitious \nChristians sometimes refused to sleep where moonlight might touch \njthem. According to Roger Bacon, "Many have died from not protecting \nthemselves from the rays of the moon." 35 There was always an \nissociation with death: \n\nThe idea of the journey to the moon after death is one which has been \npreserved in the more advanced cultures. . . . It is not difficult to find \n. . . themes of the moon as the Land of the Dead or the regenerating \nreceptacle of souls. . . . This is one reason why the moon presides over \nthe formations of organisms, and also over their decomposition. i6 \n\nBecause the moon was the receptacle of souls between reincar- \nnations, it sheltered both the dead and the unborn, who were one and \n\n\n\n671 \n\n\n\nMoon \n\n\n\nDigby mystery play \n\nEnglish Renaissance \npassion play, Mary \nMagdalene, by an \nanonymous author \ntentatively identified as \nMiles Blomefylde. \n\n\n\nthe same. Believers in prophetic dreams said if a man dreamed of his \nown image in the moon, he would become the father of a son. If a \nwoman dreamed of her own image in the moon, she would give birth \nto a daughter. 57 \n\nMost important for its association with birth, the moon was \nsupposed to be the receptacle of menstrual blood by which each \nmother formed the life of her child. This sacer, taboo moon-fluid kep \neven the gods alive. The moon was "the cup of the fluid of life \nimmortal, quickening the vegetable realm and whatsoever grows in the \nsub-lunar sphere, quickening also the immortals on high." 38 \n\nMany myths of the moon-journey bore witness to the ancient \nbelief in lunar heavens. Gypsies opposed the Christian savior with \ntheir own Romany savior who carried souls to the moon, like Hermes \nPsychopomp. 39 Strangest of all myths of the moon-journey was one \ninvolving Jesus himself. The Digby mystery play of the 1 6th century \nquoted "Jesus\'s hymn to the Moon, his mother, the vessel ... in \nwhom he rested before he ascended to the Sun." 40 \n\nPeasants in France and Portugal confused Jesus\'s mother with thi \nMoon-goddess, whom they called "Our Lady" and "Mother of \nGod." 41 Scottish women curtsied to the moon when they saw her, \nsaying "It is a fine moon, God bless her." 42 In the Loire district, \nchildren\'s rhymes spoke of Madame Moon, giver of babies. 43 A medi- \neval German sect of Cathari worshipped the moon as Heva (Eve), \nMother of All Living, an older incarnation of the virgin Mary. 44 Even \nthe orthodox church held that, as Jesus was the second Adam, so \nMary was the second Eve; and Mary was associated with both the moon \nand the sea. \n\nAs the moon governs the sea\'s tides, so she was supposed to goverr \nthe tides of life and death. Shore dwellers had an ineradicable \nconviction that a baby can be born only on an incoming tide, and a \ndying person cannot expire until the tide goes out. As a corollary, it \nwas often said birth at a full tide or a full moon betokens a lucky life. 45 \nThe soul may ride the tide in lunar form, according to Caesarius of \nHeisterbach: "The soul is a spiritual substance of spherical nature, like \nthe globe of the moon." 46 \n\nScottish girls refused to schedule a wedding day for any time othei \nthan the full moon, the most fortunate time for women. 47 Scandina- \nvian women particularly prized amulets made of silver, the moon metal. \nThe moon was the special deity of women even during the Renais- \nsance, when it was said if a woman wanted anything she should not ask \nGod but should pray instead to the moon. 48 \n\nWitches invoked their Goddess by "drawing down the moon," a \nrite dating back to moon-worshipping Thessaly, centuries before the \nChristian era. 49 Thessalian priestesses also prefigured "witchcraft" by \nlaying curses with "moon-dew," said to be the first menstrual blood \nof girls gathered during a lunar eclipse. 50 Medieval folk believed such a \n\n\n\n672 \n\n\n\ncurse incurable. St. Augustine and other fathers of the church Moon \n\njbelieved what Virgil said about moon-priestesses, that they could draw \n\ndown the moon, stop rivers in their courses, turn back the wheel of ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe stars, or bring trees marching downhill. 51 St. Augustine berated \n\nwomen for dancing "impudently and filthily all the day long upon the \n\n|days of the new moon." 52 \n\nFew religious symbols occurred in so many diverse contexts as \nsymbols of the moon. In the runic menological calendar the moon- \nsickle stood for the festival of Harvest Home, which the Scots called \nKirn from Koreion, moon-virgin Kore which Christians renamed \n!the Feast of Our Lady of Mercy. 55 In Gaul the crescent moon stood for \nthe druidic Diana. Crescere meant "to grow," a form of Latin creare, \nto produce, to create. 54 Hence the crescent. Gauls made communion \nbakes in crescent shape. Modern France still makes them, and calls \njrhem croissants, "crescents," colloquially known as "moon-teeth." 55 \n\nThe moon ruled the sexuality of women, and sometimes made \nthem scornful of the male-dominated society\'s notions of hierarchy. \nAn astrological book of 1688 warned: "The double conjunction of \nVenus and the Moon produces extreme lubricity, brings venereal \ndisease, and causes women of quality to become enamored of \nmenservants." 56 \n\nDespite all the church\'s condemnations, rural folk continued to \n\n[rust the Moon-mother in all their most important activities. A \n\nIpopular almanac said: "Kill fat swine for bacon about the full moon. . . . \n\niJhear sheep at the moon\'s increase: fell hand timber from the full to \n\njhe change . . . ; horses and mares must be put together in the increase \n\n|f the moon, for foals got in the wane are not accounted strong . . . ; \n\nfruit should be gathered, and cattle gelded, in the wane of the moon." \n\nMost of all, the moon always governed magic. Melton said in 1620 \n\nmat no sorcerer ever drew a circle of protection without observing the \n\nlime of the moon. 57 \n\n1. Knight, S.L., 99. 2. Hallet, 115. 3. Cumont, A.R.G.R., 19, 69. \n\n4.

They seem to have \nrepresented the Lady of Life and Lord of Death common to most \npagan traditions. \n\n\n\nMordred \n\n"The Killer," who was a son, a uterine nephew, supplanter, and \nOedipal rival of King Arthur, who tried to escape Fate by destroying \nMordred as soon as he was born, and failed. Mordred survived an \nintended Slaughter of the Innocents, grew up, and lived to betray and \nslay his father-king. Like other supplanter-gods he was born of a \nversion of the Triple Goddess, Margawse, the middle one of Arthur\'s \nthree "sisters" who really represented the Virgin, Mother, and \nCrone. See Arthur. \n\n\n\nMorgan Le Fay \n\nCeltic death-goddess: Morgan the Fate, or Fata Morgana, or the \nTriple Morrigan, or "Morgue la Faye." Sometimes she was a Ninefok \nGoddess, the Nine Sisters called Morgen ruling the Fortunate Isles in \\ \nthe far west, where dead heroes went. 2 Sometimes she, or they, became \nmermaids. Morgans or "sea-women" could "draw down to their \npalaces of gold and crystal at the bottom of the sea or of ponds, those \nwho venture imprudently too near the water." 3 \n\nLike Macha, the Crone aspect of the Morrigan, Morgan as \nMother Death cast the destroying curse on every man. Even Arthuri- , \nan romances which presented her as a human being, Arthur\'s sister, \ninconsistently admitted: "Morgan the Goddess is her name, and \nthere is never a man so high and proud but she can humble and tame : \nhim." 4 \n\nSometimes she kindly promised immortality to her favored lovers, \nlike Ogier the Dane, who accompanied her to her paradise. As the \nMorrigan, she stage-managed the contest between Cu Chulainn and a \ngiant named Terrible. She presided over Cu Chulainn\'s killing of his \nspringtime rival, in a tale based on the Celtic legend of Gawain and the \nGreen Knight. 5 \n\nMorgan sat at the head of the table in the Green Knight\'s castle, \npresiding over the death and resurrection of the rival year-gods as \nthey beheaded one another in their proper seasons. Gawain was \nobviously a solar hero, his strength waxing in the morning and \nwaning in the afternoon; he was one of four brothers representing the 1 \nfour solar seasons. The Green Knight was his perpetual antagonist. \n\n\n\n674 \n\n\n\nLike Njord and Frey, Horus and Set, Gwynn ap Nudd and Gwythyr Moras \n\nson of Greidawl, they rose again and killed each other at the turning Morrigan \n\nof the year. Gawain bore Morgan\'s pentacle as a heraldic device on his ^ __ \nblood-red shield. He and his rival seem to have established the \nceremony of knighthood, a symbolic decapitation, which formerly \ntransformed a victim into a god at the year\'s end. 6 \n\nLate romances deprived Morgan of her divinity and made her \nhuman, just as the Great Goddess Mari became a mortal virgin \nMary. Morgan became Arthur\'s sister, yet "a great clerk of necroman- \ncy," a prototypical witch. 7 She received a fictitious husband, King \nUriens of Gore, probably a corrupt form of the classic castrated heaven- \ngod Uranus. Her name was applied to anything magical, miraculous, \nor misleading, as the Fata Morgana. An old word for witches\' spells, \nglamor, came from Glamorgan, the Goddess\'s sacred territory in \nWales. \n\nMorgan\'s mysterious Fortunate Isles continued to appear in Irish \n\nfolklore up to the present time. It was claimed that off the coast of \n\nGalway nine islands rose out of the sea every seven years; but if anyone \n\ntried to reach them by boat, they would vanish. 8 \n\n1. Keightley, 45. 2.

Queens of Ulster governed her shrine, Emain \nMacha, or Macha\'s Emania, land of the moon. 2 She laid the death \ncurse on Cu Chulainn, and haunted battlefields, making magic with \nthe blood of slain men. 3 In the form of a raven she emerged from her \nfairy-mound and perched on a standing-stone, singing of her Myster- \nies: "I have a secret that you shall learn. The grasses wave. The flowers \nglow golden. The goddesses three low like kine. The raven Morrigan \nherself is wild for blood." 4 See Trinity. \n\n1. Rees, 36; Graves, W.G., 409. 2.

This Akkadian \nGreat Mother was \nassociated with many \ntales of heroes float- \ning on rivers in infancy \nfor this was a mythic \nsymbol of birth-waters. \nRome\'s Acca Laren- \ntia drew Romulus and \nRemus from their \nfloating basket on the \nTiber, in the same \nmyth-cycle. 4 Egypt\'s \nversion of her was \nthe "pharaoh\'s daugh- \nter" of the Moses \nmyth, i.e., Hekat the \nMidwife, or Heka- \nAkka. \n\n\n\nSir Flinders Petrie said the name Moses was Egyptian, as in Thut- \nmose, Ahmoses, etc., meaning "unfathered son of a princess." An \nEgyptian model for Moses\'s myth was the demigod Heracles of \nCanopus, drawn from an ark in the Nile bulrushes. When he grew up, \nhe performed great deeds, and finally died on a mountaintop. 1 \n\nThe myth was not only Egyptian. It was applied to many heroes \nand god-kings. King Sargon of Akkad, 2242-2186 B.C., was a virgin- \nborn son of a temple maiden, whose title enitum meant Virgin Bride of \nGod, like the Semitic kadesha. She set Sargon afloat on the river in a \nbasket of rushes. He was rescued by the divine midwife, Akki the Water \nDrawer, now transformed into Aquarius. He passed through the \nsacred king\'s customary adventures: an early threat of destruction from \nthe incumbent monarch, a period of exile in the wilderness, tempta- \ntion by evil spirits, finally elevation to the throne as the spouse of the \nGoddess Ishtar. 2 \n\nThe fatherless hero born of "waters" (Maria) was a universal \nimage of the sacred king, repeated in the myths of Perseus, Horus, \nJason, Oedipus, Trakhan of Gilgit, Joshua son of Nun, and others \nincluding conceptually at least Jesus. Most were based on the \nancient myth of the Goddess Cunti (Kali-the-cosmic-yoni), who gave \nbirth to the sun god and placed him in a basket of rushes on the river \nGanges. The same sun god was reborn in Athens, fathered by Apollo \non the virgin Creusa, and left in a woven basket. 5 \n\nMoses\'s miracles were equally derivative, drawn chiefly from \nEgyptian myths. The drying up of a body of water, to cross dry-shod, \nwas a miracle of Isis, who parted the waters of the river Phaedrus on her \njourney to Byblos. 6 The same tale was told of Bindumati (Kali as \nmother of the bindu or Spark of Life) when she crossed the Ganges. \nMoses\'s extraction of water from a rock was performed long before \nby a guru at Lhasa; his rock is still called "the water of the god\'s \nvessel." 7 Atalanta of Calydon also brought forth water from a rock by \nstriking it with her spear and calling on her Goddess. 8 Mother Rhea \nperformed the same miracle; and she was also the giver of law tablets \non a holy mountain. \n\nThe historical basis of Moses myths seems to have been the \nexpulsion of Jews from Egypt during an outbreak of "pestilence," \npossibly leprosy. The historian Choeremen said the oracles blamed the \ninfection on foreign workers called Children of Israel. The priest \nManetho said in the 3rd century b.c. that alien tribes in northwestern \nEgypt were lepers and unclean. Lysimachus stated that the oracle of \nAmon ordered the alien workers to be collected and driven out of \nEgypt. 9 \n\nTacitus\'s account called the Jews "a race detested by the gods," \nwhose presence in Egypt was responsible for an outbreak of disfigur- \ning disease. The offenders were evicted from Egypt and sent into the \ndesert: \n\n\n\n676 \n\n\n\nThe people, who had been collected after diligent search, finding them- Moses \n\nselves left in a desert, sat for the most part in a stupor of grief, till one of \n\nthe exiles, Moyses by name, warned them not to look for any relief from \n\ngod or man, forsaken as they were of both, but to trust to themselves, ^^^^^^^m \n\ntaking for their heaven-sent leader that man who should first help them to \n\nbe quit of their present misery. They agreed, and in utter ignorance \n\nbegan to advance at random. Nothing, however, distressed them so much \n\nas the scarcity of water, and they had sunk ready to perish in all \n\ndirections over the plain, when a herd of wild asses was seen to retire from \n\ntheir pasture to a rock shaded by trees. Moyses followed them, and, \n\nguided by the appearance of a grassy spot, discovered an abundant spring \n\nof water. This furnished relief. After a continuous journey for six days, \n\non the seventh day they possessed themselves of a country, from which \n\nthey expelled the inhabitants, and in which they founded a city and a \n\ntemple. l0 \n\nJewish history begins with this expulsion from Egypt. Every- \nthing previous to this in the Bible was syncretic mythology gathered \nfrom non-Jewish sources. 11 Moses\'s encounter with the god of \npinai the Chaldean moon-god Sin shows that the Jews tried to settle \nn this god\'s territory, the Cainite-Midianite mining community on \nhe Sinai peninsula. \n\nThe whole peninsula was the Land of Sinim, i.e., "Land of the \nVloon." Its god Sin was a consort of Mother Inanna, or Nanna, who \ninnually turned the waters of Sumer into blood. Sin dwelt in a holy \nnountain, which Moses climbed, and Moses reported that he was the \name as the god of Abraham, though Abraham didn\'t know him by the \name name (Exodus 6:3). In very ancient documents, the name of \nAbraham himself appeared as a synonym for Ab-Sin, "Moon-father." 12 \n\nThe "God of Abraham" whose name meant Father Brahm \nntroduced himself to Moses as "I Am That I Am," in imitation of \nle Brahmanic Tat sat, "I Am That that Is." 1? (See Tetragramma- \non.) The god also commanded, "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, \nar the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5). This \n/as an ancient Hindu custom. In India it is still proper to go barefoot \ni temple precincts, on the theory that subtle emanations from the holy \nround can enter the body through the feet. Ancient Egyptians and \nloman witches had the same custom. 14 \n\nAnother Brahma-like habit of Moses\'s god was to view a thousand \nears of man as one day in his own sight (Psalms 90:4). This was \nrapied from the "Day of Brahma" made up of a thousand years, or \npmetimes a thousand mahayugas or "great aeons." 15 \n\nThe stone tablets of law supposedly given to Moses were copied \nfom the Canaanite god Baal-Berith, "God of the Covenant." Their \n[en Commandments were similar to the commandments of the Bud- \nhist Decalogue. 16 In the ancient world, laws generally came from a \neity on a mountaintop. Zoroaster received the tablets of law from \nLhura Mazda on a mountaintop. 17 An earlier lawgiving mountain- \neity was Mother Rhea of Mount Dicte, or Ninhursag, probably a \n\n\n\n677 \n\n\n\nMoses model for the masculine lawgivers. Moses\'s god provided laws re- \n\nmarkably similar to those handed down from the Babylonian god to \n^^^^^^^^^^^ King Hammurabi. 18 \n\nMoses took over another matriarchal myth in the tale of the \nplagues of Egypt. This came from the third-dynasty reign of Tcheser \' \n(or Joser, whom the Hebrews called Joseph). The Nile flood failed for \nseven years, and Egyptians starved to death by thousands. The \npharaoh sent a desperate message to Mater (Mother), ruler of Nubia, to \nask how the Goddess might be propitiated. Mater\'s reply described \n"the couch of the Nile," a double cavern called Qerti or Khert, the \nunderworld, likened to "two breasts from which all good things \npoured forth." I9 Mater said the trouble was caused by a jealous male \ngod, who wished to be called "father of gods" and to hold the Key of \nthe Nile. As usual, the god\'s practical demands boiled down to gifts and \ntithes for his priesthood. \n\nWhen the story was written down many centuries afterward, in the \nlate Ptolemaic period, priests of Ra pretended their god had ended \nthe drought, by spreading a "red beer" over Egypt\'s fields to distract the \nattention of Mother Hathor, who was killing the people. 20 This \n"beer" was said to be "as human blood." What transformed it into \nblood was a holy substance from the Nile\'s source, called dedi. 21 This \nwas sometimes said to be a salty red earth, like ochre, likened to \nmenstrual blood. Or again, the red color was pomegranate juice, \nanother symbol of menstrual blood. 22 The pomegranate represented the \nvulva in biblical times, and was worshipped as an emblem of the \nGoddess on her holy mount Rimmon ("Pomegranate"). 23 \n\nWhat really turned the Nile into blood was not Moses\'s magic \nwand, but the red silt of flood time, supposed to be the Goddess\'s life- \ngiving uterine blood bathing the land in the substance of life. The \nmythic killing probably referred to hecatombs of firstborn sons, sacri- j \nficed in the attempt to end the drought, their blood spread on the \nfields to encourage the flood by sympathetic magic. See Firstborn. \n\nMoses\'s followers pretended that Yahweh had caused the slaughter \nof Egyptian firstborn sons (Exodus 12:29), while the Israelites were \npermitted to redeem their sons with the blood of lambs (Exodus 13:15). \nHowever, Yahweh had long copied the Egyptian custom of firstborn- \nsacrifice. He said, "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever \nopeneth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of \nbeast; it is mine" (Exodus 13:2). Like early Egyptian gods, Yahweh \nforgave sins only when his altars were soaked in blood: "without \nshedding of blood there is no remission" (Hebrews 9:22). \n\nThe Lord rather unnecessarily told Moses to instruct his people to \nsmear sacrificial blood on their doorposts, a custom that would have \nbeen perfectly familiar to any people living in Egypt where it was done \nat most religious festivals since the earliest times. Again it seems to \nhave originated in the Far East. At New Year sacrifices in China, \ndoorposts were smeared with blood of sacrificial lambs just as in the \n\n\n\n678 \n\n\n\nA \n\n\n\nPassover myth. 24 Upper Nigerian tribes still sacrifice to ancestral ghosts Mot \n\non the threshold of the house and smear the blood on doorposts. 25 Mother Carey \n\nMany laymen are still led to believe that a real Moses wrote the ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nPentateuch (first five books of the Old Testament), even though \nscholars have known for a long time that these books were first written \nin the late post-exilic period by priestly scribes in Jerusalem. 26 Their \npurpose was to create a mythic history for their nation out of customs, \nsayings, and legends mostly borrowed from others. The figure of \nMoses remains mysterious because it was largely a framework of myth \nhung on a non-Jewish name. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 151, 161. 2. Gray, 55. 3. Graves, G.M. 2, 190. \n4.

He was also assimilated to the pre-Christian \nfigure of the Lamb of God, calling himself the sacrificial lamb made \nready with pure wheat to atone for the sins of the people. 1 After each of \nhis annual ceremonial "deaths" he was always resurrected by the \nGoddess, who caused him to be reborn as the new crop, Aleyin.

Potter & Sargent, 71, 117. \n\n\n\n679 \n\n\n\nMotherhood Motherhood \n\n\n\nDuring the early evolution of the human race, motherhood was the \nonly recognized bond of relationship. Like any mammalian family, the \nprimitive human family consisted of mother and offspring. \n\nThe animal family is the product of the maternal instincts and of those \nalone; the mother is the sole centre and bond of it. . . . The male has no \nshare in forming the animal family; he is not an essential member of it; he \nmay join the maternal group, but commonly does not do so. When he \nattaches himself to the animal family his association with it is loose and \nprecarious. . . . Where the female can derive no benefit from associa- \ntion with the male, no such association takes place. Where male \ncooperation is useful, the male seeks out or follows the female, and it is \nthe latter who determines the segregation of the group and selects its \nabode.\' \n\nThe root of civilization was the kinship bond that kept groups \ntogether to evolve mutual cooperation. The bond was maternal because \nno paternal relationships were perceived, or even guessed, by such \nearly groups with their shifting, temporary sexual attachments. "The \nconnection between sexuality and childbearing was unknown to \nprimitive men." 2 \n\nPeople in primitive circumstances still show ignorance of the \nconnection between sexuality and childbearing. Trobriand Islanders \nattributed pregnancy to spirits, not sex. A woman\'s husband might help \ncare for her children, but he thought of them as "the children of my \nwife." The islanders laughed at white men who first tried to tell them \nabout impregnation. Chukchi female shamans said they made their \nchildren by their sacred stones, not by intercourse with men. Australian \naborigines thought women became pregnant by eating some special \nfoods, or by embracing a sacred tree hung with umbilical cords from \nprevious births. Bataks believed no woman could become pregnant \nunless umbilical cords and placentae were buried under her house. 3 \n\nPrimitives not only attributed pregnancy to a variety of causes, but \nalso assigned to it a variety of different durations, showing that they \nwere not sure when it began. 4 Most authorities now agree that not only \nthe uncivilized races today, but certainly all the world\'s people in the \nprehistoric period, knew nothing of man\'s part in the process of \nreproduction. It was believed that only women held the divine power \nto give life. 5 All the most ancient mythologies speak of a Creatress rather \nthan a Creator because living things could be made only by a female, \naccording to primitive beliefs. Men believed themselves unnecessary to 1 \nthe process. 6 \n\nThe most primitive hunting cultures have legends of still earlier \nages, when women possessed all magical arts and men had none. As \nchildbearers and nurturers, women took charge of growing things \ngenerally. They became the producers, storers, and distributors of \nvegetable foodstuffs, hence the owners of the land they used for cultiva- \ntion. They made the earth valuable and equated it with themselves. \n\n\n\n680 \n\n\n\nTheir economic and social power thus evolved the early village commu- Motherhood \n\nnities in matriarchal form. The men saw themselves as almost entirely \n\nsuperfluous, except for the labor they could contribute as hunters or ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ndefenders of the matriarchal group. 7 \n\nThe secret of fatherhood can only have been revealed to men by \nthe women themselves, because women were the keepers of calendri- \ncal records, another traditionally female skill that most men thought \nj beyond their comprehension. Before the advent of monogamous \nmarriage, a late development in human history, there would have been \nno reason or inclination to correlate copulations with births. Even if \n[ the truth were suspected, there were many negative cases to disprove it: \ni some women could copulate frequently and never become pregnant, \nI others could remain "barren" when living with one man but conceive \nI when living with another. Women past menopause or before menar- \nche could take any number of lovers without conceiving, which tended \nto suggest that menstruation was the crucial factor rather than sexual \nactivity. \n\nAs may be found still in many groups of people, motherhood alone \nwas the foundation of clan loyalties. In Assam, the social unit of tribes \njwas maharis, "motherhoods." The Malay family was a sa-mandei, \n"motherhood." Among the Garos and Khasis, mothers headed the \nfamily groups and bequeathed all property in the female line; men could \ninherit nothing. Nearly everywhere, kinship bonds also passed only \nthrough the female line, as in the ancient system deliberately reversed \nSby the Bible\'s "begats," which recognized only male ancestors. Seri \nIndian tribes called themselves Kunkak, "womanhood," or "mother- \niihood." 8 The earliest religious works of art "are figures of the solitary \nGreat Goddess the Paleolithic image of Mother, before there was any \niFather either on earth or in heaven." 9 The idea of fatherhood was \nblien to the religious or social thinking of the earliest civilizations. 10 \n\n"Home and mother" are written over every phase of neolithic agricul- \nture. . . . It was the woman who wielded the digging stick and the hoe; \nshe who tended the garden crops and accomplished those masterpieces of \nselection and cross-fertilization which turned raw wild species into the \nprolific and richly nutritious domestic varieties: it was woman who made \nthe first containers, weaving baskets and coiling the first clay pots. . . . \nIn form, the village, too, is her creation: for whatever else the village might \nbe, it was a collective nest for the care and nurture of the young. Here \nshe lengthened the period of child-care and playful irresponsibility, on \nwhich so much of man \'s higher development depends. House and \nvillage, eventually the town itself, are woman writ large. In Egyptian \nhieroglyphics, "house" or "town" may stand as symbols for "mother," \nas if to confirm the similarity of the individual and the collective nurturing \nfunction. In line with this, the more primitive structures houses, \nrooms, tombs are usually round ones: like the original bowl described in \nGreek myth, which was modeled on Aphrodite\'s breast. " \n\nAncient civilizations show ample evidence of the matriarchal \nmatrix in which they grew. Egyptians traced their descent through \n\n681 \n\n\n\nMotherhood mothers, calling themselves "X, born of the Lady Y," omitting their \n\nfather\'s name. 12 On Egyptian funerary stelae, the mother\'s name was \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ given but the father\'s was omitted. 13 Diodorus said Egyptian queens \nreceived more respect than kings. 14 In the Ramesseum, the queen \nmother was addressed as "mighty mistress of the world." 15 Pharaohs \nruled by matrilineal succession, and styled themselves "Rulers from the \nWomb." 16 The name of the Goddess was always a component part \nof royal names in the earliest dynasties. A pharaoh\'s title was originally \nper aa, Great Gate or Great House, symbol of the cosmic womb. \nRulers of the Egyptians\' Nubian neighbors had an even more mother- \ncentered title: Mater. 17 \n\nEgyptian men were awed by maternal behavior patterns, won- \ndering why women did what they did to maintain the race. Maxims \nwritten about 1500 B.C. said: \n\nThou shalt never forget thy mother and what she has done for thee. \n. . . For she carried thee long beneath her heart as a heavy burden, and \nafter thy months were accomplished she bore thee. Three long years \nshe carried thee upon her shoulder and gave thee her breast to thy mouth, \nand as thy size increased her heart never once allowed her to say, \n"Why should I do this?" > 8 \n\nEgyptian scriptures emphasized the honor due "thy mother, \nwho bore thee with much suffering. She placed thee in the Chamber of \nInstruction that thou mightest acquire instruction in books. She was \nunremitting in her care for thee, and had loaves and beer for thee in her \nhouse. When thou art grown . . . cast thine eyes upon her that gave \nthee birth and provided all good things for thee, thy mother. Let her \nnever reproach thee." 19 \n\nAn Ethiopian woman expressed to Frobenius the basic psychologi- \ncal attitude of primitive mothers: \n\nHow can a man know what a woman \'s life is? . . . The man spends a night \nby a woman and goes away. His life and body are always the same. The \nwoman conceives. As a mother she is another person from the woman \nwithout child. She carries the fruit of the night nine months long in her \nbody. Something grows. Something grows into her life that never again \ndeparts from it. She is a mother. She is and remains a mother even \nthough her child die, though all her children die. For at one time she \ncarried the child under her heart. And it does not go out of her heart \never again. Not even when it is dead. All this the man does not know; he \nknows nothing. He does not know the difference before love and after \nlove, before motherhood and after motherhood. He can know nothing. \nOnly a woman can know that and speak of that. That is why we won \'t \nbe told what to do by our husbands. 20 \n\nIn Old Iranian, the head of a clan or family was the hana, \n"grandmother." Among the Medes, genealogies were based on the \nfemale line. In Babylon, the ideogram for "mother" combined the \nelements of "house" and "deity," like the Hindu grhadevata or "house- \ngoddess." The female sex received precedence in all forms of \n\n\n\n682 \n\n\n\naddress. The descending order of beings began with "Goddess and Motherhood \n\ngods, women and men." 21 By Babylonian law, "any sin against the \n\nmother, any repudiation against the mother was punished by banish- ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nment from the community." The Lycians too kept track of female \n\nancestors only. Heraclides Ponticus said of them, "From of old they \n\nhave been ruled by the women." 22 Phoenicians wrote of recent past \n\nwhen people didn\'t know their fathers, but took the names of their \n\nmothers. 25 \n\nEtruscan tomb inscriptions also disregarded fathers. When married \n\ncouples were buried together, only the wife\'s name was written. Late \nj Roman texts reversed this usage, writing the name of the husband and \n\nomitting that of the wife. 24 But before the founding of Rome, Italy \n\nwas governed by the Sabine matriarchate, when not even kings knew \nI their fathers. Romulus, Ancus Marcus, and Servius Tullius had only \n! mothers. Indeed, fatherhood was not always noticed even in the classical \n\nperiod; Roman plebeians didn\'t know their fathers. When the myth \njof Romulus and his men was written down, it was said Romulus made \nj his followers marry Sabine women, because, as men, they lacked \n\\ sanguis ac genus, the blood of the race. 25 This could come only from \n\nthe female owners of the land. \n\nPatriarchal writers claimed that Romulus named each of the early \n\nRoman curiae (clans) after one of the Sabine women. 26 The story \n[was invented to disguise the fact that these curiae were "motherhoods," \n[bearing the names of maternal ancestresses. 27 The mother of all clans \nDwas Juno Curitis, the Queen of Heaven whom the Romans adopted \nland presented with a new spouse, Jupiter. 28 \n\nAmong barbarian tribes of northern Europe, women were proper- \nIty owners, clan heads, and religious leaders. Roman writers called the \n[(northern nations "lands of women" governed by kvaens (queens). 29 \nHPrehistoric Irish queens were mentioned in old writings, but their \n\'spouses were left nameless. The Lombards claimed their ancestors \n[descended from a primal virgin mother, Gambara, who had no \n|spouse. Mothers, not fathers, gave their names to children in pagan \n[\'Britain and Scandinavia. Old German documents designate persons \ni by their mothers\' names only. 30 \n\nIt was the same in the Far East. Chinese family names are always \n[formed from a sign meaning "woman." The custom is said to date \n[from a past time when people knew their mothers but not their \nbathers. 51 The Man-Tseu of southern China had a system of heredi- \ntary queenship passing through a sacred female clan. 32 Chinese writings \n\ncall Tibet "the land of women" and Japan "the land of queens." \nJapanese imperial families traced their descent from the supreme sun \ni goddess, Omikami Amaterasu, mother of the world. Japanese legend- \nlary "chiefs" of ancestral tribes were usually women. 33 \n\nThe Chinese said the first man to understand fatherhood and \n[institute monogamous marriage was Fu-Hi who, however, had no \nMather but only a mother. 34 The same first discoverer of paternity in \n\n\n\n683 \n\n\n\nMotherhood Greek myth was Cecrops, a high priest of Athene and one of her \n\nserpent-consorts. 55 Athene however was a name of the Aegean Great \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ ^ Goddess and Universal Mother, who ruled alone and supreme \n\nduring the Bronze Age. 56 In the whole Aegean area, religious rites were \nin the hands of priestesses, regarded as emanations or embodiments \nof the Goddess, who was simply woman deified, as the later God was \nman deified. Men didn\'t participate in public worship until a fairly \nlate date, then only as priestesses\' helpers, as the male deity was \nsubordinate to the female. 57 \n\nIn Europe also, the Great Goddess was thought the sole omnipo- \ntent deity. Fatherhood was not incorporated into religious thinking, \nbecause in clan life it was a very frail bond, even if recognized. 58 \nScholars know that "in the beginning the Goddess everywhere \nantedated, or at least was predominant over, the God. It has been \naffirmed that in all countries from the Euphrates to the Adriatic, the \nChief Divinity was at first in woman form." 59 \n\nRecent researches into the history of the family render it in the highest \ndegree improbable that the physical kinship between the god and his \n[sic] worshippers, of which traces are found all over the Semitic area, was \noriginally conceived as fatherhood. It was the mother\'s, not the father\'s \nblood which formed the original bond of kinship among the Semites as \namong other early people and in this stage of society, if the tribal deity \nwas thought of as the parent of the stock, a goddess, not a god, would \nnecessarily have been the object of worship. * \n\nModern male scholars often tried to conceal or deny the \nevidence of the ancient matriarchate. Whenever possible, some auto- \nmatically converted references to the Great Mother into the word \n"God," as was done in translating the Bible. Even so responsible a \nscholar as Cumont, translating Apuleius\'s description of the Syrian \nGoddess as omnipotens et omniparens, "all-powerful and all-produc- \ning," glossed the description as a "conception of the absolute, \nunlimited authority of God [sic] over the earth." 41 \n\nFrankfort said the Goddess was supreme in Mesopotamia \n"because the source of all life is seen in the female." Saggs said she \nwas "the central figure in Neolithic religion." 42 In Egypt, she was "the I \nBeing eternal and infinite, the creative and ruling power of heaven, \nearth, and the underworld, and of every creature and thing in them. . . .1 \nMother-goddess, lady of heaven, queen of the gods . . . who raised up \nTern in primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and \nwho created that which exists . . . the greatest power on earth, who \ncommandest all that is in the universe, and who preservest all the gods \n\n... the God-mother, giver of life All that has been, that is, and that \n\nwill be." 45 \n\nBesides creating the world and everything in it, the Goddess \ncreated the civilized arts: agriculture, building, weaving, potting, \nwriting, poetry, music, the graphic arts, calendars, and mathematics. \nThese seem to have developed mostly in the hands of women as \n\n\n\n684 \n\n\n\noutgrowths of the maternal nest-building, communication, and play Motherhood \n\nbehavior. "Woman was the creator of the primordial elements of \n\ncivilization [A]ll the richer perceptions and interpretations that color ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe actualities of life, all art, all poetic sentiment, are irradiations of ^^^^^^^^ \n\nthose extra-individualistic, racial interests which are represented by the \n\nreproductive instincts, and are the dominant interests of the female. \n\nThey have their source in the race-regarding feminine impulses." 44 \nHindu scriptures say the Goddess invented alphabets, pictographs, \n\nmandalas and other magical signs, hence her title of Samjna (sign, \n\nname, image). The Brahmavaivarta Purana says under another of her \n[titles, Savitri, the Goddess gave birth to the Vedas, the rhythms of the \n\nRagas, day and night, the year, the month, the seasons, the inch, the \n\nsecond, and all other units of measurement; also logic, grammar, the \n[days of the week, Time, Death, Nourishment, Memory, Victory, \ni religious rituals, the trinity of aeons, and all the gods. 45 \n\nAs Great Mother Kali Ma, she wore on her necklace of skulls the \n; sacred Sanskrit letters, which she invented, and invested with such \n\nmagic power that she could create things simply by pronouncing their \nnames in this language. 46 The notion led to the Neoplatonic, and \nlater Christian, concept of the Creative Word or Logos. \n\nSanskrit matra, like the Greek meter, meant both "mother" and \n"measurement." Mathematics is, by derivation, "mother-wisdom." \nRoot words for motherhood produced many words for calculation: \nmetric, mensuration, mete, mens, mark, mentality; geo-metry, tri- \ngono-metry, hydro-metry, etc. Women did temporal and spatial \ncalculations for so long that, according to the Vayu Purana, men \nonce thought women were able to give birth because they had superior \nskill in measuring and figuring. Men imagined that if they could \nmaster these feminine skills, they could give birth, too. "Male ances- \ntors" told one another that if they could only learn to measure the \nearth, they would "happily create progeny." 47 \n\nIn the Middle East also, numbers and letters were inventions of \nthe Goddess and the special concern of her priestesses. Ashurbanipal \nproudly declared that he was the first Babylonian king to learn "the \nnoble art of tablet- writing," which belonged to the special scribes \ncalled maryanu.** A similar Egyptian word for a scribe was Maryen or \nMahir, "great one" or "mother." 49 No one was permitted to enter \nthe Holy of Holies in Babylon\'s municipal temple except women who \nhad given birth; thus it seems likely that the maryanu were originally \nmothers, dedicated to the Semitic Goddess Mari-Anna, otherwise \nknown as Ishtar. 50 Among the Hittites, priestesses known as Elderly \nWomen taught the art of writing, kept records, advised kings, and \npracticed medicine. 51 The Triple Goddess of Fate was incarnate in \nthree Guises or "writers," corresponding to the Germanic Fates called \nDie Schreiberinnen, the Writing- Women, and the Roman mother of \ndestiny Fata Scribunda, "the Fate who writes." 52 \n\nIn pre-Hellenic Greece the alphabet was attributed to the original \n\n\n\n685 \n\n\n\nMotherhood three Muses, who were identical with the Fates or Graeae, epony- \n\nmous mothers of Greek tribes. The Latin alphabet was created by the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ archaic Goddess Carmenta, mother of carmens or "charms." Or, \n\naccording to Isidore of Seville, the alphabet was created by the Moon- i \ngoddess Io under her Egyptian name of Isis. 5J \n\nEgyptians revered the Goddess as measurer of time, mistress of \nthe house of books, mistress of the house of architects. 54 As foundress of \nthe science of architecture she was named Seshat, "Lady of the \nBuilder\'s Measure." She built "the abode of a king in the next world," a \npyramid. She also created the Golden Calf, Horus, familiar in the \nBible as the idol worshipped by Aaron and the Israelites. 55 \n\nAncient beliefs linking motherhood with superior intelligence, \nreasoning power, and magical knowledge made it hard for men to \noppose the matriarchate, even when they discovered paternity and \npersonified it in gods. Fathers\' claim to children\'s respect seemed \nrelatively trivial by comparison with the mothers\' gestation, birth-giving, \nnursing, supporting, and daily teaching. The Book of Maccabees said \na mother\'s sympathy with her children is deeper than a father\'s. 56 The \nMahanirvanatantra said, "Mother is superior to father on account of \nher bearing and also nourishing the child." 57 Menander wrote, "A \nmother loves her child more than a father does." 58 Therefore the \nchild is more hers than his; as the old Irish proverb put it, "To every \ncow belongs her calf." 59 The Laws of Manu stated that "A spiritual \nteacher exceeds a worldly teacher ten times, a father exceeds a spiritual \nteacher one hundred times, but a mother exceeds one thousand times \na father\'s claim to honor on the part of a child and as its educator." 60 \n\nThere may have been a real biological advantage underlying \nancient views of the female\'s superior intelligence. As mothers or \npotential mothers, female mammals have more need of naturally \nresponsive alertness than males. "Girls\' more mature skills enable \nthem to attend to stimuli, especially from other people, more swiftly and \naccurately than boys. Girls are better at analyzing and anticipating \nenvironmental demands; in addition, they have greater verbal facility. \n. . . The perceptual, cognitive, and verbal skills which for unknown \nreasons are more characteristic of girls enable them to analyze and \nanticipate adult demands." 61 As a modern woman said, "After the birth < \nof children that enormous thing you do everything else seems \nkind of a breeze. But so many of us lock the doors of the mind. We nev- \ner bother to penetrate below the surface of that bottomless sea of \nresources that may be nature\'s gift to women." 62 \n\nFor a long time men feared to oppose women because they were \nconvinced women were more closely allied with the forces of nature. \nWest African tribesmen testified that "women were more powerful than \nmen, for to them alone the mysteries of the gods and of secret things \nwere known." Women founded the magical Egbo society, but after \nmen learned the secret rites, they kept women from participating any \nmore. In Queensland also, once men learned magic, they forbade \n\n\n\n686 \n\n\n\nwomen to practice, on the ground that women had too much natural Motherhood \n\naptitude for it. 63 \n\nIn northern Europe, the Vanir or Elder Gods, led by Mother ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nEarth and the Goddess Freya, were overthrown by new patriarchal \ndeities from Asia, the Aesir led by Father Odin. In the Aegean, \nfollowers of Father Zeus fought the pre-Hellenic worshippers of \nMother Rhea or Hera. In Babylon, worshippers of Marduk rebelled \nagainst the primal mother Tiamat, whose own son killed her to take \nDver her world-creating function. In Mexico, the legendary leader of the \n\\ztecs overthrew his sister Malinalxochitl, former ruler of men and \nDeasts, afterward described as "a bad witch." 64 \n\nIn Australia, the Goddess named Marm (Mother) was diabolized \n>y men who resented the advantages she bestowed on women. She \nnade women in her own image, and gave them "magic fruit" (off- \nspring) that she denied to men. 65 In Malekula, men frankly admitted \n:hat their religious rites were stolen from the women, who invented \n[hem but ceased to practice them. 66 Tierra del Fuegan men said \nvomen used to rule the world by witchcraft, and all religious mysteries \npelonged to their Goddess, the moon. 67 Men adopted the cult of the \n^un god, and under his leadership they murdered all the adult women of \nthe tribe, leaving only immature girls not yet initiated. 68 \n\nA transparently mendacious Iatmul legend said women invented \nacred objects and secrets of magic, then "gave" these things to men, \nand "asked" the men to murder them so no woman would have the \nsecrets any more. 69 Many similar examples show that the defeat of \nhe matriarchate was mythologized as a violent attack of men upon \nvomen. Such myths of leadership forcibly wrested from women \n>ccur throughout the world and cannot be overlooked. 70 As Engels \nloted, "The overthrow of mother-right was the world-historical \nlownfall of the female sex." 71 \n\nIn some ways, it may have meant the downfall of all humanity \nrom a basically peaceful social order to a hierarchical structure \nstablished and maintained by aggression. Patriarchal societies insisted \nm pecking orders; matriarchal ones tended to be more egalitarian. 72 \nNeolithic village cultures with their matriarchal family-based govern- \nnents were cooperative, unwarlike, and nonviolent. Their lack of \nlestructiveness has been attributed to the life-loving spirit of affirmation \nhat scholars find at the core of most matriarchal societies. 73 \n\nThe same spirit of affirmation has been found in matriarchal or \niemi-matriarchal societies of the recent past. American Indians who \nvorshipped the female principle, and were ruled by tribal chiefs elected \n>y the real leaders, called Female Governesses, surprised Christian \nnissionaries with behavior more "Christian" than that of white men. A \nnissionary said, "What is extremely surprising in men whose external \nippearance is wholly barbarous, is to see them treat one another with a \njentleness and consideration which one does not find among com- \nnon people in the most civilized countries." Indian women were \n\n\n\n687 \n\n\n\nMotherhood known as the Life of the Nation, and Mistresses of the Soil. 74 In \n\nanswer to a white questioner who couldn\'t understand the Indian \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^ reverence for women, one Indian man said, "Of course the men \nfollow the wishes of the women; they are our mothers." 75 \n\nEven aggressive savages like the Dobu Islanders regarded mother- \nhood as the only possible antidote to warfare. Mutual trust was \nmaintained exclusively among members of a matrilineal kinship group \nknown as "mother\'s milk." 76 Societies where women set the stan- \ndards of behavior and morality were found generally kinder than \nmale-dominated societies. Children grew up without harsh punish- \nments, expecting kindness from others as a matter of course and \nconsequently developing into nonhostile, nonviolent adults. Envy, \ngreed, and exploitiveness were minimal; depression almost unknown; \ncrime almost unheard-of. People were generally good-humored, \ntrustful, and confident. Women were treated as the equals of men. \nAttitudes toward sexuality tended to be positive and permissive. \nPeople seemed to feel sure Mother Nature would provide for their \nneeds, even in cases where a harsh environment demanded hard \nwork for the sake of survival. 77 \n\nSocieties dominated by men tended to introduce cruel punish- \nments, hostility toward the young, formalized rivalry, and sadistic \nelements replacing easy, affectionate sexuality. Some of this may have \nbeen biologically based. Among animals, females care for the young, \nmales fight for mates, and care only for themselves. The primitive \nhuman female "nourished, reared and protected the more feeble \nthan herself, while her mate, a terrible savage, knew only how to pursue \nand kill." 78 \n\nWhen new-born humanity was learning to stand upright, it depended \nmuch on its mother and stood close to her protecting side. Then \nwomen were goddesses, they conducted divine worship, women \'s voice I \nwas heard in council, she was loved and revered and genealogies were \nreckoned through her. What broke into this feminine Elysium and robbed \nit of liberty and happiness? The male of the species. As the race grew \nolder, rationality flourished at the expense of moral sense. . . . Man, \nunmindful of the mother\'s contributions to racial uplift and welfare, \nthought only of bending every energy and forcing tribute from everything^ \nand every one who could elevate himself and give him dominating \npower. . . . There\'s no more reason for not killing humans who oppose \nyou than for sparing the lives of mosquitoes, in the mind of a man \nwhose self-seeking emotions are permitted to run rampant. And the \naverage "normal" male\'s personality balance tends definitely in the \nsame direction. \n\nBachofen said, "The idea of motherhood produces a sense of \nuniversal fraternity among all men, which dies with the development of ^ \npaternity." Ancient societies believed that those related by mother- \nblood shared a common soul, so no member of the group could hurt \nanother without doing injury to himself. Egyptians and other folk \n\n\n\n688 \n\n\n\ncarefully distinguished between children of the same mother and Motherhood \n\nchildren of the same father; the former were the "real" siblings, \n\nconstrained to care for each other as for their own selves. As Telema- \n\nchus remarked, a person must be told who his father is; the mother is ^^^^^^^^" \n\nthe parent every child knows "of himself." 80 \n\nPsychologists agree that the images of Mother and Father affect \n:he psyche in different ways. Feelings of connectedness are more closely \nassociated with the mother; feelings of dissociation or alienation with \nthe father. In spiritual terms, outer and inner worlds of nature and the \nelf were not separated under a matriarchal order, whereas patriarchy \ninsisted on their absolute severance. 81 \n\nPast societies dreaded even a temporary loss of the mother image. \n\\puleius spoke of the period when the Goddess departed from the \nvorld for her season of self-renewal: "There has been no pleasure, no \noy, no merriment anywhere, but all things lie in rude unkempt \nleglect; wedlock and true friendship and parents\' love for their children \nlave vanished from the earth; there is one vast disorder, one hateful \noathing and foul disregard of all the bonds of love." 82 When the \n[goddess permanently disappeared from theological imagery, the \nense of alienation became universal: \n\nThe earlier, neolithic order was of the female above the male, the cosmic \nmother above the father . . . with the progressive devaluation of the \nmother-goddess in favor of the father, which everywhere accompanied the \nmaturation of the dynastic state and patriarchy. . . . A sense of essential \nseparation from the supreme value symbol became in time the characteris- \ntic religious sentiment of the entire Near East. 83 \n\nG. R. Taylor\'s classification of "matrist" and "patrist" societies \nshowed guilt, negativism, and fear in the latter, as opposed to a more \n:onfident outlook in the former. Matrist societies were typified by: ( 1 ) \n>ermissive attitude toward sex; (2) freedom for women; (3) high \neminine status; (4) welfare more valued than chastity; (5) democratic \nlitical principles; (6) progressive views; (7) spontaneity, exhibition; (8) \nex differences minimized; (9) hedonism, pleasure welcomed; (10) \nnother worship. Patrist societies displayed opposite tendencies: (1) \nestrictive attitude toward sex; (2) restriction of women; (3) women \neen as inferior, sinful; (4) chastity more valued than welfare; (5) \nluthoritarian politics; (6) conservative, against innovation; (7) inhibi- \nion, fear of spontaneity; (8) sex differences maximized, e.g. in dress; (9) \near of pleasure, ascetic self-denial; (10) father worship. 84 \n\nWorshippers of the Great Mother celebrated rites of "love," \nncluding sexual love, which was often taken as a symbol for all loves, \njxpressed in gestures and acts similar to those of mother-child behavior: \ncuddling, breast-sucking, and so on. Conversely, votaries of the \nr ather were ordered to "fear" him (Deuteronomy 6:13). St. Paul \neclared that those who had no fear of God were automatically \ninners (Romans 3:18). Christianity gave its followers much to fear, \nncluding one of the most sadistic hells ever devised by the human \n\n\n\n689 \n\n\n\nMotherhood imagination, and an implacable God who consigned "most" human \n\nbeings to that hell forever, according to his theologians (see Hell). \n\n^^^^^^^ m ^^^ m But the primitive Mother gave comfort and reassurance. Eskimo sha- \nmans still call her the soul of the universe, never seen, but her voice \ncan be heard: "a gentle voice, like a woman, a voice so fine and gentle \nthat even children cannot become afraid. What it says is \'Be not \nafraid of the universe.\' " 85 \n\nMontagu says the mother image is still used to alleviate terror. \n"When the male\'s defenses are down, when he is in extremis, when \nhe is dying, his last, like his first word, is likely to be \'mother,\' in a \nresurgence of his feeling for the mother he has never repudiated, but \nfrom whom he had been forced, at the overt level, to disengage \nhimself." 86 Eugene O\'Neill expressed the secret longing in a dramat- \nic speech: \n\nThe mistake began when God was created in a male image. . . . That \nmakes life so perverted, and death so unnatural. We should have \nimagined life as created in the birth-pain of God the Mother. Then we \nwould understand why we, Her children, have inherited pain, for we \nwould know that our life\'s rhythm beats from Her great heart, torn with \nthe agony of love and birth. And we would feel that death meant \nreunion with Her, a passing back into her substance, blood of Her blood \nagain, peace of Her peace! Now wouldn \'t that be more logical and \nsatisfying than having God a male whose chest thunders with egotism and \\ \nis too hard for tired heads and thoroughly comfortless? 87 \n\nThe Kagaba Indians expressed the same sentiments in a less \nsophisticated but equally forceful song describing their Goddess: \n\nThe Mother of Songs, the mother of our whole seed, bore us in the \nbeginning. She is the mother of all races of men and the mother of all \ntribes. She is the mother of thunder, the mother of the rivers, the mother \nof trees and of all kinds of things. She is the mother of songs and \ndances. She is the mother of the older brother stones. She is the mother of \nthe grain and the mother of all things. . . . She is the mother of the \ndance paraphernalia and of all temples, and the only mother we have. She \nis the mother of the animals, the only one, and the mother of the Milky \nWay. It was the mother herself who began to baptize. She gave us the \nlimestone coca dish. She is the mother of the rain, the only one we \nhave. She alone is the mother of things, she alone. And the mother has \nleft a memory in all the temples. With her sons, the saviors, she left \nsongs and dances as a reminder. 88 \n\nPsychologists often regard the universal myth of the Golden \nAge as a symbol of childhood. Yet when Plato wrote of the Golden \nAge, he apparently took some details from matriarchal societies \nfamiliar to the Greeks as either contemporary or belonging to the recent \npast. He said there was "no wildness nor eating of each other, nor any \nwar, nor revolt amongst them. . . . There were no governments nor \n\n\n\n690 \n\n\n\nwrate possessions of women and children. For all men rose again Motherhood \n\nim the earth remembering nothing of their past. And such things as \n\nvate property and families did not exist." 89 This was regarded as a ^^^^^^^^^ \n\nment of Plato\'s imagination until research discovered the pre-urban \n\nmmunity of the Neolithic cultivator: \n\nThere was no ruling class to exploit the villagers, no compulsion to work \nfor a surplus the local community was not allowed to consume, no taste \nfor idle luxury, no jealous claim to private property, no exorbitant desire \nfor power, no institutional war. Though scholars have long contemptu- \nously dismissed the "myth of the Golden Age, " it is their scholarship, \nrather than the myth, that must now be questioned. \n\nSuch a society had indeed come into existence at the end of the last \nIce Age, if not before, when the long process of domestication had \ncome to a head in the establishment of small, stable communities with an \nabundant and varied food supply: communities whose capacity to \nproduce a surplus ofstorable grain gave security and adequate nurture to \nthe young. The rise in vitality was enhanced by vivid biological \ninsight. 90 \n\nAt Catal Huyuk, in what is now southern Turkey, a matriarchal \nnmunity of the 7th millenium B.C., there was no evidence of \neftainship or rivalry, though there were many priestesses. Children \nre buried in the tombs of their mothers. Art and handicrafts flour- \ned, producing obsidian mirrors, copper and lead jewelry and tools, \nollen textiles, artistically carved wooden vessels. For 1 500 years \nen times as long as the existence of the United States of Ameri- \nthe community seemed free of massacre or war. Though many \nndreds of skeletons have been found, none showed any sign of \nilent death. 91 \n\nMatriarchal Sumeria dominated the Fertile Crescent for 3000 \nirs with virtually no evidence of warfare. 92 Neolithic foundations of \nh peaceful societies have been unearthed at Hassuna, Tell Halaf, \nmarra, and Ubaid where there were no gods. Holy icons showed \nly naked women holding or nursing infants. 93 Patriarchal religions \nidually ousted the ancient matriarchies, chiefly by violence; but \nne scholars have suggested that this revolution was neither satisfac- \ny nor final. The Great Mother, ostensibly overthrown by her sons, \nin ineradicable archetype dwelling somewhere in the psyche of every \nman being born of woman which means, of course, every \nman being. The more emphatically she is denied, the more threaten- \n5 her images appear. 94 Ancient myths were not merely allegorizing \nlen they spoke of the furious wrath of a neglected deity. \n\nEven scholars refrain from noticing the everyday words for ances- \nthat clearly indicated matrilineal descent: "forebears," for \nimple, a short form of "fore-bearers." Ancestry is called extraction, \nd obvious reference to what one came out of; similarly descent is \n\n\n\n691 \n\n\n\nMotherhood the "descending" from the womb. From the beginning, it was materr \n\nspirit that fostered cooperation and togetherness in work or worship. \n\n^^^^^^i The maternal totemic clan was by far the most successful form that \n\nhuman association has assumed it may indeed be said that it has been \nthe only successful one. . . . Political organizations, religious theocracies \nStates, nations, have endeavored in vain to achieve real and complete \nsocial solidarity. They are artificial structures; social humanity has nevei \nsucceeded in adequately replacing the primitive bond to which it owes \nits existence. 9S \n\nMedieval ballads depict a pagan world where mothers were the \nultimate authority in every household. Sons appealed to mothers, not \nfathers, in times of crisis, as the ballad-hero Johnie Cock asked the \nhelp of his mother, and through her, of the Goddess. Christianity \nhowever was devoted to destruction of the Goddess and her temples \n(Acts 19:27). Clement of Alexandria quoted Christ: "I have come to \ndestroy the works of the female." 96 Christ ordered his followers to \nrenounce their families (Luke 14:26) and said to his own mother, \n"Woman, what have I to do with thee?" (John 2:4). Fathers of the \nchurch wrote diatribes against motherhood. 97 Western religion conse- \nquently became an exercise in male-dominated power-seeking. 98 \n\nMany male scholars still try to pretend there never was a \nGoddess, or if there was, she was only a "cult" figure vaguely associab \nwith sexual promiscuity and/or "fertility." It is not recognized that \nreligious feeling for the Mother was, if anything, much deeper and \nmore passionate than feelings for a divine patriarch. Deities of both \nsexes are styled "gods." Egyptian sacred art showing divine persons w \nobvious dangling breasts, is described as a picture of "gods." 99 \nScholars carefully avoid quoting ancient texts that say the Primordial \nBeing was a Creatress, not a Creator. Though she was the central \nunifying concept of ancient civilizations, the Great Mother isn\'t men- \ntioned in ancient-history texts. Scholars\' violent denial of the \nevidence for the prehistoric matriarchate causes one to suspect that thi \nprejudices often blind their eyes, as if a patriarchal culture prevents its \nmembers from comprehending any foreign viewpoint. 100 \n\nFreud\'s ignorance of feminine values left him incapable of undei \nstanding humanity\'s most basic bonds. He gave sexuality a primary \nsignificance that probably should have been relegated to the mother- \nchild bond instead. Freud admitted that thirty years of practice never \ntaught him what women really want because, of course, he had \nalready convinced himself that what every woman wanted was a \npenis. 101 He even went so far as to imagine that a mother loved her \nchild only because it was, for her, a penis-substitute. \n\nThe reason for Freud\'s failure of insight here should by now be plain: in \nhis analysis of the development of the self, he left out of account the \n\n\n\n692 \n\n\n\n\n\n\npositive influence of the other member of the family, the mother. Motherhood \n\nOveremphasizing, if anything, the rule of the father, the/ovean, \n\npower-seeking, repressive, organizing element in the personality, he \n\nplayed down the function of the mother, with her life-bestowing gifts, ^^^^^^ammm^^m \n\nher relaxing and yielding attitudes, her life-transmitting and life-nurturing \n\nfunctions: the mother\'s sympathy and responsiveness, her giving of the \n\nbreast to her infant, her special effort to establish an I-and-thou intimacy \n\nthrough language, her endless ways of expressing love. W2 \n\nFreudian phallocentrism added to Christian devaluation of the \nfemale tended to perpetuate the common pattern of troubled families, \nas described by a social worker: "There\'s always a husband who\'s \nwitholding his emotional support and a wife who\'s unhappy, whose \neeling of personal worth has been damaged." 10? Mumford points \naut that devaluation of motherhood leaves children of both sexes cut off \nrom a vital experience, the essential basis of all future commitments \nto cooperative functioning in the social context. "In repressing the \nmothering and nurturing impulses, in the personality, the scientist has \nilso lost the normal parental concern for the future life it cherishes. One \nlardly knows whether to characterize this attitude as innocence or \natalism; it certainly indicates a failure to reach maturity." 104 \n\nGilder theorizes that few men can attain psychological maturity at \nill without a vital connection with the sense of futurity through \nntimate association with a woman. She has, "as part of her very \nxuality, a sense of the future: a sense of evolution and growth, a \nlotion of deferring pleasures for future gains, a sense of the phases and \nleasons of life, a devotion to the value of the individual human being. \nThese sentiments are the very source of human morality." 105 Indeed \nhese are precisely the sentiments embodied in matriarchal religions\' \ncyclic, future-oriented view of life. Such religions were free of the \nleurotic quest for indefinable "meaning" in life, since they never \nissumed that life would be required to justify itself. They were also \njenerally free of the anxiety, guilt, and sense of sin imposed by \n>atriarchal religions, evolved by males made insecure from earliest \nhildhood by a social order based on male intimidation and \nlominance. \n\nMight-is-right morality was typical of the linear, hierarchical mas- \nculine theology. Feminine morality seems to have been both more \niubtle and more affirmative, fostering the same spirit of close coopera- \nion that enabled humanity to become civilized in the first place. \n\nDespite the basic male need to take part in feminine values, the \n>atriarchal society seems to be organized the other way: women are \nbreed to attain a sense of personal worth by taking part in masculine \nvalues. Instead of aspiring happily to the worthy estate of mother- \nlood, many women are taught to think it unworthy while they are still \nn the "bosom" of the patriarchal family: \n\n\n\n693 \n\n\n\nMotherhood The upwardly mobile career of every go-getting woman seems to have \n\nbeen her father\'s gift to her. As a sop to his male guilt, Daddy may have \n\ngoaded daughter to achievements he willfully denied his wife; or as a sop \n\nto his male vanity, he may have engendered in her such hurtful feelings \nof female worthlessness that only the adoption of a male-style existence \ncould appease. But always, it seems, daughter has been vicariously \nwounded by damage the maternal ego suffered at paternal hands. She may \nfeel compassion for her mother\'s plight, or contempt that "Mama let \nPapa get away with it, " or a mixture of both emotions, but she invariably \ngrows up with an almost pathologic horror of "living out Mom \'s life all \nover again." 106 \n\nBriffault and other scholars believed devaluation of the maternal \nrole inflicted injury on males as well as females: "Men have much more \nof the \'patriarchal theory\' to unlearn. Women have to learn that all \nracial ideals that are worth while are ultimately identical with their own \nelemental instincts, and are the outcome of them. . . . The compro- \nmises that govern the relations between the sexes are those that \ncondition all true human values. ... It is, as of old, the part of the \nVestal Mothers to tend the Sacred Fires. Upon women falls the task not \nonly of throwing off their economic dependence, but of rescuing \nfrom the like thraldom the deepest realities of which they were the first \nmothers." 107 \n\nEven Buddha reached back to basic maternal imagery in his \nDiscourse on Universal Love: "As a mother, even at the risk of her \nown life, protects and loves her child, her only child, so let a man \ncultivate love without measure toward the whole world, above, \nbelow, and around, unstinted, unmixed with any feeling of differing or \nopposing interests. . . . This state of mind is the best in the world." 108 \nBut no man could achieve it without Motherhood as a model. \n\nI. Briffault 1,191. 2. Neumann, A.C.U., 1 1. 3. Frazer, G.B., 45-46, 138. \n\n4.

This was "going a-mothering." Herrick mentioned the custom \nn his canzonet to the nymph Dianeme, probably Diana of Nemi. \nThe simnel was a manikin, Gingerbread Man, similitude, or Host: a god \neremonially eaten. 1 \n\n1. Brewster, 144. \n\n\n\nMountain \n\n\'erhaps more than any other natural objects, mountains most often \nepresented the Great Mother. In every land the mountains were \ndentified with breasts, belly, or mons veneris of the Earth, as well as \nhe paradise where gods live. \n\nChomo-Lung-Ma, "Goddess-Mother of the Universe," is the \nworld\'s highest mountain, known in the west, typically, by the name \n)f a man: Mount Everest. Nearby rises Annapurna, "Great Breast Full \n>f Nourishment." 1 There is also Nanda Devi, "Blessed Goddess," \nnother of the river-goddess Ganga (Ganges). These mountains are \nome of the Primal Mothers called Himalaya, "Mountains of Heav- \n:n," which gave rise to the Germanic Himmel, "heaven." 2 \n\nNorthern Europeans called the home of the gods Himinbjorg, \nleaven-Mountain. 3 The gods lived on the "lap" of the Great \nMother. "This notion of a mountainous situation of the home of the \n;ods is one shared by other Indo-European races such as the Greeks \nvho settled their pantheon on Mount Olympus; it is surely behind the \nwalmist\'s \'I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh \nny help.\'" 4 \n\nSnow-covered, breast-shaped mountains were considered the \nource of "help" (or food) from the benevolent Goddess whose white \nnilk was really water: glacier-fed streams whose waters were often white \nvith suspended rock dust. The Mountain Mother was both a source \n)f life-giving waters, and a Queen of Heaven. One of the oldest titles of \n\n\n\n695 \n\n\n\nMountain \n\n\n\nDravidian Referring \nto the cultures of the \nDravidian language \ngroup in southern and \ncentral India, now \nranging from highly \ncivilized people to \npreliterate forest primi- \ntives. Dravidian \nlanguages were rooted \nin pre-Aryan Indus \nValley civilization, the \nearliest known in \nIndia. \n\n\n\nthe Hindu triple Goddess Parvati-Kali-Uma was Daughter of Heaven j \n(Himalaya). 5 According to the Greeks, the Goddess formerly ruled not I \nonly Mount Olympus, home of the classic gods, but all mountains; \nhence her title Panorma, "Universal Mountain Mother." 6 \n\nOne of the archaic Goddesses was Niobe, "Snowy One," identi- \\ \nfied with Mount Sipylus, where a water-streaming crag still bears the \ncarved image of a Hittite mother goddess. 7 Mountainous breasts rise in i \nCounty Kerry, Ireland, as double peaks called the Paps of Anu that \nis, the ancestral Goddess Anu, or Danu, mother of the Tuatha De \nDanann. 8 Samoyed shamans believe they must experience a vision of \nclimbing a magic mountain, where they will meet the Lady of Waters. \nShe is a naked Goddess who accepts the shaman by allowing him to \nfeed at her breast, saying, "You are my child; that is why I let you suckle \nat my breast." 9 \n\nSumero-Babylonian texts spoke of the Mother-mountain where \nthe sun god was daily born and nightly swallowed up. This was \nMashu, "Twin Peaks," as high as the walls of heaven, dwelling in the \nwestern garden of paradise by the shores of Ocean. 10 The twin peaks \nwere breasts nourishing heaven, and the mountain had another set of 3 \n"paps" reaching downward to nourish the underworld, as if it were \nthe two-faced Goddess of life and death. The way into the land of death \nwas into the Mother-mountain\'s body, via the Road of the Chariot, \nor Road of No Return. 1 \' \n\nThere was a curious resemblance between Mashu of the Sumeri- \nans and Macchu Picchu of the Peruvian Incas, another twin-peaked \nholy mountain where the sun rose and set, tended by priestesses. There \nas in distant Sumeria, the common name of the Goddess was \nMama. 12 \n\nThe Hindu pantheon was settled on Mount Meru, or Sumeru, the \n"Good Mountain" located in the north, pointing to an archaic \nconnection between India and Sumeria. 13 The Chinese located their 1 \nMount of Paradise in the same general vicinity as Sumeria, in the \nwest. It produced the usual four rivers and was surrounded by "red \nwater" like the River of Blood that surrounded ancient Fairylands. 14 \nSee Menstrual Blood. \n\nIranians said the Lofty Mountain-Mother stood at the center of trK \nearth. She was called High Haraiti. At her summit was the Navel of \nWaters, "for the fountain of all waters springs there, guarded by a \nmajestic and beneficent Goddess." The Vedas say Yama, Lord of \nDeath, sits in the midst of the celestial ocean in her highest heaven, oni \nthe Navel of Waters, where "matter first took form." 15 The Japanese \ncombined him with the Mountain-Mother Fuji the Ancestress, and the \nmagic mountain came to be called Fujiyama. 16 \n\nA very old Dravidian form of the mountain-Mother was Hariti, \nwho nursed five hundred supernatural beings at once. 17 The gods she I \n\n\n\n696 \n\n\n\nupported on her lap recall archetypal images of the infant enthroned on Mountain \n\nhe mother\'s body, which is simultaneously "earth" and "paradise." \n\ndyths hold many indications of the child-parent relationship between ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhe god and his feminine support. One of the emblems of Isis was \n\nhe Mu\'at, "foundation of the throne," meaning hers was the lap the \n\niharaoh and his divine alter ego sat on, on earth as well as in heaven. \n\nThe Persian sun god Ahura Mazda lived in a glowing palace on \nhe summit of Mount Hara, a derivative of Hariti. 18 In Hebrew, hara \ntieant both "mountain" and "pregnant belly." 19 In Latin the word \nescribed the official diviners called haruspices, those who gaze into \n!ie belly that is, entrail-readers. 20 \n\nThe idea of the Mount of Paradise as the Goddess\'s belly or vulva \npd to the widespread belief that life-giving rivers of blood emanated \nrom it, the "four rivers of paradise" common to Asiatic traditions, \nientified with real rivers by the Bible with lofty disregard for their \neography (Genesis 2:10-14). One of these rivers was Gihon, the \nlebrew name for the Nile, coming from "the whole land of \nEthiopia." The name was a corruption of Gehenna or Ge-enna, the \nliver of Ge (Gaea), or of Mother Earth. Or again, the Nile was \nupposed to emanate from the Mountain of the Moon (Ruwenzori) \n(eyond Ethiopia. \n\nThis was one of the universal female-symbolic images in mytholo- \ny: the lunar mountain, located in a garden of paradise, containing a \nreat cave or labyrinth, producing the rivers of life. Its genital connota- \non could hardly be overlooked. Arabs called it Jebel Ka-Mar, the \nMother-mountain. Even in medieval European romances it was the \naurce of wisdom; Merlin learned his magic by drinking of its \nmbrosia. Anointed knights of Charlemagne, searching for the same \nDurce, traveled to a great cavern under a Mountain of the Moon at \nle headwaters of the Nile. 21 \n\nEgyptians eventually transferred the mystic source of the Nile \nfom the remote Mountains of the Moon to the handier first cataract \nt Elephantine (modern Jazirat Aswan). This was regarded as the earth\'s \nDni, where the God mated with the Goddess, to produce the annual \nutpouring of the Nile. The genital metaphor of the mountain is still \njggested by the word mons, meaning both a mountain and a female \nenital. 22 \n\nPyramids and ziggurats were artificial mountains built where the \nd was flat, to serve as thrones of the Lord, "high places" for his \ncred marriage to the Goddess, earth-wombs for his regeneration, and \nlrines. Like the Celtic tumulus, a Buddhist reliquary mound or \niipa was also an imitation of the holy mountain, often likened to the \nlother\'s belly. 25 Similar tombs on a larger scale were the Mycenaean \nwhs tombs, covered with tons of earth to make artificial hills. 24 \n\nEastern lamas were interred in domes or pyramids plated with gold \n\n\n\nin \n\n\n\n697 \n\n\n\nMountain whenever possible, because imperishable gold was the metal of \n\napotheosis and immortality, making the body imperishable also. 25 In the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ west, where gold was not plentiful, the magic mountain was said to be \nmade of glass or crystal, in imitation of the seven crystalline spheres of \nheaven. The Celtic after-world centered on a glass castle, perhaps a \nmisunderstanding of the old word glas, meaning "the blue of heav- \nen." 26 But the crystal mountain was sometimes taken literally. At the \nCeltic burial mound of New Grange, the surface of the earth-womb wa \nonce covered by quartz fragments to make it sparkle in the sun like a \nmound of crystal. 27 The Slavs believed in a crystalline mountain of \nheaven, and used to bury bear\'s claws with the dead, to help them \nscramble up the slippery glass. 28 \n\nThe expression "in seventh heaven" came from the ancient \nbelief that the seven celestial spheres were arranged like a seven-story \nmountain, as shown by the Babylonian ziggurat of seven stages. 29 \nBelow ground, seven concentric "hells" or "pits" reflected the celestial \nrealm in Sheol, its mirror image in the Abyss, ruled by the queen of \nthe underworld, who had many names Allatu, Eresh-kigal, Persepho- \nne, Hel, Hecate, Nephthys, or the earlier female Pluto but always a \ndark alter ego of the celestial Goddess. 30 \n\nThe Babylonian netherworld was "divided into seven zones, like \nthose of Dante\'s Inferno, upon the model of the seven planetary \n\nspheres. . . . Seven gates gave admission, each guarded by a porter \n\nThis idea of the circles of the underworld is also found in the \nEgyptian mythology of the ritual of the dead." Like the biblical Joseph, \nAssyrian priests went down into the Pit as part of their death-rebirth \ninitiations. There at the base of the celestial mountain in the land of the \nBlack Sun, stood "the foundations of the earth, the meeting of the \nmighty waters." 51 \n\nInitiations everywhere enacted a journey through the nether and \ncelestial spheres, a symbolic ascent of the mountain. The Norse \nfather-god Odin himself had to win his wisdom by traversing the "seven \nnether spheres" of death. 32 Apuleius described his own initiation into \nthe Mysteries of Isis as a journey to the land of death, where he beheld \nthe Black Sun, and saw the deities of the upper and lower worlds \n"face to face." Then he rose to the heights, and was exhibited to the \ncongregation in the costume of the sun god. Mithraic initiates \nsimilarly rose through seven spheres, winning the ranks of Raven, \nBridegroom, Warrior, Lion, Persian, Sun-runner, and Pater (high \npriest). 33 \n\nArabs perpetuated the basic Chaldean notion of the cosmos as a \nmagic mountain with seven ascending spheres and seven under- \nground ones; this in turn was based on the Hindu image of Purusha, the \nuniverse personified. "According to the common opinion of the \nArabs, there are seven heavens, one above the other, and seven earths, \n\n\n\n698 \n\n\n\none beneath another. . . . This is explained by a passage of the Koran Mountain \n\nI in which it is said that God created seven heavens and as many earths or \n\ni storeys of the earth." 34 Medieval Christians inherited the same idea, ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n| modeling their cosmos on that of ancient Chaldea. The church officially \n\n(listed the heavens as aerial, ethereal, Olympian, the heaven of fire, \n\nthe heaven of stars, the crystalline, and the Empyrean. In the seventh \n\njheaven "Christ dwells, and this is the especial and proper dwelling \n\niplace of Christ and the angels and saints." 35 \n\nThus the magic mountain was taken over by Christianity, but at \nthe same time the church vigorously condemned all the magic \nimountains where "witchcraft" carried on worship of the Goddess. Puy- \nde-D6me in Auvergne was a famous witch-mountain; so was the \nBrocken or Blocksberg in the Hartz Mountains. Puy-de-D6me had a \n(temple served by women called fatuae, "fairies" or "fates," and \n\\fatidicae, "seeresses." Young girls were periodically initiated into the \nsect, under the novice-title of bonnes EUes} 6 \n\nA map made of the Brocken in 175 1 noted that its summit was a \nwitches\' ground, where sabbats were celebrated before an altar by a \nmagic spring, "formerly consecrated to some false deity of the pa- \ngans." 37 This may have been the mountain Pope Pius II called Mons \nj Veneris, where one could meet witches and demons, "address them and \nlearn the magic arts." 38 \n\nThe story of Tannhauser\'s sojourn in the Mons Veneris or Mount \nof Venus (Venusberg) was another relic of fairy-religion, hinting at \nthe existence of a real high priestess powerful enough to defy the pope, \nand serving the Goddess under the name of Queen Sybil. The \nGoddess "still resided in the megalithic temples of western Europe, \nwhich were old before the Greeks invaded Greece. Although her \nrites were officially forbidden, her worship was celebrated on magical \nmountains throughout Europe. She came to be confused with the \nclassical goddess Venus, and her magic mountains were called Venus- \nbergs in Germany, where the written versions of the Tannhauser \nmyth seem to have originated. Her worship was celebrated at several \niireal mountains: Horselberg, Waldsee, Freiburg, and Wolkenstein, as \n\nwell as at peaks in Italy and Scotland In all the Tannhauser myths, \n\nthe Queen Sybil is the Goddess Venus." ?9 \n\nSybil was a Latinization of Cybele, the Great Mother of the Gods, \nwhose worship actually continued in secret up to the 20th century on \nIwild mountaintops in her native Anatolia. Her rites "contained primitive \nusages of the religion of Anatolia, some of which have survived to this \njday in spite of Christianity and Islam. Like the Kizil-Bash peasants of \nloday, the ancient inhabitants of the peninsula met on the summits of \njjmountains covered with woods no ax had desecrated, and celebrated \ntheir festal days." 40 \n\nThroughout the Middle Ages, men believed the Goddess could \n\n\n\n699 \n\n\n\nMourdad-Ameretat invite them into the interior of her magic mountain, as shown by \nMudra many tales Tannha*user was not the only Venus-loving hero. The \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ Danish ballad of The El fen Hill speaks of a youth enchanted by an \n\nelf-maid\'s dancing, and invited by her to the interior of her hill. 41 There \' \nwere even indications that the Mountain-goddess was still a trinity. \nAccording to the Thuringian Chronicle of 1 398, she appeared at mid- j \nday as three great flames in the air, "which presently ran together in \none great globe of flame, parted again and finally sank into the \nHorselbcrg." 42 \n\nThe Mother-mountains continued to shelter pagan gods, who \nwere thought to be not dead but sleeping in the terrestrial womb, \nawaiting rebirth like Hindu gods between their incarnations. Merlin, \nWilliam Tell, Barbarossa, Frederick, and others slept in magic moun- \ntains. Many were assimilated to "the figure of Wotan, which survi \nthese legends of emperors and empires. It is Wotan who is awaiting \nto reappear in this world ... a dark heathen god-image that has not been \ntaken into account by the prevailing attitude of consciousness. " 4 * \n\nI, Neumann.

Scipio the Elder said \nhe spheres "produce seven distinct tones; the septenary number is the \nlucleus of all that exists. And men, who know how to imitate this \nelestial harmony with the lyre, have traced their way back to the \nublime realm." 2 Led by Thalia, who governed music in general, the \nlassical Muses were Clio (history), Calliope (heroic poetry), Terpsicho- \ne (dance), Melpomene (tragedy), Erato (erotic poetry), Euterpe \nflute accompaniments), Polyhymnia (sacred songs), and Urania, the \nCelestial Aphrodite of the plane of the fixed stars.

Like the fish-mother Atargatis or Tirgata, she \npersonified the primal womb of the Abyss. 2 She espoused the sun god \nand "quenched the blazing lingam" in the waters of her womb, like all \npersonifications of the female Deep. 5 The ancient city of Mdina on \nMalta used to bear her name. 4 \n\n1.

Myrrh \nwas an emblem of Mara, a common Oriental name for the spirit of \ndeath. 5 \n\n\n\n702 \n\n\n\nSome scholars have offered a theory that myrrh was given Jesus on \n(the cross to deaden his pain, because of a Jewish tradition that "the \njkindly women of Jerusalem" used to give myrrh to "those who were led \njout to execution." 4 The theory cannot be supported, since myrrh has \n|no analgesic properties. The women of Jerusalem apparently had \nanother, less kindly reason for giving myrrh to those executed; even \nearly Christians remembered that myrrh meant the death and rebirth of \nja god and was identified with his holy mother. \n\nIn the lore of magic, myrrh was credited with power to cause \n[menstruation: perhaps a relic of ancient legends of the castrated god\'s \nihedding of the "blood of life." 5 \n\n1.

Tatz & Kent, 79. 2. Graves, G.M. 1,13. \n\n\n\nNakedness \n\nTantric sages said one should participate in religious rites "sky clad" \n(digambara) or naked, because in the eyes of the Goddess all distinction: \nof rank, caste, or class should be put off along with the clothing that \nexpressed them. 1 The Goddess herself appeared naked, under the nam< \nof Nagna, "Nudity." 2 It was widely recognized that the magic of the \nGoddess dwelt more in the reality of her flesh than in her garments, \nsince creation was a function of the female body, not of any external \naccouterments. 3 Moreover, it was her nakedness that exerted its mysteri \nous power over the bodies of men. Images of the Naked Goddess \neven decorated churches until 1 1th and 12th centuries a.d., especially \nin the British Isles. Though many were destroyed, some of these \nimages still survive. 4 \n\nBy contrast to this earlier emphasis on nakedness, the magic of \nmen and their gods usually dwelt in their garments. Odin\'s sayings in \nthe Havamal show that he gave men clothes by which they would put \non "nobility" i.e., power for "the naked man is naught." 5 Patriar- \nchal societies generally made much of uniforms, vestments, badges of \nrank, and other decorations by which men defined themselves. \n\nPerhaps out of this same sense that nakedness enhanced the power \nof women and reduced that of men, Christians were usually opposed \nto nakedness even when it was practical, as among tropical peoples. \nAustralian missionaries refused to give food to hungry natives until \nthey put on clothes. A missionary in the Orinoco regretted that the \nnatives had not really accepted Christianity, but he confessed himself \n\n\n\n706 \n\n\n\nI "greatly consoled" at having taught native women such modesty that Nakedness \n\nI they would no longer remove their clothes even in bed. 6 \n\nEarly Christians condemned nakedness because it was characteris- ^ ^^ \nI tic of worship of the Goddess. The legend of St. Barnabas tells of the \n\nsaint\'s miraculous destruction of the temple of Aphrodite at Paphos, \n\nwere he saw "a multitude of men and women celebrating a feast, and \n\nrunning about naked. So wroth was he that he cursed the temple of \n\nthese pagans, and instantly the temple fell in ruins, crushing a large \n\nnumber of pagans in its fall." 7 \n\nA 4th-century Christian bishop named Priscillian seems to have \nI participated in pagan rites. He gave himself to "abominable studies, \n\nand held nightly meetings with immodest women and had been \n\naccustomed to pray stark naked." 8 \n\nMedieval books on sorcery taught that spirits can be raised by \nI ceremonial nudity, but this kind of magic is a degradation which "the \n\nfoolish dotage of women is subject to fall into." 9 Women continued to \n\nbelieve in the power of nakedness. Scottish maidens stripped them- \nI selves naked on the Eve of St. Andrew and recited a prayer "to learn \n\nwhat sort of husbands they shall have." 10 Pierre de Lancre wrote that \n\n"witches in their accursed assemblies are either entirely naked or en \nI chemise." 11 Up to the 17th century, ancient fertility rites dictated the \n\ngrinding of grain for festival cakes in Ireland with "certain stones," by \n\ngirls who had to be completely naked at the time. 12 \n\nAt the Bulgarian ceremony of the need-fire, "two young men \n\n\'whose names must not be spoken\' marched in front of the flocks and \n\nherds which were to be driven through the flames, and afterwards \n\nstripped themselves naked and kindled the new fire in a wood." At a \ni similar ceremony in Serbia, "a naked boy and girl lit the fire by rubbing \nj rollers of wood together." n Even in the present century, Balkan \ni peasants and gypsies performed ceremonies requiring them to go naked \nI in moonlight. 14 Witches sometimes maintain the "sky-clad" tradition, \nI as in the Middle Ages they were often accused of worshipping the \nj "great Devil" in the form of a large star when they went out naked at \n; night. Some medieval heretics called "shepherds" insisted on saying \nI Mass while naked, on the theory that "this was the way our father \n\nAdam sacrificed." The Inquisition condemned them, on the ground \n: that Adam didn\'t say Mass at all. 15 \n\nSt. Jerome established the church\'s policy on female nakedness by \n\nsaying women should be so ashamed of their own bodies that they \n\nshould "blush and feel overcome" at the sight of themselves. For this \n\nreason, no "virgin of full age" should bathe. If she was good-looking, \n\na woman must try to spoil her appearance by "a deliberate squalor" so \n\nshe wouldn\'t distract saintly men from their pure thoughts. 16 Among \n\nmedieval nuns therefore, clothing was seldom changed, and dirtiness \ni was thought next to godliness. \n\nIn the 1 5th century, the Adamites of Bohemia associated naked- \n\n\n\n707 \n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\nness with humanity\'s pristine purity, quoting the Bible (Genesis 3:7) \nto prove that garments were worn only after the first sin was committed. \nThey advocated nudity and free love to liberate the flesh from \nsinfulness. Their sect was exterminated in 1421. 17 \n\nNakedness often figured in secret initiations, as advised in a Frencl \nmystical book: "The aspirant should become stark naked, should \nempty himself completely, should be stripped of all his faculties, \nrenouncing all his own predilections, his own thoughts, his own \nwill in a word, his whole self." 18 Even here the "self" seemed to be \nclosely identified with the clothes which, as the world knows, \n"make the man." \n\n1.

"Irish ainm \nis \'name\' and anim is \n\'soul, anima.\' In cer- \ntain cases they are \ndeclined alike and \ntherefore often con- \nfused by students." ? \n\n\n\nName \n\nFor the purposes of magic and religion, the name of anything was \nconsidered identical with the thing itself, a spiritual "handle" by which \nthe thing or the supernatural being could be manipulated. Children \nand primitives seldom distinguish clearly between the reality and the \nname of an object. 1 The childlike mind of the Middle Ages couched \nthe same thought in pseudo-rational terms: "The proper names of \nthings are certain rays of things, everywhere present at all times, \nkeeping the power of things, as the essence of the thing signified." 2 \nLike other Europeans, ancient Britons believed the name and the \nsoul were the same. 4 \n\nEach Egyptian\'s soul-name, the ren, was breathed by a mother on \nher child as it was first put to her breast; therefore the Goddess of \nsoul-names was Renenet, who governed lactation. Without its ren, the \nchild would have no identity and would not be allowed to eat. Even \nthe gods needed mothers to give them names, otherwise they would \npine away and die. 5 The same belief is found in India: the "thousand- \neyed god" named Existence cried immediately after he was born, "Give \nme a name, for without a name I will not eat food." 6 \n\nName-giving was often connected with food-giving. The French \nstill give a child a nom de kit, milk-name, obviously recalling the pre- \nChristian matriarchy where only mothers could give names. 7 Chinese \nchildren received a "rice-name" with the first rice; it was supposed to \nembody the soul and was kept secret. 8 According to the Bible, infants \nwere named by their mothers, not their fathers. 9 Adam\'s naming of \nthe animals, however, was a magical means of making Adam their \nfather, after the manner of Shiva under his title of Prajapati, "Father \nof the Animals." \n\nTransitions from matriarchy to patriarchy were marked by fathers\' \n\n\n\n708 \n\n\n\ntakeover of the name-giving function. Brahmans insisted that fathers, Name \n\nnot mothers, breathed the essential soul-name into children; thus the \n\nsoul of a Brahman was called Atman, "the Breath," from which came m^mmm^^m^^^ \n\nGreek atmos and German atmen. At each Brahman wedding, long lists \ni of "begats" were recited to establish paternal ancestry. Imitators of \nS this eastern custom contributed the lists of spurious "begats" in the Old \ni Testament. 10 \n\nAncestor worship was instituted in matriarchal times, when tribal \nmothers became goddesses who gave their children names. When \npatriarchs became synonymous with gods, the system was copied for the \nother sex. Egyptian priests of Ra claimed their deity created all other \ngods by naming them: "It is Ra who made his own names into his \ni members, and these became the gods who are in his following. . . . \ni Ra created the Company of the Gods out of his own names." l \' This \n; was intended to uphold the priests\' contention that any god one cared \nto name was really Ra in disguise. But in a primeval time, Ra himself ex- \nisted only as a name within the being of his Mother, Ma-Nu, the \ncosmic abyss. 12 \n\nEgyptians remembered that the secret name embodying the soul \njwas mother-given. So did the Phoenicians, Babylonians, Scythians, \nI and Celtic and Germanic tribes who called themselves by mother\'s \nj names, which encompassed the tribal soul. 13 "Ask a Lycian who he \njis," Herodotus wrote, "and he answers by giving his own name, that of \nhis mother, and so on in the female line." H \n\nDespite Brahmanism, most of India retained the ancient system of \nmaternal name-giving. Distribution of family names was governed by \nthe Goddess under her title of Samjna or Saranyu, "the Name," or \n"Sign." 15 Chinese family names similarly incorporated the Mother- \nsign, a custom known to date back to the matriarchal age, before people \nknew their fathers. 16 The Japanese didn\'t use patronymics until 1400 \n|a.d. Previously, children took their mothers\' names. 17 See \nMotherhood. \n\nHellenic Greeks dated their transition from mother-names to \n\\ father-names back to a quarrel between the god Poseidon and the \ngoddess Athene. She won, but he oppressed the people to enforce his \ndemands. Athenian women were deprived of the vote, and men were \nforbidden to take their mother\'s names as they had done before. 18 \n\nEven when calling themselves "patrician" (father-descended), Ro- \ntman clans kept the feminine names originating in the pre- Roman \nmatriarchate, where only mothers embodied clan spirit. 19 The fact that \ni Roman women bore clan names like Julia, Claudia, Cornelia, Lucre- \nItia, etc., has been misunderstood as evidence of social oppression. \nI Bullough said, "Until fairly late in Roman history women even \nlacked individual names in the proper sense of the term . . . ; mothers \ni and daughters would have the same name." 20 He missed the point: \n! women bore the clan name because they embodied the clan soul, \nlipassed in matrilineal succession from mother to daughter. \n\n\n\n709 \n\n\n\nName The wholly patriarchal Christian system maintained patronymics \n\nthroughout. In nomenclature, women hardly existed at all. The only \n^ i name a woman kept for herself was her baptismal name, sacrosanct \nbecause it was ratified by a male god. Christian baptism didn\'t \nmention surnames, because in the middle ages there were still common- \nlaw rules providing for maternal surnames. Christian women received \nthe surnames of their fathers, but after marriage even these were given \nup, so the children inherited no name from the female line. Christian \nfathers like Brahman fathers gave children their names by speaking or \nsometimes writing them; hence the term "author of my being." Yet \nthe matronymic survived in some places, such as Spain, even though \nchurch councils declared maternal surnames illegal. 21 Scandinavia \nremained pagan up to the 1 1th century and retained older systems of \nnomenclature. Scandinavian women didn\'t take their husbands\' sur- \nnames until the 1 8th century. 22 \n\nThe great importance attached to names goes back to the \nearliest ages, and probably bears a profound psychological relationship t( \nthe human animal\'s unique ability to verbalize. Names were con- \nfused with souls almost everywhere. Egyptians said "To speak the name \nof the dead is to make them live again." Tomb inscriptions begged \npassers-by to speak the name of the entombed, to give "the breath of life \nto him who has vanished." 25 No greater harm could be done to an \nEgyptian than to erase the carving or writing of his name. To destroy \nthe very letters meant destruction of the soul. 24 \n\nRomans also wanted to preserve the name-soul after death. Romar \nepitaphs asked the passer-by to read the name aloud. Wealthy \nRomans often established endowments for a guild of friends and their \nsuccessors to celebrate their names at a banquet, at stated intervals on \nthe anniversary of death. 25 The Christian practice of writing names on \ntombstones developed from the Roman practice of re-creating the \nsoul in speech. \n\nSome said a major purpose of the epitaph was to induce deities to \nspeak the name, which would insure immortality because any word \nspoken by a god became reality. The spoken name in a divine mouth \nwould re-create the actual man. The pharaoh Sesostris I (1965-1934 \nB.C.) had his name inscribed on the benben-stone (obelisk), remarking \nthat "A name that standeth thereupon is mentioned [by the gods] and \nperisheth not in eternity." 26 For the same reason, Babylonian kings \nprayed to the Goddess Ishtar to give life to their names. 27 \n\nOn the other hand, a man or god could be cursed if his secret, \nmagical name was learned by an enemy and spoken in the wrong \ncontext. Isis spoke the secret soul-name of Ra to destroy him at the end \nof his daily cycle, making him an old man tottering feebly toward his \ndeath at sunset. 28 Knowledge of his name brought destruction to \nRumpelstiltzkin in the fairy tale, which may have been a late version \nof the myth of Ra and Isis. \n\nAt times the Goddess invoked the power of her own name, or \n\n\n\n710 \n\n\n\nseveral of her names, to release forces of creation or destruction. Isis Name \n\nI brought Osiris back to life by invoking herself as Isis and Nephthys. 29 \n\nI She fought the dragon of darkness and "obtained mastery over him in ^^^ mmm ^^^^^ \n\n| her name of Sekhet, she overpowered him in her name of Khut-nebat \nI (Eye of Flame)." 50 Names of the Goddess of creation and destruc- \nI tion were incongruously applied to Yahweh under his pagan-inspired \ni title El Schadaj related to schadajim, "milk-giving breasts," and \nI schadaj, "to destroy." 31 \n\nPrecedents older than civilization evolved the idea that forces of \n\ncreation and destruction could be activated by pronouncing a divine \nj name. The Mother of Gods controlled her offspring by knowledge of \nI their secret names. Early priestly theory proposed that these secret \nj names could be learned by human beings, who could then control the \n\ngods with them. Brahman priests claimed to control the gods\' actions \n\nwith mantras incorporating the divine names. Some of their lore was \n| embodied in the Upanishads, which means "secret names." 32 The \nj name of the Amida Buddha was so powerful that a priest could send \n\nhimself or any other man to the Western Paradise immediately only \n| by uttering it. 33 \n\nNaturally, priesthoods kept the knowledge of these dread names to \n{ themselves, as it would never do to let ordinary folk use them for free. \n\nHence the Jews\' taboo on taking the name of the Lord in vain. \n; Common people of the Semitic tribes didn\'t know their gods\' real \nI names; they called them simply El or Baal or Adonai, "the Lord." \ni When the name of the Jewish God became more widely known, the \n\nrabbis said its magic lay in its correct pronunciation, which could be \n\ncommunicated only once every seven years from an elder priest to a \n\nyounger. 34 The name was written on phylacteries which were said to \n\nkeep the bearer from every evil after many repetitions of the syllables. \n\nLearned Jews said "God brought Israel out of Egypt by means of a \n\nName which consisted of seventy-two Names." 35 \n\nThe Islamic Allah was even better equipped, with ninety-nine \n\nsecret names. Moslems claimed he would be compelled to answer \n\nany prayer if all these names were pronounced. Allah himself was called \n\n"the Essential Name," originally the milk-giving Goddess Al-Lat. 36 \n\nPious Moslems invoked Allah\'s name before sexual intercourse so no \n\nevil spirit could enter the womb and beget an evil child. 37 \n\nBoth Moslems and Christians inherited Jewish name-magic and \n\nbelieved that all sorts of miracles could be worked by invoking the \n\nname of God or the name of Christ, to say nothing of their secret \n\nnames. In the Middle Ages it was believed that any priest could \n\nabsolutely compel God to do whatever was asked, by conducting a Mass \n\nof the Holy Spirit which mentioned God\'s secret name. 38 The \n\npowers of God\'s name were explained by Henry Morley as follows: \n\nWhoever knows the true pronunciation of the name Jehovah the name \nfrom which all other divine names in the world spring as the branches \nfrom a tree, the name that binds together the sephiroth whoever has that \n\n\n\n711 \n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\nOrigen (Origenes \nAdamantius) Christian \nfather, ca. 185-254 \na.d., an Egyptian who \nwrote in Greek, \nexerting a powerful \ninfluence on the early \nGreek church. At first \nhe was accounted a \nsaint, but three \ncenturies after his \ndeath he was declared \na heretic because of \nGnostic elements \nfound in his writings. \n\nEnchiridion A book \nof magic spells, charms, \nand secret names \nallegedly written by \nPope Leo the Great, \nwho presented it to \nCharlemagne to in- \nsure his continuing \ngood luck. \n\n\n\nin his mouth has the world in his mouth. When it is spoken angels are \nstirred by the waves of sound. It rules ail creatures, works all miracles, it \ncommands all the inferior names of deity which are borne by the \nseveral angels that in heaven govern the respective nations of the earth. J9 \n\nEarly in the Christian era, when Christians were struggling to \nseparate their sect from Judaism, many stories were invented to prove \nthe name of Christ superior in magic efficacy to the name of God. \nOne such story from the Life of Pope Silvester told of a duel of holy \nnames performed by the pope and a Jewish rabbi, in the presence of \nthe Empress Helena, mother of Constantine. The Jew said God\'s secret \nname was so powerful that no unprepared creature could hear it and \nlive. To prove his point, he whispered the name into the ear of a bull, \nwhich immediately fell dead. Then the pope pronounced the secret \nname of Christ in the dead bull\'s other ear, saying, "Bull, arise; go back \nto thy herd"; and the bull got up and went. 40 Silvester scoffed at the \nJew\'s claim to mastery of the divine name\'s fatal power, asking him, \n"How is it, then, that thou thyself hast heard this Name and hast not \ndied?" 41 The Jew didn\'t answer. \n\nBoth Jewish and Christian Gnostics focused on the power of \ndivine names to bring about healing, exorcism, absolution, and \nsalvation. In the Pistis Sophia, Jesus told his disciples to "hide the \nmystery" of a great Name that could dissolve evil and "blot out all \nsins, done knowing or not knowing." 42 According to the Gospels, this \nwas the esoteric secret that Jesus concealed from all but his intimates. \nThe masses were not told, "lest at any time they should be converted, \nand their sins should be forgiven them" (Mark 4:1 1), indicating that \nearly Christianity like other mystery-religions addressed itself to a \nfavored few. Jesus gave the disciples his secret name, which had \npower to exorcise, when he said "In my name shall they cast out devils" \n(Mark 16:17). Seventy of his followers told him, "Lord, even the \ndevils are subject unto us through thy name" (Luke 10:17). Origen said \nJesus\'s name had "expelled myriads of evil spirits from the souls and \nbodies of men." 45 According to the Enchiridion, the powers of Jesus\'s \nname were so far-reaching that it was hard to see how anything could \npossibly go wrong in a world where it was spoken: \n\nO sacred Name, Name which strengthens the heart of man, Name of life, \nof salvation, of joy, precious Name, resplendent, glorious, agreeable \nName, which fortifies the sinner, Name which saves, conserves, leads and \nrules all . . . wheresoever the most sweet Name of Jesus is pronounced \n. . . the demons take flight, every knee is bent, all temptations, even the \nworst, are scattered, all infirmities are healed, all disputes and conflicts \nbetween the world, the flesh and the devil are ended, and the soul is rilled \nwith every heavenly delight. H \n\nThe esoteric secrets of Judeo-Christian name-magic were bor- \nrowed from Egypt, where the angels of light baffled the forces of \ndarkness with words of power, and set forth in works like the Book of \n\n\n\n712 \n\n\n\nlEnoch, which depicted the archangel Michael battling dark angels with Name \n\nIsimilar words: \n\nThis is the number ofKesbeel, who showed the head of the oath to the \n\nholy ones when he dwelt high above in glory, and its name is Beqa. \n\nAnd this angel requested Michael to show him the hidden name, that they \n\nmight mention it in the oath, so that those who revealed all that was \n\nhidden to the children of men might quake before that name and oath. \n\nAnd this is the power of that oath, for it is powerful and strong, and he \n\nplaced this oath Akae in the hand of Michael. 4t . \n\nThis passage was garbled Egyptian resurrection-magic. "Those \njwho revealed all that was hidden" were the serpent deities who gave \nimankind holy secrets, against the will of heaven. "The oath Akae" \njwas Aqa, the rudder of the boat of the dead, "shiner in the water, \nhidden beam." The name of Aqa had to be spoken before a dead \nIman could enter the boat that plied the heavenly Lake of Reeds. 46 It was \namong the words of power by which Ra\'s angels battled the dragon of \nnight: "When these gods rich in, magic spoke, it was the very spirit (ka) \nDf magic, for they were ordered to annihilate my enemies by the \neffective charms of their speech." 47 \n\nEthiopian and Abyssinian Christians retained the notions of \nEgyptian paganism in regard to words of power (hekau). Their vision of \npie War in Heaven was simply the battle between Ra and the serpent \nbf darkness. They said God\'s armies were twice overthrown, and Satan \nwas about to assume control of the universe, when God sent his \nangels one last time into the fight, armed with a cross of light bearing \nthe three secret names of the trinity. "When Satan saw the Cross and \nthe Three Names of Power, his boldness and courage forsook him, his \narms lost their strength and the weapons which he was wielding fell \nfrom them and he and his hosts turned their backs and were hurled \ndown into the abyss of hell by the now invincible angels of God." \nThe same trinity, however, came into being from the same abyss, the \nGreat Mother Ma-Nu, within whom the triple male god "at first \nexisted in name only." 48 That is, he/they came into being because the \n[Mother spoke his/their name(s). It was believed that the very exis- \ntence of this trinity depended on continual mention of its/their holy \nname in the mouths of men. \n\nEgyptian faith in the efficacy of speaking the trinitarian name was \nlaken over by Christians, who viewed "In the name of the Father, of \nihe Son, and of the Holy Ghost" as a magic formula second to none. It \ncould cure disease, chase away vermin, protect worldly goods and \nacquire more of them. 49 Pope Alexander III forbade monks to study \nmedicine, on the ground that all sickness was caused by demonic \n([possession and the only proper remedy was exorcism by the trinity\'s \noly names. 50 \n\nHoly names constituted the effective portion of any Christian \nremony. Absolution gave a typical formula: "I absolve thee from all \ny sins in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy \n\n\n\n713 \n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\nHenry Cornelius \nAgrippa von Nette- \n\nsheim (1486-1535) \nAustrian military officer, \nscholar, court histori- \nographer, and magus; \nauthor of the famous \nOccult Philosophy, \nwhich attempted to \nreconcile magic, theol- \nogy, physics, \nmathematics, alchemy, \nand cabalism. \n\n\n\nSpirit." Extreme unction was a string of invocations; \'in the Name of \nthe Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, may there be \nextinguished in thee every power of the Devil by the imposition of \nour hands, and by the invocation of all the holy Angels, Archangels, \nPatriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Virgins, and all \nthe Saints." Even longer lines of holy names marched through the \nlitany for the dying: "Go forth, Christian soul, from this world in the \nName of God the Father Almighty, who created thee; in the Name of \nthe Holy Spirit, who was poured out upon thee; in the Name of the \nholy and glorious Mother of God, the Virgin Mary," and so on, \nthrough long lists. Holy water for dedicating a church was exorcised \nwith the formula: "I conjure thee thou creature of water, in the name oi \nthe father, and of the son, and of the Holy-ghost, that thou drive the \ndevil out of every corner and hole of this church, and altar; so as he \nremain not within our precincts." 51 \n\nThe holy names were not merely symbols. Words spoken "in the \nname of Jesus" or "in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost" \nwere supposed to have absolute efficacy in expelling demons from \naltars, candles, fonts, even church hassocks, just as Egyptian hekau \ncould expel demons from a pyramid. 52 Certainly man never invented a \nweapon easier to use against the evil powers that he felt threatening \nhim on all sides. Nothing could induce him to abandon it, then or now. \n\nAgrippa von Nettesheim tried to explain the efficacy of holy name \nin pseudo-rational style, ending with a wholly irrational description of \nsuch names as "vehicles of Divine omnipotence, not fixed by men or by \nangels but by the great God himself in a certain way according to a \nnumber and figure which are unchangeable by reason of their eternal \nstability; they breathe the harmony of Divinity and are sanctified by \nGod\'s help. . . . The heavenly powers fear these Divine names, Hell \ntrembles at them, the angels worship them, the bad demons dread \nthem, all creatures revere them." 53 \n\nYet infernal names were considered just as effective as divine ones. \nRomanians converted the pagan Mother Death into a witch from the \nMount of Olives, called Avestitza, or "Wing of Satan." She was \ndangerous to most human beings, but could not harm anyone who \nlearned and wrote down her nineteen secret names. 54 \n\nPriests and magicians, Christian or pagan, operated on the same \npremise that the names of supernatural beings would call them and \ncompel them to perform the required task. Magic books and church \nliturgies were near akin in intention. One typical book of necromancy \nprovided impressive lists of secret names, guaranteed to work. \n\nThis is the earliest name ofTyphon, at which tremble the earth, the abyss, \nHades, heaven, the sun, the moon, the place of the stars and the whole \nphenomenal universe. When this name is spoken, it carries along with its \nforce gods and demons. It is the hundred-lettered name, the same \nname as last written. And when thou hast uttered it, the god or the dead \nperson who hears it will appear to thee and will answer concerning the \n\n\n\n714 \n\n\n\nthings you ask. And when you have learned all things, dismiss the god only \nwith the strong name, the one of the hundred letters, saying "Begone, \nLord, for thus wills and commands the great god!" Say the name and he \nwill depart. ss \n\nAnother source mixed Jewish and Greek gods in a spell for \njailing a spirit of divination into a vessel of water, also for breaking \nmains, blinding enemies, bringing dreams and divine favors. \n\nI invoke thee who created the earth and the bones (rocks) and all flesh and \nspirit and established the sea, and shakes the heavens and did divide the \nlight from the darkness, the great ordering mind, who disposes all, the \neverlasting eye, Demon of Demons, God of Gods, the Lord of Spirits, \nthe unwandering Aeon. Iao ouei, hearken unto my voice. I invoke thee \nthe ruler of the gods, high-thundering Zeus, O king Zeus Adonai, O \nLord Jehovah. lam he who invokes thee in the Syrian tongue as the great \ngod Zaaler iphphou (Baal-zephon), and do not disregard the sound in \nHebrew ablanathanalba abrasiloa. S6 \n\nThe longer and more sonorous the spell, the more holy or \njly names it mentioned, the more effective it was supposed to be. A \nal love-charm invoked Greek, Egyptian, and Babylonian under- \nld deities, as it was placed on a grave to carry the message down to \ni via the deceased. \n\nI place this charm down beside you, subterranean gods, Kore, Persepho- \nne, Ereshkigal and Adonis, Hermes the subterranean, Thoth and the \nstrong Anubis, who hold the keys of those in Hades, the gods of the \nunderworld and the daimons, those untimely reft away, men, women, \nyouths and maidens, year by year, month by month, day by day, hour by \nhour. I conjure you, all daimons assembled here. . . . Betake yourself to \nthat place and that street and that house and bring her hither, and bind \nher. . . . Let her sleep with none other, let her have no pleasurable \nintercourse with any other man, save with me alone. Let her neither drink \nnor eat, nor love, nor be strong nor well, let her have no sleep except \nwith me, because I conjure you by the terrible terror-striking name of him, \nwho, when his name is heard, will cause the earth hearing it to open; \nthe daimons, hearing his fearful name, will be afraid, the rivers and the \nrocks, hearing his name, will burst. S7 \n\nThe Christian church taught that no demon could be exorcised \nefore his own name was known, following the example of Jesus \n\'ho demanded the names of the devils he cast out of the Gadarene \nMark 5:9). The Rituale Romanum printed in 1947 prescribed that a \nriest must demand the devil\'s name and rank, "and the devil, like a \nrisoner of war, was in honor bound to respond." 58 Precedents dated \nack, not only to the Gospels, but also to the Magic Papyri where secret \names of God were multiplied endlessly in the effort to learn a spirit\'s \name: \n\n/ conjure thee by the God of the Hebrews, Jesus, Jaba, Jae, Abraoth, Aia, \nThoth, Ele, Elo, Aeo, Eu, Jiibaech, Abarmas, Jabarau, Abelbel, Lona, \nAbra, Maroia, Arm, appearing in fire, thou, Tannetis, in the midst of \n\n\n\nName \n\n\n\nRituale Romanum \n\nCatholic handbook of \nrites and ceremonies, \nwith prescribed phrases \nand gestures for every \noccasion. \n\n\n\nMagic Papyri \nCollections of \nexorcisms, invocations, \ncharms, and spells \nwidely circulated during \nthe early Christian \nera, used as bases for \nlater grimoires and \nHermetic texts. \n\n\n\n715 \n\n\n\nName plains, and snow, and mists; let thine inexorable angel descend and put \n\ninto safe keeping the wandering demon of this creature whom God has \n\n_^____ created in his holy Paradise. For I pray to the Holy God, putting my \n\nreliance in Ammonipsentancho. I conjure thee with a flood of bold wore \nJakuth, Ablanathanalba, Akramm. . . . Thou art Abrasiloth, Allelu, Jelo- \nsai, Jael: I conjure thee by him who manifested himself to Osrael by nigh \nin a pillar of Are and in a cloud by day and who has saved his people \nfrom the hard tasks of Pharaoh and brought down on Pharaoh the Ten \nPlagues because he would not hearken. I conjure thee, demoniac spirit, \nto say who thou art. For I conjure thee by the seal Solomon placed upon \nthe tongue of Jeremiah that he might speak. Say therefore who thou \nart, a celestial being or a spirit of the airs. S9 \n\nOne rabbinical tradition anathematized Christian use of holy \nnames to bring about everything from exorcism to resurrection; but \nChristianity could hardly have existed without it. Jesus said, "I have \nmanifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me. . . . And I \nhave declared unto them thy name" (John 17:6, 26), copying the \nEgyptian magician\'s secret communication of a divine name: "I am he \nwhom you [the god] met under the holy mountain and to whom you \ngave the knowledge of your greatest Name, which I shall keep holy, \ncommunicating it to none save to your fellow initiates in your holy \nrites." 60 Magic books attributed to Pope Honorius, famed as a wizard \ndespite his pontifical rank, plainly listed the seventy-two secret names \nof God and demonstrated their use in conjurations. For any modern \\ \nreader who may wish to test their efficacy, they are: Trinitas, Sother, \nMessias, Emmanuel, Sabahot, Adonay, Athanatos, Jesu, Pentagna, \nAgragon, Ischiros, Eleyson, Otheos, Tetragrammaton, Ely, Saday, \nAquila, Magnus Homo, Visio, Flos, Origo, Salvator, Alpha et Omega, \nPrimus, Novissimus, Principium et Finis, Primogenitus, Sapientia, \nVirtus, Paraclitus, Veritas, Via, Mediator, Medicus, Salus, Agnus, Ovis \nVitulus, Spes, Aries, Leo, Lux, Imago, Panis, Janua, Petra, Sponsa, \nPastor, Propheta, Sacerdos, Sanctus, Immortalitas, Jesus, Christus, Pa- \nter, Filius Hominis, Pater Omnipotens, Deus, Agios, Resurrectio, \nMischiros, Charitas, Aeternas, Creator, Redemptor, Unitas, Summum \nBonum, Infinitas, Jehovah, Agla, Sady, Gog and Magog. 61 \n\nChristians maintained even up to the present day the old pagan \nbelief that to speak the name of a dead person could call up his ghost, \ntherefore such a name must be accompanied by the formula "God rest \nhim," to keep him in the grave where he belonged. Pliny said Roman \npagans used the same formula for speaking of the dead. 62 It was also \nthought a disaster to have a dying person carry one\'s name in his \nmouth through the passage into death. If a dying man cursed his enem; \nby name, the enemy would also die, obviously in accord with the \nancient belief that a name was a vital part of the soul. 65 \n\nOne tradition Christians deliberately forgot, however, was the \noldest of all: that mothers gave children their name-souls while \nbaptizing them with milk from their breasts. Pagan mothers continued \n\n\n\n716 \n\n\n\nD do this, well into the Middle Ages; but it was specifically stated that Nammu \n\nbch a matriarchal baptism was never given to the Christ child. 64 Nana \n\n\n\nI.

Oxenstierna, 34. ^^^^____^^^^^^^_ \n\n\n\n. \n\n\n\nNecromancy \n\nDivination by the dead," one of the world\'s most popular forms of \nmagic, still widely practiced under the new name of spiritualism or \nmediumship. The basic idea was (and is) direct communication with \nthe dead, to discover the secrets of the after-life and the future. \n\nThe idea of necromancy underlay every salvation cult. Every \nSavior came back from the land of death to tell his followers how to \navoid its pitfalls and attain blissful immortality. Such information consti- \ntuted the Mystery-teachings of Orphism, of Eleusis, of Samothrace, \n\nI land of the Dionysian cults as well as those of Osiris, Pan, Adonis, \n\n| Tammuz, Krishna, Balder, Zalmoxis, and Christ. But not only \n\n. Saviors and sacred kings returned from the land of death. Any ghost \n\nI could do so, if properly summoned. \n\nHomer depicts Odysseus performing necromancy with sheep\'s \n\nt jblood, to call the dead from Hades and speak with them. 1 A gift of \nblood was always most welcome to the "shades" who were bloodless. \nThis idea led on to medieval terrors like vampires and revenants who \n\ni came back from the grave in search of blood. \n\nThe Bible shows Saul incapable of practicing necromancy for \n\nI himself, as Odysseus did. To consult the ghost of Samuel, Saul \nneeded the help of the wise-woman miscalled the "witch" of Endor. \nThe text does not describe her as a witch, but as a "woman that hath \n\n| a familiar spirit" (1 Samuel 28:7). She is an obvious fraud, presenting to \nSaul under cover of darkness an obscure figure hidden in a mantle, \nspeaking in whispers, as ghosts were supposed to do. Saul, overcome by \nsuperstitious terror, bows his face to the ground and never even tries \n\ni to get a good look at the apparition (1 Samuel 28:14). \n\nRomans also had necromantic specialists, though the ordinary \n\n> citizen could deal in a small way with ancestral ghosts, making \n\ni offerings to them on the nights of the Lemuria. 2 Once each year, priests \n\ni called up the ghosts dwelling in the pit under the lapis manalis or \n"soul stone" in the Forum, to consult them for omens. 3 \n\nNorthern tribes had similar customs, consulting ancestral ghosts at \nSamhain, the Feast of the Dead, which became Christians\' All \nHallows or Halloween. "Ghost" and "guest" both descended from \n\nBGermanic Geist because the death\'s-heads really did attend the feasts \nlas honored guests. 4 \n\nChristians also believed in, and practiced, necromancy. St. Clem- \n\n[ |ent the Roman, called the third pope after Peter, paid a necromancer \na large sum of money to call up a spirit from the underworld and \n(question it concerning the after-life. 5 Raising the dead Lazarus to life \n\n\n\n719 \n\n\n\nNehellenia \nNehushtan \n\n\n\nRituale Romanum \n\nCatholic handbook of \nrites and ceremonies, \nwith prescribed phrases \nand gestures for every \n\n\n\nagain for a while was one of the miracles that defined the divinity ol; \nChrist; yet, Scot asked, how is that "witches do the same, and it is \ncalled necromancy?" 6 \n\nNecromancy came to be known as "black magic" through a \nlinguistic blunder. The Greek root nekros, a corpse, was corrupted to j \nLatin niger, "black"; this gave nigromancy, the "black art." 7 \n\nA curious necromantic notion of the resurrection of the flesh \nunderlay the church\'s procedure for canceling excommunication of a \ncorpse. The Rituale Romanum said: \n\nIf the body be not yet buried, let it be lightly beaten with a rod or small \ncords after which it shall be absolved. . . . But if it hath been already \nburied in unconsecrated ground, if it may be conveniently done, let the \nbody be exhumed, and after it hath been lightly beaten in like manner \nand then absolved let it be buried in consecrated ground; but if the body \n\ncannot conveniently be disinterred, then the grave shall be beaten \n\nAnd if the body be already buried in consecrated ground, it shall not be \ndisinterred, but the grave shall be lightly beaten. 8 \n\nAs a rule, Christian authorities reserved for themselves all \ndealings with the dead and regarded any lay necromantic or spiritualist \nactivities as heresy, if not diabolism. In 1866 the Second Plenary \nCouncil of Baltimore forbade the faithful to attend seances, even if \nmotivated only by idle curiosity; "for some, at least, of the manifesta- \ntions must necessarily be ascribed to Satanic intervention since in no \nother manner can they be understood or explained." \n\n1.

Even Zeus feared \nNemesis, for she was once his destroyer and devourer, the Goddess \nwho gave both birth and death to all gods. 4 She was sometimes entitled \nAdrasteia, the Inescapable One. 5 \n\n1.

Mariette Bey wrote: "At the head of the \ngyptian pantheon soars a God who is one, immortal, uncreated, \njvisible and hidden in the inaccessible depths of his [sic] essence; he \nic] is the creator of the heavens and of the earth; he [sic] has made \nverything which exists and nothing has been made without him [sic]." \nbe Rouge gushed: "The unity of a supreme and self-existent being, \nis [sic] eternity, his [sic] almightiness, and eternal reproduction thereby \ni God; the immortality of the soul, completed by the dogma of \nunishments and rewards; such is the sublime and persistent base which \n1 . must secure for the beliefs of the ancient Egyptians a most \nonorable place among the religions of antiquity." \' \n\nDe Rouge and Mariette spoke of the concept of neter (also \nindered nether, nuter, or Nu), usually translated "God" or "gods" \nliough several of the seven Hathors had the name of Neter. They ruled \nie womb of rebirth, the seven-layered after-world known as Khert- \njleter or Neter-Khertet. 2 Male gods were called neter only when they \ntore artificial breasts. 3 Neteritox nutrit, "nurturer," was a common \n/nonym for "Goddess." 4 She-nit or She-neterv/ere Fate-goddesses \nwho form the conditions of the lives of men." 5 \n\nThe Book of the Dead distinguished between gods and the netriox \n\'utri: "I am devoted in my heart without feigning, O thou netri more \nnan gods." A king was told that in his after-life he lived "by the side of a \nieter" like a Hindu god with his shakti. Every king was warned that \n|e was "only the guardian of goods and provisions which belonged to \nhe neter." She provided all subsistence, and property, and children; \nhid she opposed would-be tyrants. 6 \n\nNeter netri was defined as "self-produced, primeval matter," the \n>cean of uterine blood before creation, holding future forms in the \nondition of formlessness or Chaos. Scholars actually translated this \noncept "Lake of God." 7 Its real meaning lay in the root syllable Nu, \n\n\n\nvar. Nether, Nuter, \nNu \n\n\n\nAuguste Mariette \n\n(1821-1881) French \nEgyptologist, discov- \nerer of the ruins of the \nSerapeum at Mem- \nphis, excavator at \nKarnak and other \nsites. He achieved the \nEgyptian ranks of \nBey and Pasha. \n\n\n\n723 \n\n\n\nNeter or Nut, "an ocean infinite in extent and of fathomless depth, bearing \n\nthe germs of all kinds of life," like Kali\'s primordial womb. The \n^ ma ^^ power of Nu was "the self-created," "maker of the gods," and "creato: \nof men." She existed before the sky, the earth, mortals, or gods. \nFrom Nu the sun was born; therefore Nu and the Great Mother were \none and the same. 8 \n\nThe sun went back into Mother Nu\'s "great gate" in the west \nwhen he died. Nu was also the hieroglyphic symbol of water that the \nGoddess Nut carried on her crown. Nu was the Triple Goddess, show \nin tomb carvings as three cauldrons. Nu "maketh fertile the watery \nmass of heaven, and maketh to come forth water on the mountains to \ngive life to men." 9 Nu became the Semitic nun, primal sea personi- \nfied as the Fish-mother (see Fish). She was incarnate in the sacred \nharlots of Erech, known as nu-gig. 10 \n\nThis primal sea was likened to the menstrual blood of the Great \nMother Goddess Tiamat, the creatress, who menstruated for three \nyears and three months to produce enough life-giving essence to give \nbirth to the universe. 11 This flow was the Nether Upsurge, or \nFountain of the Deep, emanating from her "holy door" designated by \nthe letter dahth or delta, the sign of the yoni. (See Demeter; \nTriangle.) \n\nWith a vowel point, dahth formed the Hebrew word ed, errone- \nously translated "mist" in Genesis 2:6: "But there went up a mist \nfrom the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground." The origin \nmeaning was not "mist" but something like a mighty fountain or \nspring, an unexplained upwelling of fluid from the bowels of the earth, \nwhich soaked the ground (adamah) to make it fertile, before the \nsending of rain from Father Heaven. This was what other Middle- \nEastern scriptures called the Nether Upsurge: female fluid from the \ndeeps, bursting forth to meet a male fluid from the clouds. 12 Other \nOriental sources show that the original sacrament of creation called \nfor a meeting of semen and menstrual blood "like the pouring of water \ninto water," as in the meeting and mingling of the powers of Kali and \nShiva, or of Tiamat and Apsu. Subsequently, adamah brought forth lift \n\nAdamah really meant "blood-red soil," and other myths clearly \nstate that the Nether Upsurge from the interior of Mother Earth was \nnot mist but life-giving uterine blood. The ancients often likened blood \nto salt water, which was regarded as the arche, the first of all elements \nfrom which the others were born. 13 Salt water was "birth fluid" \n(natron), representing regenerative Mother-blood. And Mother- \nblood was the vehicle of that world-creating spirit called neter, nether, \netc., which Egyptologists insisted on confusing with their own con- \ncept of God. \n\nTo the great and supreme Power which made the heavens, the gods, the \nearth, the sea, the sky, men and women, animals and creeping things, \nall that is and all that is yet to come into being, the Egyptians gave the \nname of neter or nether, a word which survives in Coptic under the \nform nuti . . . Dr. Brugsch defined neter to mean "the active power whic \n\n724 \n\n\n\nproduces and creates things in regular recurrence; which bestows new Nicholas, Saint \n\nlife upon them, and gives back to them their youthful vigor. . . " [T]he \n\ninnate conception of the word completely covers . . . the Latin natura ^^^^^^_^^^^_ \n\n. . . the great cosmic powers, and the beings who although held to be \n\n"divine" were yet finite and mortal . . . were called neteru, and the \n\nword is translated "gods" by Egyptologists. H \n\nIt seems, however, that "gods" didn\'t even begin to cover the \nue meaning of the ancient word neter, a relic of primitive matriarchal \nligion. Budge says: \n\nOne knows not exactly the meaning of the verb nuter, which forms the \nradical of the word neter, "god. " It is an idea analogous to "to \nbecome, " or "to renew oneself. " ... In other words, it has the meaning of \ngod, but it teaches us nothing as to the primitive value of this word. We \nmust be careful . . . not to let it suggest the modern religious or philosophi- \ncal definitions of god which are current today . . . ; neter appears to \nmean a being who has the power to generate life, and to maintain it when \ngenerated. IS \n\nNaturally, at the time when this crucial word was coined, the \nower to generate life was believed to be solely female (see Mother- \n:ood). It was the Goddess only who was "self-renewing" and the \njnirce of all "becoming." 16 Moreover, Egyptian writings contradict \nEgyptologists who want to call neterit "gods." The gods in the train \nr Ra were strongly differentiated from neterit, whom Ra\'s priests called \nWemptible beings. 17 In the time of Queen Hatshepsut, the neterit \nere not contemptible but divine beings; however, they "ruled without \na" and paid no attention to his commands. In some way they had \neen "made distant" and their footprints were gone from the earth. 18 \nlere it seems the neterit were nothing more nor less than deified \niiaternal ancestresses, like the matrikadevis of ancient India and the disk \ni Scandinavia. \n\nAfter the 20th dynasty the early religion of Egypt was fragmented \nhd lost in confusion under the rule of new patriarchal gods, like Ra. \nfudge says, "Knowledge of the early dynastic religion of Egypt pos- \nted by the priests in general after, let us say 1 200 B.C., was \nxtremely vague and uncertain. The result of this was to create in their \njligion a confusion which is practically unbounded." 19 \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 1, 138-39. 2. Book of the Dead, 126. 3. Larousse, 36. \n\n4. Maspero, 267. 5.

Nicholas was also equated with Woden. As European pagan \ndeities were Christianized, the benevolent aspect of Woden became \nSt. Nicholas (Santa Claus), who galloped over housetops during the \nwinter solstice as the elder god did, granting boons to his worshippers \nbelow. 3 \n\nIn Italy, St. Nicholas supplanted a female boon-giving deity calta \nThe Grandmother, or Pasqua Epiphania, or Befana, who used to fill \nthe children\'s stockings with her gifts. 4 The Grandmother was ousted \nfrom her shrine at Bari, which became the center of St. Nicholas\'s \ncult. Christian sailors carried the saint\'s image out to sea on his feast da \nas pagan sailors formerly carried the image of the sea god or goddess. 5 \nSome bones were collected in the 1 1th century a.d., installed in a \nchurch built at Bari to house them, and labeled the bones of \nSt. Nicholas. 6 \n\nThis was the real beginning of St. Nicholas\'s cult, though his \nChristian legend claimed (quite without foundation) that he had been \na bishop of Myra in the 4th century. His official biography was \npreposterous. As an infant he fasted, said the hagiographers, taking \nhis mother\'s breast only once on Wednesdays and Fridays. He became \na bishop on account of his predecessor\'s prophetic dream, because he \nwas the first man to enter the church next day. He resurrected the dea* \nfrom a magic cauldron. He instantly halted a violent storm at sea to \nsave three drowning sailors. He miraculously multiplied a shipment of \ngrain to feed a whole diocese for two years, with enough seed left \nover for future crops vastly surpassing Christ\'s miracle of the loaves \nand fishes. After his death he achieved even greater feats. His bones \nexuded a fountain of holy oil that could cure every disease. 7 \n\nThe original pagan god Nicholas gave rise to a Gnostic sect of \nNicolaites who worshipped him with his cauldron of regeneration as a \nfertility figure. They "held that the only way to salvation lay through \nfrequent intercourse between the sexes." 8 Like other worshippers of \nthe sexual fertility principle, pagan or Christian, the Nicolaites were \nsurpressed; but sexual symbolism persisted in the sigil of St. Nicho- \nlas\'s Day in the runic almanac: a furka combined with a yonic mandorl \nIn ancient Egypt, this was a sign of the phallus of Set in conjunction \nwith the goddess\'s genital oval. 9 Another symbol of St. Nicholas was th \ncluster of three golden balls, adopted as a crest of the Medici family \nand later as a sign of pawnbrokers. 10 \n\nThe Dutch called St. Nicholas Sinte Klaas, and carried his cult to \nthe New World where the name was corrupted to Santa Claus. \n\n1.

An Irish Life of \nSt. Ninian claimed that he founded a church in Leinster, and identified \nhim with the god Monenni. The Martyrology of Talsnacht said \nMonenni was another name for the pagan goddess Nenn, or Nynia, \ncognate with the Danes\' Nanna. 1 Thus "Ninian" seems to have been \na legend built around a pagan idol of indeterminate sex, worshipped in \nRoman-style temple. \n\n1.

Pre-Christian \nligions viewed the Goddess Nyx-Selene (Night-Moon) as the agent \ndeification after death, which made her a direct rival of the Christian \nyior figure. 2 Her nixies were abyssal angels who kept the souls of \ne dead in an underwater fairyland, in "pots turned upside down," after \ne manner of all Teutonic death-spirits. 3 In the Middle Ages, the \nater-fairies assumed the same characteristics as their close relatives, the \n\n\n\n729 \n\n\n\nNoah mermaids, sirens, wilis, and water-witches: that is, they lured hapless \nNorm sailors into the water and magically devoured their souls. \n1.

"Ma" was the \nWomb of Chaos, often personified as a cosmic fish; "Nu" or Noah \nwas the embryonic seed of life floating into a new birth. See Creation; \nFlood; Tiamat. The flood-heroes of India, Sumeria, and Babylonia \nalso rode out the deluge of birth-fluid in a moon-vessel called argha or \nark, carrying with them the pairs of all creatures to populate the new \ncreation. 1 From the same root came arc, a crescent; for the vessel of \ncreation was always identified with the moon. \n\nl.Jobes, 121. \n\n\n\nNorns \n\nThe female trinity of Fates as she/they appeared in Scandinavia: also \nknown as Weird Sisters, from Teutonic wyrd, "fate." The Prose Edda \ncalled them "three mysterious beings," High One, Just-As-High, and \nThird, who revealed the secrets of the universe and wrote the book of \ndestiny; hence their other title, Die Schreiberinnen, "women who \nwrite." More common names for the Norns were Urth (Earth), \nVerthandi, and Skuld, variously translated Fate, Being, and Necessi- \nty, or like the ancient Egyptian Goddess of past, present, and future, , \n"Become, Becoming, and Shall-Be." 1 \n\nThe original, single, eldest Norn was Mother Earth, Ertha, Urth, \nUrdr, etc., who represented Fate and the Word of creation. She was \nWurd in Old High German, Wyrd in Anglo-Saxon, Weird in English: \nShe/they lived in the cave at the source of the Fountain of Life, \nUrdarbrunnr, the cosmic womb under the root of the World Tree. She \nthey were older than the oldest "heavenly father" and had power \nover every god. ? \n\nThe death-Norn Skuld was a variant of Skadi, an eponymous \nmother of Scandinavia and a typical Destroyer. Norse poet-shamans \nwere servants of Skuld and called themselves skalds; Christians said the \nindulged in witchcraft, or "skulduggery." Skuld would lay the death- \ncurse on the whole universe at doomsday. Her name apparently gave \nrise to "scold," meaning a woman gifted with the power of cursing. \nLike the third of the Moirai, Skuld cut the thread of every life. \n\nThe Norns became "fairies" in romantic traditions of pagan \nballadry: \n\n\n\n730 \n\n\n\nAnd lo!

Numa probably never existed, \nbut "his" name recalls the Oriental custom of creating some of the \nGoddess\'s spouses by reversing the syllables of her own name, e.g., \nYa-ma, Lord of Death, a reversal of Ma-ya, Lady of Life. Ma-Nu was a \nGoddess of Creation in some of the oldest Indo-European traditions, \nand Nu-Ma seems to have been her male counterpart. \n\n\n\nNun \n\nEgyptian word for the primal ocean, origin of the Hebrew letter nun \nkneaning "fish"; it was also a sacred name, as in "Joshua son of Nun" \n|(Joshua 1:1). As applied to a religious woman, "nun" descended \nfrom nonne, a nurse, because in antiquity priestesses were practjtioners \npf the healing arts. \n\n\n\nvar. Nuit \n\n\n\ntian Great Mother personifying the night sky.

"Nymphs" served as priestesses \nin ancient temples of the Goddess, especially in sexual ceremonies, \nwhere they represented the divine principle of flowering fertility and \nwere sometimes known as Brides of God. See Virgin Birth. \n\nIn medieval times the word nymph was applied to either a witch 01 \na fairy, since both descended from the pre-Christian priestess. As \nspirits of nature, the "nymphs" were believed to embed their souls \nforever in certain parts of the natural world that the Goddess had \nruled in antiquity: there were water nymphs, tree nymphs, mountain \nnymphs, and nymphs who dwelt in the earth, the sea, or Fairyland. \nTheir ancient connection with sexuality was more or less consistently \nmaintained. Even now, "nymphomania" connotes sexual obsession, \nlike the moon-madness supposed to motivate the ancient nymphs in \ntheir seasons of mating. \n\n\n\nObelisk \n\nEgyptians knew the obelisk was intended to represent a giant phallus. \nIt was called the benben-stone, or begetter-stone, similar to the Petra, \n"the Rock that begat thee," as the Bible says. (See Peter, Saint.) \nUsually the obelisk was regarded as an erection of the earth god Geb in \nhis perpetual eagerness to mate with the Goddess of Heaven. 1 \n1.

Oceanus was often \nconfused with Neptune, Poseidon, Ouroboros, Taaut, or Python. \nOceanus was married to the primal Sea-goddess Tethys, or Thetis. \nHis name meant "He who belongs to the Swift Queen." * \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,27; 2, 402. \n\n\n\nOceanus \nOdin \n\n\n\nvar. Okeanos \n\n\n\nOdin \n\nNorse All-father, called God of the Hanged because the trees of his \nsacred grove at Uppsala were laden with hanged human sacrifices even \nas late as the 10th century. 1 Each victim\'s draumar (drama) recapitu- \nlated the death-rebirth of Odin himself, when he acquired his divine \npowers by giving himself up to immolation on the World Tree, \nwounded in the side with a spear. He said: "I know that I hung on the \nwindy tree for nine whole nights, wounded with the spear, dedicated \nto Odin, myself to myself." 2 \n\nThe occult significance of nine nights was pseudo-feminization for \nthe sake of creativity; it was the period sacred to women in childbirth. \nLatins called it the nundinum (nine-day). * Celts called it the nofnden \n(nine-night). On occasion the Goddess Macha inflicted a nine-night \nperiod of helplessness on men, which probably arose as a ceremonial \ncouvade whereby in primitive times the men tried to partake of \nwomen\'s powers. 4 The purpose of Odin\'s nine-night ordeal was to learn \nthe secret of the "wise blood" in the Earth-mother\'s uterine caul- \ndron, and to command the magic power of the runes, invented by his \nfeminine prototype Idun (Freya). After he traversed all the realms of \ndeath, he said, "I got a drink of the precious mead, I was sprinkled with \nOdrerir. Then I began to be fruitful and to be fertile, to grow and to \nprosper; one word sought another word from me." 5 \n\nBy his sacrifice Odin won for men the female secrets of the saga \n(speaking-woman, prophetess, priestess). He learned the runes, words \nof power, and sacred poetry, which his skalds called "the sea of Odin\'s \nbreast," meaning the blood he shed on the earth. 6 His myth evidently \npredated the discovery of fatherhood, for Erda or Urth was refreshed \nand fructified by his blood, not his semen. \n\nSometimes the tree of his martyrdom was represented by the Tau \ncross, also known as the Cross of St. Anthony or the Gibbet Cross. 7 \nAt other times, his gallows was door-shaped, with two upright tree \ntrunks and a crossbeam. This matched the poets\' description of \nOdin\'s gallows, Yggdrasil the "Terrible Horse," for the gallows was \nboth a tree and a horse on which men rode to the land of death. 8 The \n\n\n\n733 \n\n\n\nOdin same form of the horse-gallows appeared on the Tarot card of the \n\nHanged Man, whose number is twelve; he is the twelfth of the \n\nm ^^^ mi ^^ m ^^mm numbered Major Arcana or trump suit. Thus the Tarot Hanged Man \nrevealed Odin\'s secret of the Twelfth Rune, a mystery specifically \nmentioned in the Edda as a necromantic sign, with power to make a \nhanged man answer any question put to him. 9 This was one of the \nsources of the divinatory magic attributed to the pictures of the Tarot \ncards. It has been noted that the Hanged Man is a pagan figure, and \n"one of the clearest indications that the Tarot trumps were designed to \nillustrate some non-Christian system of belief." 10 The card of the \nHanged Man was followed by the card of Death, number 13, showing \nthat the victim like Odin was intended to traverse the nether worlds \nof the dead. \n\nScandinavian sacred kings were identified with Odin and suffered \nthe same kind of holy death, probably followed by apotheosis as was \nusual for sacrificial victims. Vikarr, legendary ancestor of the Vikings, \nwas killed by a spear-thrust from one of Odin\'s priests during such a \nceremony. Medieval Swedes periodically "reddened the earth with the \nblood of their lord," enacting the love-death of king and god. The \nblood Odin poured forth begot his reincarnation or son, Balder, the \nnorthern Adonis or Attis, whose consort had the same name as Attis\'s \nvirgin mother. She was Nanna or Nan, a Valkyrie name, probably \nderived from the archaic Middle-Eastern Moon-goddess Inanna. 11 \nBalder seems to have been the same dying-and-reborn god as Baal. \nBy the decree of his Heavenly Father, Balder too was slain and \nsent to the underground realm of the Goddess Hel. He was restored \nby the "tears of red gold" shed over him by Hel\'s celestial aspect, Freya; \nbut he would not return to this world. Balder\'s Second Coming \nwould take place in the next universe, after the destruction of the \ncurrent gods and the present world. He would rise again and establish \na new kingdom of more virtuous gods in another creation. 12 See \nDoomsday. \n\nPagan saviors like Odin-Balder were naturally regarded as demons \nby followers of their Christian rival. Therefore Odin became an \n"ogre" via his Lord-of-Death title Yggr, "Terrible One." n Medieval \nnecromancers were believed to use the things that belonged to Odin\'s \nrealm: gallows wood, gallows earth, parts of bodies of the hanged. At \nToulouse in 1335 a woman named Anne-Marie de Georgel was \naccused of witchcraft, on the charge of having used clothing, hair, nails, \nor fat of hanged criminals to make her magic ointments. 14 \n\nThough Odin was called All-father, he was not regarded as a \ncreator. Like his Greek counterpart Zeus, he was strictly limited in \npower. Both Odin and Zeus were helpless in the hands of the Fates wh \nwere Norns in Scandinavia and Moirai (Moerae) in Greece. "The \nancestresses of the Nornir were those beings who also gave rise to the \nGreek Moirai, the goddesses of Fate. According to Greek myth the \nMoirai were amongst the children of Night; and Night, as we know, was \n\n\n\n734 \n\n\n\n. \n\n\n\n3ne of the more ancient beings of Northern myth older at any rate Odor of Sanctity \n\n:han the viking god Odin." Nevertheless, Odin\'s worshippers eventually \n\ndivided him into a trinity named Twilight, Midnight, and Dawn, mm mm ^^^^^^^^ \n\n:opied from the trinitarian Mother Night to whom he was mated, just as \n\n:he Hindu Lord of Death became a trinity to mate with Triple Kali. 15 \n\nOdin was an Aryan god, descended from the Vedic lord of winds, \nvata, as shown by several other variations of his name: Voten, \nWuotan, Woden. 16 He was also Godan, in Hindu tradition a lord of \nvestern barbarians, consort of the Goddess Godiva whose name was \neally a redundant "Goddess-Goddess." \n\nAs a lord of winds, Odin was identified with the Prince of the \nPower of the Air, one of the titles of the Christian devil. Odin led the \nvVild Hunt, a nocturnal ceremony originally representing ghost-ridden \nitorm clouds galloping through the sky: another form of the Gray \nMorse that Odin rode. An English chronicle of 1 127 described the Wild \nHunt celebrated on the 6th of February by a group of black-clad \nlorsemen, riding black horses, following black hounds with "eyes like \nsaucers." Twenty or thirty men galloped through the woods between \nPeterborough and Stamford, "and all through the night the monks \nleard them sounding and winding their horns." 17 \n\nSometimes Odin appeared on earth as a one-eyed, gray-bearded \nbid wizard leaning on a staff, wearing either a hood or a broad- \nbrimmed witch-hat. 18 Odin\'s other common title was "the one-eyed \njjod," derived from several mythological sources including the an- \ncient metaphor for the penis. As a nonsexual explanation of the \ntnetaphor, one myth claimed that Odin gave up one of his eyes for \njhe privilege of drinking from the feminine Fount of Wisdom, called \neither Mimir (Mother of Memory) or Urdarbrunnr (Stream of Urd, \nLe., of the eldest Norn). Still another explanation for his acquisition of \nfeminine wisdom was that he stole the "wise blood" from the \npauldron Odrerir, which was in the keeping of the Earth-goddess in her \nacred uterine cave. 19 A similar story was told of the Aryan god Indra, \nvho stole the Great Mother\'s lunar blood Soma, and assumed the form \n!>f a bird to fly away with it to the home of the patriarchal gods.

This was \n\n\n\n735 \n\n\n\nOdor of Sanctity emphasized in legends of many saints\' relics, for example the remains \n\nof St. Mark allegedly discovered by some Venetian merchants in \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Alexandria during the 5th century. "When they lifted the stone from \nthe tomb, so strong a perfume spread throughout the city of Alexandria \nthat everybody wondered whence this sweet odor might come." \' \n\nAccording to the conventional phrase, every true saint died "in th \nodor of sanctity," for the sweet smell was taken as a symbolic \nassurance of undecaying immortality, tied to the church\'s doctrine of \nresurrection of the flesh. If a saint or martyr achieved heaven at once, \nas was the orthodox teaching, then his flesh could not decay and would \ntherefore smell as sweet as the airs of heaven, which were generally \nsupposed to be perfumed. \n\nThis was not an originally Christian notion. It was copied from \nEgyptian ritual and theory of mummification. A corpse must smell \nsweet in order to be accepted by the Egyptian deities; that was the \nreason for embalming mummies with sweet-smelling spices, resins, \nand aromatic oils. Anubis guarded the gates of the after-world and \nchecked each newcomer with his keen canine nose. If the scent was \nacceptable, Anubis declared the dead man reconciled to the gods by his \nOdor of Sanctity, and admitted him to the blessed realm. 2 \n\nThough the Christian Dark Age lost the art of mummification \nwhich was not to be revived until 20th-century embalmers improved \non it still the same spices were sometimes clumsily applied to dead \nbodies in an effort to preserve them. The precious virtue of frankin- \ncense was that it served as a key to heaven by counteracting "the ill \nsmells" of a corpse. 3 Churchmen claimed the bodies of those who \nwere excommunicated would not decompose, but they lacked the Odo \nof Sanctity that characterized saints. 4 \n\nThe perfume allegedly exuded by saints\' remains could work \nmiracles and cure diseases. The corpse of St. Stephen instantly \nhealed 70 sick men who smelled its odor when it was first exhumed. \nEarth from the grave of St. Dominic was said to smell sweet and \npossess miraculous powers. 5 \n\nAn effort was made to canonize the 1 3th-century inquisitor \nBernard de Caux with a legend of incorruptibility, because he was "a \npersecutor and hammer of heretics, a holy man . . . wonderful in extir- \npating heresy," Bernard Gui wrote. His body was exhumed 28 years \nafter his death and said to be perfectly fresh and sweet-smelling, except \nthat part of its nose was missing. 6 \n\nThe gypsies mocked Christian legends of nondecaying saints, \nclaiming that bodies which fail to undergo normal decomposition are \nnot holy spirits but vampires. 7 The church accepted stories about the \n"un-dead" but insisted on undecaying saints also. \n\nl.deVoragine,241. 2.

Oedipus killed his father/prede- ^^^^^^^^i \n\ncessor and married his mother/queen in the conventional way, but he \n\ncaused the Goddess\'s image (the Sphinx) to be thrown from a cliff and \n\nbroken. \n\nHis mother/queen was Jocasta or Iocaste, "Shining Moon," who \napparently called down the wrath of the Goddess on her consort. \nSome said he was banished from Thebes, others said he was slain by the \nGoddess\'s Furies in her sacred grove. 1 Most stories agree that he was \nblinded by a "clasp" taken from Jocasta\'s garment. \n\nJocasta\'s "clasp" may have been a euphemism for the castrating \nmoon-sickle. Herodotus said the women of Athens killed a man with \ntheir "clasps," but a new patriarchal law afterward forbade women to \nany such weapons. 2 Blindness was a common mythic symbol of \nastration, as shown by the tales of Samson, Odin, and Teiresias of \nThebes. In Egypt also, a penis was called an Eye; to cut it off was to \nput out the "light" of the One-Eyed God. ? \n\nThe allegedly incestuous marriage between Oedipus and his \nmother/queen was no more than the conventional alternation of \nsacred kings, each one chosen by the queen and declared the "son" or \nreincarnation of his slain predecessor. Oedipus\'s "father" bore the \nname of Laius, not a name at all but simply a title: "the king." As in an- \niquity every king was a god, so every queen was a Mother of God, \nmd the god\'s virgin bride as well. See Incest; Kingship. \n\n1 . Graves, G.M. 2, 10, 1 5, 396. 2. Herodotus, 303-4. 3.

(See Cannibalism.) \nAccording to the primitive tradition, worshippers were expected to \ntear apart the victim with bare hands and teeth, devouring him raw, as in \nthe earliest cults of Dionysus, Orpheus, Zagreus, and other gods torn \nto pieces in their myths. "The communicants rushed madly upon the \nsacrificial animal, tore it to pieces and ate it raw, believing that the \ngod was resident in the offering. ... It was believed that thus there took \nplace an identification with the god himself, together with a participa- \ntion in his substance and qualities." \' His immortality was eaten too \nboth in the omophagia and its descendant, the Christian sacrament of \ngod-eating though his body was no longer meat but a tiny fragment of \nbread. \n\n1. Angus, 129. \n\n\n\nOmphale \n\nLydian name of the Goddess of the Hub omphalos, the navel-stone \nmarking the center of the universal womb. Greek myth describes her as \na queen of Lydia, who enslaved Heracles and set him to work at her \nspinning wheel. Heracles was the sun, and he performed his twelve \nLabors on the spinning wheel of the zodiac. Each "labor" was really \none of the zodiacal houses through which the sun passed during \nHeracles\'s one-year servitude in Omphale\'s palace. This year marked \nbis reign as the Aeon. He wore the queen\'s robes, in memory of which \nthe priests of Heracles wore female garments and pretended to \ncommand feminine powers of magic. It was characteristic of transitional \n\n\n\n739 \n\n\n\nOmphalos periods between matriarchy and patriarchy that the king wore the \n\nqueen\'s robes when acting as her deputy. 1 \n\n^^^^^^^^^__ Omphale represented the Goddess as a consumer of sun-kings, \n\neach one annually killed and replaced by another who was born at the \nwinter solstice; like the archaic Roman Goddess Anna Perenna she was \na Mother of Time. 2 One of her consorts before Heracles was the oak- \ngod Tmolus, who fathered his own reincarnation, the sacred king \nTantalus, cermonially drowned at the Oschophoria to represent the \nsun sinking into the sea. ? Tmolus as a human victim was wreathed in \nthe oak garland of the god and tossed by a bull onto sharp stakes, \nindicating that the Goddess\'s bull-masked priests impaled him in a pit \nwhere his blood could fertilize the ground. \n\nThe divine Father of Heracles-the-Savior was the sun god Apollo, \nthought to have originated in Lydia although he later became one of \nthe most typically Greek of gods. In his earliest forms, Apollo was \nsubject to the rule of his sister-bride Artemis, the Moon, who was \nsometimes incarnate in a sacred navel-stone and therefore bore the title \nof Omphale. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 2, 167. 2. Herodotus, 5-6. 3. Graves, GM. 2, 29. \n\n\n\nOmphalos \n\nGreek transliteration of Latin umbilicus, the navel or hub of the \nworld, center of the Goddess\'s body, source of all things. As every \nancient nation regarded its own version of the Great Mother as the \ncosmic spirit, so its own capital or chief temple was located at the center \nof the earth, marked by the stone omphalos that concentrated the \nMother\'s essence. Hebrews called it the beth-elox "dwelling place of \ndeity." As a male god, incarnate in the king, this deity was always \nlocated at the Goddess\'s middle because he was her child. \n\nIn 710 B.C. a king of Susa said, "The Susian land, which is the first \nof the earth, is in the center of all mankind." Iranians said, "The \ncountry of Iran is better than all other places, for it is in the middle." \nChina called itself "the Middle Kingdom." So did Scandinavia, \nknown to its inhabitants as Middle-Earth (Midgard). Old Japanese \npoems called Japan the Middle Kingdom of Earth. Romans called \nthe sea at the center of their empire mare nostrum, "our sea," and gave \nit the name of Mediterranean, literally Middle-of-the-Earth. 1 \n\nRomans placed the world\'s navel or omphalos at the round hearth \nof the temple of Vesta. Greeks placed it at the omphalos of Delphi, \n"Temple of the Womb." Jews placed it at the temple of Zion. \nChristianity inherited a Jewish cosmogony wherein Jerusalem was \nregarded as the center of the earth, where Jesus died on the identical \nspot where the Tree of Life once grew in the primal garden. It was \nsaid a spear standing upright at the tomb of Christ would cast no shadow \nat midday, because it marked the center point of everything under \n\n\n\n740 \n\n\n\n|the sun. When Pope Urban preached the first crusade at Clermont, he Onuphris, Saint \n\ndeclared "infallibly" that "Jerusalem is the middle point of the Ophion \n\nHearth." 2 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nBy pre-Christian reckoning, this middle point was the Virgin Zion, \nfor the yonic temple of Mari-Anat. Feminine symbolism was preva- \nlent in all omphalic shrines, which generally represented the body of the \n; Goddess with the God present as a sexual partner a phallic serpent, \ntree, cross, or sacrificed male bleeding the Blood of Life. Even medieval \nromances spoke of the Palace of Love where God and Goddess \n(joined in medio mundi, at the center of the world. It was equipped with \njthe usual sexual symbols: a sacred spring in the garden, which also \ni contained the Tree of Life. 5 \n\nChristian theologians were amply supplied with the kind of hubris \n[that made men call their own home place the center of the earth, \ntheir own lifetimes the ultimate end of time, their own religion the only \n(permissible one, and their own selves the focal point of the cosmic \n|drama of good and evil. Indeed, the whole universe was viewed as a \nmere backdrop for man\'s probation. Peter Lombard said, "Just as \njman is made for the sake of God that is, that he may serve Him so \nthe universe is made for the sake of man that is, that it may serve \nhim; therefore is man placed at the middle point of the universe." 4 If \nman couldn\'t think of himself as somehow vitally connected with the \n\\omphalos, his world-view was threatened. Such a threat underlay the \nchurch\'s opposition to the discoveries of Galileo, which tended to \nprove that the earth was not the center of God\'s universe. \n\n1. Lethaby, 73. 2. White 1, 99. 3.

Macrobius said the secret name of Rome was Ops Consivia. \n\nSacred gem of the Opalia was the opal, representing the Goddess\': \nmany-colored veils. Because of its feminine connotation, Christians \ndeclared it an unlucky stone.

The further back one \ngoes the less possible it is to distinguish between the erotic and the \nsacral. And \'the further back\' means not only in time, but also into \nthe depths of experience." 2 \n\nOur "holiday" derives from the Holi festivals of the east, described \nby a pious western observer as a Saturnalia, featuring "the most \nlicentious debauchery." 3 The participants invariably saw their "de- \nbauchery" as a holy act, redolent of blessedness. Hindu texts said, \n"To have carnal intercourse with the goddess Parvati is a virtue which \ndestroys all sin." 4 The I Ching speaks of the mystical value of sexual \nintercourse, which "gives life to all things." 5 According to Iwan Bloch, \n"Religion shares with the sexual impulse the unceasing yearning, the \nsentiment of everlastingness, the mystic absorption into the depths of \nlife, the longing for the coalescence of individualities in an eternally \nblessed union." 6 For such reasons, words like passion, bliss, trance, \necstasy, glory were interchangeably applied to religious and sexual \nexperience. \n\nClassical paganism used sexual orgia to represent the central \nMystery, which is why Christian ascetics condemned the Great Rite \nas "the unnameable rites of the mysteries" or "the whoredoms of \nEleusis." The Goddess promised eternal life to those who "privily \nentered the bedchamber," meaning the pastos or bridal chamber where \nthe hieros gamos between the Goddess and her worshipper was \nconsummated. 7 The same sort of orgia took place among the northern \nbarbarians. Strabo said the druid enchanters in Ireland practiced \nsexual worship "similar to the orgies of Samothrace." 8 \n\nDespite the extreme asceticism of its early centuries, Christianity \ntoo became an orgiastic religion in some of its manifestations. An \n1 lth-century Christian community at Orleans met on certain nights of \nthe year to indulge in promiscuous behavior. A contemporary ac- \ncount said when the lights were put out, "every man grabs whatever \nwoman comes to hand, even though she may be his own mother, his \nsister, or a nun, without thought of sin; for such tumbling is regarded by \nthem as holiness and religion." 9 Defining such behavior as a manifes- \ntation of devil-worship was not very effective in preventing it, however. \nCommunal mating was a standard accompaniment to religious cere- \nmonies the world over, since before any Bibles were written. It was part \nof the surge of group feeling often characterizing the religious \nexperience. The medieval peasant had long been familiar with the \nphenomenon, and liked it well enough to cling to it even if it was \ncalled Satanism. 10 \n\nFew orgiasts deliberately viewed themselves as devil worshippers. \nAs a rule they thought themselves exceptionally holy. Rasputin\'s sect, \nthe "Men of God,"claimed their naked dances imitated those of the \nheavenly angels. After singing and dancing to induce an ecstatic state, \n\n\n\nOrgy \n\n\n\nIwan Bloch Author \nof The Sexual Life of \nOur Times; \ncontemporary of \nHavelock Ellis. \n\n\n\nStrabo Greek traveler, \ngeographer, and \nhistorian of the first \ncentury B.C., a follower \nof the Stoic faith. \n\n\n\n743 \n\n\n\nOriant they engaged in sexual orgies which sometimes resulted in the birth of \n\nOimazd children, all of whom were said to have been begotten by the Holy \n\n^^^^^^_ Ghost. 11 \n\nA Methodist preacher in Indiana once said, "Religious passion \nincludes all other passions: you cannot excite one without stirring up \nthe others." 12 American revivalism certainly proved this, so consistent!\' \nthat any child born nine months after a revivalist meeting was \ngenerally known as a "camp-meeting child." Outwardly puritanical, \nAmerican Protestantism nevertheless "revived" a mode of religious \nbehavior that would have been perfectly familiar to the ancient Greeks \nwith their Samothracian orgies and their lecherous satyrs. 15 It just \nwasn\'t called by its real name. \n\n1.

Jonas, 217. \n\n\n\nOrpheus \n\nOrphism was one of the most popular mystery-religions of the early \nChristian era. It was a development of the cult of Dionysus together \nwith Orpheus, his earthly prophet and savior-son. \n\nOrphism introduced a theology of redemption. It taught a doctrine of \noriginal sin. Man s nature was dualistic, composed of the titanic \nelements closely associated with the body, and the dionysiac elements \nwhich were allied with the soul. By an ascetic morality the former must \nbe repressed and the latter cultivated, to the end that the soul may escape \nfrom the body as from a tomb, and may cease to be subject to the weary \nkyklos genesios, "cycle of reincarnation. " "I have flown out of the \nsorrowful wheel, "says the Orphic initiate on the Compagno tablet. . . . \nOn the Dionysiac type of Greek religion it laid hold and remodelled it to \nits purpose. This Dionysiac religion, like Orphism, was of northern \nThracian provenance, and was fraught with orgiastic-mystic elements, on \nwhich Orphism fastened, adopting its emotionalism, its doctrine of \nEnthousiasmos, and of possession by the deity, rejecting its wild frenzy, \nand transforming its savage ritual into a sacramental religion. \' \n\nOrphism was a kind of western Buddhism, with escape from the \nkarmic wheel effected by ascetic contemplation, spiritual journeys of the \nastral-projection type, and elaborate revelations. "Orphism was \nsteeped in sacramentalism, which flooded the later Mysteries and flowed \ninto Christianity. Salvation was by sacrament, by initiatory rites, and \nby an esoteric doctrine. . . . Orphism was the most potent solvent ever \nintroduced into Greek religious life. . . . [T]he Orphics sowed the \nseeds of distrust toward the national and hereditary principle in religion, \nand made the salvation of the individual soul of first importance. In \nthis way Orphism had enormous influence upon the subsequent history \nof religion." 2 \n\nOrphism was the principal vehicle for Oriental mysticism in \nGreece. Its teachings were those of mystics everywhere: "Grasping in \nyour mind that nothing is impossible for you, consider yourself immortal \nand capable of understanding everything. . . . Ascend beyond all \nheight, descend beyond all depth. Gather into yourself the sensations of \ncreation, of fire and of water, of dryness and of humidity, imagining \nthat you are at one and the same moment everywhere, on earth, in the \nsea, in the heaven, that you have not yet been born, that you are \nbeyond death." Like an initiated yogi, the Orphic sage could repeat: "I \nrepresent things to myself, not by the sight of my eyes, but by the \n\n\n\n745 \n\n\n\nOrpheus spiritual energy I draw from the Powers. I am in heaven, in earth, in \n\nwater. I am in air, in animals, in plants, in the womb, before the \n^^_ ^ -- mam IMB womb, after the womb, everywhere." 3 \n\nAn Orphic funerary tablet dug up near Sybaris alluded to Buddha- \nlike escape from the karmic wheel (kyklos genesion, cycles of \nbecoming), essentially identical to the Oriental sangsara. \n\nAn Orphic sacramental bowl of gold, with carved figures, dating \nfrom the 5th century, was unearthed in Romania in 1837. The \nfigures showed the Orphic initiate\'s death-and-rebirth journey, the \ndeities to be met in the upper and nether worlds, who also appeared \nin person as masked temple personnel when the novice was led through \nthe stages of initiation. These figures were arranged on the bowl in \nthe same way as the deities of the Intermediate State, between death \nand rebirth, were arranged on mandalas of Tibetan holy books. 4 \n\nIn Orphic belief as in the Orient, the power behind all forces of \nmanifestation was the Great Mother, whose free-standing image \nappeared in the center of the Orphic bowl with other goddesses and \ngods ranged around her in the formation of a wheel. 5 She was the \nBlack Mother Night, from whom were born Sleep, Love, Dreams, the \nFates, Nemesis, Old Age, and Death. Even Zeus feared her, "which \nmay reflect an old belief in Night as one of the great primeval powers of \nthe universe." 6 \n\nMother Night was equated with Persephone, the "Destroyer" \nlinked with both Dionysus and Orpheus. Once initiated, the Orphic \nmystic could announce: "I have sunk beneath the bosom of Persepho- \nne, Queen of the Underworld." Upon his post-mortem descent into \nhell, Persephone would personally greet him and promise to make him \n"god instead of mortal." 7 \n\nThe Descent Into Hades was the title of the Orphic manual and \nthe essential rite of Orphic initiation, because the god himself \ndescended into hell and returned, bringing with him the revelation on \nwhich the Mysteries were founded. 8 According to the classic myth, \nOrpheus descended to retrieve his bride Eurydice, who had died after \nbeing bitten by a snake in the grass. This was a late revision of a \nprimitive Thracian dying-god myth, onto which the doctrines of Orph- \nism were grafted later. Eurydice was actually "Universal Dike," or \nTyche, Goddess of Fate, lady of the karmic wheel. She was originally \none of Demeter\'s matriarchal Furies, converted by Hellenic writers \ninto a daughter of Zeus. 9 In the underworld she was herself Persepho- \nne, the Death-goddess; and her "snake in the grass" was her own \ntotem. \n\nThe oldest Orphic myth said Orpheus was torn to pieces by the \nMaenads, who worshipped Dionysus, Orpheus\'s divine alter ego. \nMythographers gave various excuses for the Maenads\' act, designed to \nconceal the true sacrificial motive. Some said the Maenads killed \n\n\n\n746 \n\n\n\nDrpheus because he denounced their sexual orgies and advocated male Orpheus \n\nlomosexual love instead of the heterosexual kind. The Maenads \n\nyere so angry at Orpheus that in Macedonia they killed all their ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nlusbands for listening to his teachings. It has been suggested that \n\njatriarchal-ascetic ideas came to Orphism from Egyptian priests of Ra, \n\n>ecause Orphic priests wore Egyptian dress. 10 \n\nOther stories said Orpheus was killed not by the Maenads but by \nZeus\'s lightning bolt as punishment for his revelation of the gods\' \niecrets to mankind. After he descended into hell and returned, his \ndisembodied head was laid in a cave sacred to Dionysus, where it \ncontinued to sing and speak, like the head of Osiris at Abydos. As a \neacher of the mysteries of the after-life, Orpheus became a god of \njracles. He was said to have founded the oracles of Hecate in Aegina \nmd of Demeter Chthonia in Sparta, two examples of Hellenic \nsyncretism, as these oracles were formerly the property of the God- \ndesses whose names they bore. 11 Some derived Orpheus\'s name from \nJrphi, a popular oracular shrine in Edessa, though others linked his \nlame with Erebus, the land of the dead. 12 Aristotle insisted that \nDrpheus had never lived at all. 13 \n\nThe common legend said Orpheus was a famous poet and lyre- \n)layer, like Cinyras the ancestor of Adonis (Greek cinyra, "lyre," \n:ognate with Semitic kinnor, "lyre") and like David the ancestor of \nesus. Orpheus\'s lyre was kept as a holy relic in the temple at Lesbos, \nintouchable and taboo. Neanthus, son of the Tyrant of Lesbos, once \njlayed the Orphic lyre and shortly afterward was torn to pieces by a \n>ack of "dogs," which might have meant dog-masked Maenad-pries- \nesses. Later, the lyre was set in the stars, where it still appears as the \n:onstellation Lyra. 14 \n\nOne of the mysteriously significant phrases of Orphic initiation was \n\'I a kid have fallen into my mother\'s milk," possibly a reference to \nieath under Persephone\'s bosom followed by rebirth as her nursling. \n\\n ancient ritual was involved, one that was specifically forbidden by \newish laws: "Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother\'s milk" (Exodus \n3:19). So great was the Jews\' fear of this ceremony that they even \nnsisted on using different sets of dishes for milk and meat products. Yet \nheir god was once mated to Mother Asherah as the "Pit," like \n\'ersephone, in a sacred-marriage rite that included cooking a kid in its \nnother\'s milk. 15 No one now knows what the phrase meant to \njiblical writers. Certainly the prohibition was not motivated by kindness \no animals or reverence for goat-motherhood; there was a mystical \nreason for it. \n\nOrphism became one of the most serious rivals of Christianity in \n:he first few centuries a.d., until the church devised ways to identify \n:he Orphic savior with Christ. Fourth-century Christian art showed \nChrist in the guise of Orpheus, wearing a Phrygian cap, playing the \n\n\n\n747 \n\n\n\nOsculum Infame lyre, a sacrificial lamb under his foot. 16 Alexander Severus kept holy \n\nOsiris images of Christ and Orpheus side by side in his private chapel. 17 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ The Orphic Gospel was preached throughout the Mediterranear \n\nworld for at least twelve centuries. 18 It contributed much to Christian \ntheology, and even reappeared in medieval bardic romance. The poets \ntransformed Orpheus into Sir Orfeo, a king of England, son of King \nPluto and the Goddess Juno. Orfeo\'s wife was Heurodis (Eurydice). \nentered the underworld through a rocky cleft, and found the pagan \nfairyland of groves and gardens surrounding the queen\'s crystal palace, \nwith its pillars of gold and gems. The place was inhabited by "people \nsupposed to be dead, but they were not so." Orfeo returned to his \ncapital city, Winchester, which "used to be called Thrace" or so \nthe bard said. 19 So much for medieval notions of geography. \n\nOrphism gave Christian Europe more than muddled geography \nand romantic legends, however. The Orphic revelation was virtually \nindistinguishable from the Christian one, especially in its later "puri- \nfied" form among ascetics who abstained from meat and from sensual \npleasures in order to win eternal blessedness. With the introduction of \nsystem of post-mortem punishment, the resemblance to Christianity \nwas striking. Adeimantos, a character in Plato\'s Republic, said the \nOrphic revelation was "misused" by unscrupulous teachers, who \n"hold out the bribe of a happy immortality to the good and threaten \neternal punishment to the bad, so that men turn to goodness not for \nits own sake, but in fear." 20 The difficulty was not restricted to Orphisi \n(see Hell). \n\n1.

Scatological fantasies and excrement often figured in \nchurchmen\'s visions of the activities of witches. \n\n\n\nOsiris \n\nOf all savior-gods worshipped at the beginning of the Christian era, \nOsiris may have contributed more details to the evolving Christ figure \nthan any other. Already very old in Egypt, Osiris was identified with \n\n\n\n748 \n\n\n\niarly every other Egyptian god and was on the way to absorbing them Osiris \n\n||. He had well over 200 divine names. 1 He was called Lord of \n\n|ords, King of Kings, God of Gods. 2 He was the Resurrection and the ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nife, the Good Shepherd, Eternity and Everlastingness, the god who \n\njnade men and women to be born again." Budge says, "From first to \n\nst, Osiris was to the Egyptians the god-man who suffered, and died, \n\njid rose again, and reigned eternally in heaven. They believed that they \n\njould inherit eternal life, just as he had done." 5 \n\nAccording to Egyptian scriptures, "As truly as Osiris lives, so truly \ntall his follower live; as truly as Osiris is not dead he shall die no \n!ore; as truly as Osiris is not annihilated he shall not be annihilated." 4 \n\nOsiris\'s coming was announced by Three Wise Men: the three \nars Mintaka, Anilam, and Alnitak in the belt of Orion, which point \n;rectly to Osiris\'s star in the east, Sirius (Sothis), significator of his birth, \n\'ngelic voices hailed the coming of the Universal Lord on this \nxasion, which marked the rising of the Nile flood. Oriental paths of \nle Osirian "tradition may be traced in Tibet, where the rising of the \n.me star in the east marks the annual festival of "setting free the waters \n"springs," as the Egyptian festival set free the waters of the Nile, \n\'ibetans named the star Rishi-Agastya, after a holy king of "a very \njicient time." 5 Ancient Hebrews called the same star Ephraim, or \nle Star of Jacob. In Syrian, Arabian, and Persian astrology it was \nlessaeil the Messiah. 6 \n\nCertainly Osiris was a prototypical Messiah, as well as a devoured \nlost. His flesh was eaten in the form of communion cakes of wheat, \nfce "plant of Truth." Osiris was Truth, and those who ate him became \n[ruth also, each of them another Osiris, a Son of God, a "Light-god, \ndweller in the Light-god." Egyptians came to believe that no god \nKcept Osiris could bestow eternal life on mortals. 7 He alone was the \njavior, Un-nefer, the "Good One." Under this title he was even \nmonized as a Christian saint. 8 \n\nEgyptians were much afraid of death\'s corruption awaiting them \nithout the kindly intervention of Osiris: "When the soul hath \nsparted, a man seeth corruption, and the bones of his body crumble \nvay and become stinking things, and the members decay one after \nle other, the bones crumble into a helpless mass, and the flesh turneth \nito fetid liquid. Thus a man becometh a brother unto the decay \nhich cometh upon him, and he turneth into a myriad of worms, and \ne becometh nothing but worms, and an end is made of him, and he \nisheth in the sight of the god of day." 9 But Osiris could prevent all \nnastiness: \n\nHomage to thee, O my divine father Osiris, thou hast thy being with thy \nmembers. Thou didst not decay, thou didst not become worms, thou \ndidst not diminish, thou didst not become corruption, thou didst not \n\nputrefy, and thou didst not turn into worms I shall not decay, and I \n\nshall not rot, I shall not putrefy, I shall not turn into worms, and I shall not \n\n\n\n749 \n\n\n\nOsiris see corruption before the eye of the god Shu. I shall have my being, I \n\nshall have my being; I shall live, I shall live; I shall germinate, I shall \n\n^^^ germinate, I shall germinate; I shall wake up in peace; I shall not \n\nputrefy, my intestines shall not perish; I shall not surfer injury; mine eye j \nshall not decay; the form of my visage shall not disappear. . . . My body \nshall be stablished, and it shall neither fall into ruin nor be destroyed on I \nthis earth. 10 \n\nThe cult of Osiris contributed a number of ideas and phrases to \nthe Bible. The 23 rd Psalm copied an Egyptian text appealing to Osiris \nthe Good Shepherd to lead the deceased to the "green pastures" and \n"still waters" of the ne/er-ne/erland, to restore the soul to the body, an \nto give protection in the valley of the shadow of death (the Tuat). \nThe Lord\'s Prayer was prefigured by an Egyptian hymn to Osiris-Ame \nbeginning "O Amen, Amen, who art in heaven." 11 Amen was also \ninvoked at the end of every prayer. \n\nJesus\'s words, "Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and \ndie, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit" (John \n12:24), were taken from an Osirian doctrine that a dying man is like a \ncorn of wheat "which falls into the earth in order to draw from its \nbosom a new life." 12 Jesus\'s words, "In my Father\'s house are many \nmansions" (John 14:2) came from an Osirian text telling of numer- \nous Arits ("Mansions") in the blessed land of Father Osiris. 13 Stories \nabout Osiris turned up in Christian legends. Jesus\'s healing of a \nnobleman\'s daughter was based on a tale of an Osirian priest who curec \na princess. 14 Worshippers of Osiris were promised that they would \nrule the spirit-souls (angels) in heaven, foreshadowing St. Paul\'s promis \nto his followers that they would rule even angels (1 Corinthians 6:3). \nThe bishop\'s crozier was the Osirian shepherd-crook. The Christian \ncross itself was a variant of the Egyptian ankh, symbolizing "the Life \nto Come." 15 \n\nOne significant difference between Osiris and Christ was that \nOsiris was restored to life not by his divine father but by his divine \nmother who was also his bride, Isis. She put his dismembered body \nback together and raised him from the dead. She married him and \nconceived his reincarnation, the Divine Child Horus who became \nOsiris again. She also took him to heaven where he reigned as Father \nRa. Sometimes Ra was called Osiris\'s father, sometimes Osiris was \ncalled Ra\'s father, sometimes they were the same god, named Osiris- , \nRa. They were cyclically reincarnated as father-son and son-father, \ndwelling in the Mother as fetus, lover, corpse. 16 \n\nThus Osiris\'s cult centered on the theme of divine incest, apparen \nalso in a Christianity that declared the Father and Son identical, and \nthe Mother of God the same individual as God\'s bride. Osiris plainly \nexpressed the archetypal wish for union with the mother, found in all \nmen\'s religions. He was restored to life as the ithyphallic Min, Men, or \nMenu, "Moon-god," hailed as a Bull of lust, "the mummy with a \nlong member," or "the Lord Who impregnates his Mother." 17 \n\n\n\n750 \n\n\n\nA symbol of Osiris\'s sacred marriage was the menat, "moon- Osiris \n\nharm," in hieroglyphics a phallus-shaped jar pouring fluid into a \n\nvider pot or vase, signifying sexual intercourse with a deity. 18 The Haaa ^ MHH ^ HH \n\nmenat amulet was borne by nearly every Egyptian god; it was also a \njitle of Isis. 19 The same sexual image of the two vessels was found in the \n;ombs and temples of Babylon and Assyria. 20 The male water-jar \n\nresented the seminal spirit of the Savior in all the lands of the Middle \nplast and Egypt. In his processions, the god was preceded by a jar- \nbearer like the man with a jar of water who preceded Jesus in the \nPassover procession (Luke 22:10). \n\nThe Jews\' Passover meal called Seder may have descended from \nthe Egyptian Sed, the oldest festival of Osirian regeneration and \nfertility. 21 At the Sed, Osiris\'s masculinity was erected in the form of the \nDjed column, originally a simple phallic obelisk, later a representation \npf Osiris\'s sacrum, the "sacred bone" so called because it was once \nregarded as the source of seminal fluid. When Isis brought Osiris \npack to life, her first care was to make him "stand up," which meant \nrestoration of his phallic spirit. 22 \n\nPrimitive elements in Osirian myth show its extreme antiquity, \nBating back to Neolithic Egypt. Before re-conceiving Osiris, the \nGoddess apparently devoured him as she hovered over his corpse in the \nbuise of the archaic Vulture-mother (see Vulture). 2 * Like similar \nimages of devouring Kali, this points to an age predating even the \ndiscovery of fatherhood, when reincarnations were believed to be \nbrought about by cannibalism. Indeed, Osiris may have begun as one of \nthe numerous forms of Shiva, for his name came from Ausar or Asar, \nmeaning "the Asian" just like the Aesir or "Asian" gods of northern \nEurope. 24 \n\nAbout 4000 years ago, Osiris\'s cult was established at Abydos, \n|where he was called Osiris Khenti-Amenti, Lord of Death or Lord of \nme Westerners, meaning those who had "gone west" into death\'s \nsunset land. He was incarnate in a succession of sacred kings who \nseem to have served as sacrificial victims. Their bodies were divided up \nbnd distributed to different parts of the country to assist fertility as in \nNorway, up to the 9th century, where kings\' bodies used to be quartered \nand sent to the four provinces for burial, so each locality would have \nroyal flesh to assist the crops. 25 As Christian churches used to be \nfounded on spurious relics of apostles and saints, so Egyptian temples \nwere founded on bits of Osiris\'s body. 26 \n\nLike the head of Orpheus on Lesbos, the head of Osiris was \npreserved in the temple at Abydos to serve as an oracle, providing \n|much of the Egyptians\' detailed knowledge of the after-world. The \nshrine had a sacred well called Peq or Pega, the original home of the \nPega-nymphs who guarded the oracular well of Pirene in Corinth. 27 \nLike Christians seeking burial in consecrated ground by a church, \nwealthy Egyptians bought burial space near the Osirian temple, so as to \nshare the god\'s resurrection. Abydos therefore became the center of a \n\n\n\n751 \n\n\n\nOsiris great necropolis. 28 The faithful claimed on their epitaphs that "I have \n\nbecome a divine being by the side of the birthchamber of Osiris; I am \n^^^^^^^^^^^ brought forth with him, I renew my youth." 29 \n\nWhen human sacrifices were replaced by animals, Osiris obligingly \nincarnated himself in a variety of beasts, notably the Apis bull who \nascended to glory, carrying away the sins of all Egypt as he died in \natonement. 30 Osiris-Apis later became the composite deity Sarapis, \nmonotheistic god of Alexandria for six centuries. 31 \n\nThere were several Osirian trinities. One consisted of Osiris the \nfather, Isis the mother, and Horus the son. Another was Ra the father, \nOsiris the son on earth, and Horus the son rising in heaven. Another \nwas (1) Ptah, "Opener of the Way," a phallic consort of the Virgin and \nthe opener of her matrix; (2) Seker, representing the male spent, \ndead, and hidden within the female tomb-womb; and (3) Osiris, newly \nincarnate as the Min-phallus and standing for resurrection. 32 \n\nThe sacred lunar numbers seven, fourteen, and twenty-eight were \nprominent in Osiris\'s cult. The lunar cycle of twenty-eight days \ncorresponded to his descent into the underworld and ascent to heaven: \nfourteen days each way, or fourteen steps on his mystic Ladder. \nBuddha\'s ladder of descent to earth and return to heaven also had \nfourteen steps. 33 Like Buddha and Osiris, the Tibetan sage is still \nsupposed to pass fourteen days in the after-world before encountering \nenlightenment in the form of "the mandala of the animal-headed \ndeities," reminiscent of the Egyptian gods. Some of these deities were \nnamed Heruka, a possible cognate of Osiris the sun, Heru-Harakhti. 34 \n\nLike Hindu sacred dramas, the cycle of Osirian drama seems to \nhave been keyed to the menstrual cycle of the Goddess, incarnate in \nthe priestess who bore the title of Divine Mother. In the month of \nAthyr (Hathor), Egyptian women made clay phalli as images of Osiris \nand threw them into the Nile when it "turned to blood" in flood time \n(see Moses). 35 This custom recalled the Oriental conviction that the \nGoddess must be menstruating at the time of her sacred marriage to the \ndying god. Later accounts explained Osirian lunar numbers by saying \nhe was 28 years old at the time of his passion, or else that it took place in \nthe 28th year of his reign on earth. 36 \n\nAs Lord of Death, Osiris was sometimes identified with the Great \nSerpent of the underworld, and sometimes painted in the same \nserpentine form, bent around so his toes touched his head. 37 In \nPtolemaic times the whole underworld became Osiris\'s province, its \nseven halls collectively called the House of Osiris. 38 \n\nBetween 1450 and 1400 B.C. the Osirian mystery-cult took form, \nwith hundreds of verbal formulae for making the worshipper become \nan Osiris. He would be born of Isis and nursed by Nephthys. He would \nride across the sky "side by side with the gods of the stars." He would \nbe as virile as Osiris-Menu: "My palm tree (penis) standeth upright and \nis like Menu Therefore the Phallus of Ra, which is the head of \n\n\n\n752 \n\n\n\njsiris, shall not be swallowed up." When he was in heaven, the gods \njemselves would bring offerings to him. 59 \n\nThe Osirian Mysteries taught words of power for bringing about \n|ese desirable effects. Such words of power were "keys" to heaven, \n! be concealed from non-initiates as "a great mystery." 40 The Saite \niecension said with such keys, a soul could pass freely through the \nhtes, gatekeepers, guardians, heralds, inspectors, and other spirits of the \nl;avenly mansions, for he would know all their names. \n\nAnd the Majesty ofAnpu shall say unto me, "Knowest thou the name of \nthis door, and canst thou tell it? " ... And the Majesty of the god Anpu \nshall say unto me, "Knowest thou the name of the upper leaf, and the \nname of the lower leaf?" On receiving the proper answers, the Majesty \nof the god Anpu shall say, "Pass on, for thou hast knowledge, O Osiris. " 4I \n\nDuring the first century B.C. the Osirian religion was established \nii all parts of the Roman Empire. 42 Its popularity declined in the end \necause it became too complicated for the average mind. Necessary \nwords of power" developed into lengthy catechisms of divine names of \noorposts, lintels, bolts, panels, doorkeepers, spirits of the hour, \niiresholds, gods\' right and left feet, etc. Egyptians invented even a \nnemory-god to bring back the spells and holy names if they were \niolen by a spirit of forgetfulness. 43 The important ceremony of "Open- \nfig the Mouth" was performed to let the dead person speak charms \nnd words of power freely. 44 Still, the catechisms became too long and \njomplex to be remembered. \n\nBudge remarks that the Egyptians believed in "the resurrection of \nlie body in a changed and glorified form, which would live to all \nternity in the company of the spirits and souls of the righteous in a \ningdom ruled by a being who was of divine origin, but who had lived \npon the earth, and had suffered a cruel death at the hands of his \nInemies, and had risen from the dead, and had become the God and \n\ning of the world which is beyond the grave Although they believed \n\n,i all these things and proclaimed their belief with almost passionate \narnestness, they seem never to have freed themselves from a hankering \nfter amulets and talismans, and magical names, and words of power, \nnd seem to have trusted in these to save their souls and bodies, both liv- \nng and dead, with something of the same confidence which they \nilaced in the death and resurrection of Osiris. A matter for surprise is \nhat they seem to see nothing incongruous in such a mixture of magic \n[nd religion." 45 \n\nIt is a matter for even more surprise that a scholar of Budge\'s \n|tature failed to see exactly the same mixture of magic and religion in \nhristianity; for indeed he could have been talking about Christians as \n(veil as Egyptians. To this day, simple Christian folk still display the \nlame hankering after crucifixes and medals, agnus del, incantations, \nvocations of holy names and other formulae, saints\' relics, holy \n\n\n\nOsiris \n\n\n\nSaite Recension A \n\nportion of the \nEgyptian Book of the \nDead in vogue from \nthe XXVI dynasty to \nthe Ptolemaic period, \nca. 600-30 B.C. \n\n\n\n" \n\n\n\n753 \n\n\n\nOuroboros water, images, even rosaries which they copied from the Egyptians. \n\nOwl Christian formulae of exorcism, baptism, extreme unction, absolu- \n\n^^^^_^^^^^_ tion, etc., were words of power under different names. The notion of \nresurrection through identification with a resurrected god (by eating \nhis flesh) was in itself magical rather than religious and this was the \nbasis of the Christian salvation-idea no less than for that of Osiris\'s \nvotaries. Moreover it seems the concept of Christ was no less syncretic \nthan the concept of Osiris. If anything, the older god had more right \nto claim an original system of worship or of superstition, depending on \none\'s point of view. \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 2, 178. 2.

See Trinity. \n\nAccording the Christian legend, the owl was one of "three \ndisobedient sisters" who defied God and was transformed into a bird \nwho never looked at the sun. 3 It is easy enough to see in this idea the \nshape of the Goddess herself, and the church\'s hostility to her. One \nof the medieval names for the owl was "night hag"; it was said to be a \nwitch in bird form. 4 The owl is still associated with witches in the \nsymbols of Halloween. \n\nThe owl is also a bird of wisdom because it used to embody the \n\n\n\n754 \n\n\n\n/isdom of the Goddess.

If an owl could be slain and its heart pulled out and laid on \nne left breast of a sleeping woman, the woman would talk in her sleep \nnd reveal all her secrets. 5 This seems to have been a basis of the \nxpression, "heart-to-heart talk," which meant a woman\'s secret conver- \nation with her familiar. \n\n1.

"It has now been demonstrated that the hostility of the \npeasantry to Christianity gave the meaning of \'pagan\' to paganus. \nThis seems to date from the first half of the fourth century and it \ngradually becomes general in the second half." 1 \n\n"Heathen" came from Germanic heiden, that which is hidden, \nbecause the church officially forbade the rites of the old deities, and \nthe pagan people continued their rites in secret. 2 \n\nThrough the first half of the Christian era, paganism was overt and \nmore or less acceptable. Christianity and paganism existed side by \nside in uneasy proximity long enough for Christians to take over as \nmany pagan deities, holy places, customs, and holidays as possible. \nNoting that the people wouldn\'t accept Christianity unless it could be \nconsidered an extension of their paganism, Pope Gregory the Great \ndirected that Christian relics must be placed in the inner shrines of \npagan temples, and the people converted gradually to the idea that \ntheir deity was a saint instead of an un-Christian spirit. 3 Pagan feast days \nwere to be Christianized. For example, at Christmas the people were \nto be allowed to sacrifice and eat "a great number of oxen to the glory of \nGod, as they had formerly done to the Devil." 4 \n\nThough the old deities were re-defined as devils, nominal Chris- \ntians continued to believe in them as firmly as they believed in Christ, .1 \nif not more so. 5 They were quite willing to consult "devils" for guidance* \nin their daily lives. The Venerable Bede said Redwald, king of the \nEast Saxons, kept in the same temple an altar to offer sacrifices to Christ \nand another altar to offer sacrifices to "devils." 6 Gothic converts to \nthe church simply added the name of Christ to their own lists of native I \ngods but dropped it with equal readiness if its magic proved \nineffective. 7 \n\nThis dual religious system persisted even through periods when \nthe "fairy-religion" was persecuted as witchcraft. It could be said that \nChristianity and paganism co-exist even now, for the greater part of \nChristian worship, sacraments, and basic theology came from the \npagan heritage. "The lamb, the dragon (or serpent), the dove above the! \naltar, the triangle enclosing the all-seeing eye (common to Freema- \nsonry as well), the sacred fish-symbol, the ever-burning fire, or the \nimage of the risen sun upon the receptacle for the consecrated wafer \nin the Roman Mass, the architectural symbols and the orientation of \nchurch and cathedral, the cross itself, and even the colors and designs \nof the robes of priest and bishop and pope, are a few of the silent \nwitnesses of the survival in the modern Christian churches of the \nsymbolism of paganism." 8 Even such essential doctrines as the virgin \nbirth, Incarnation, Logos, resurrection, salvation, purgatory, baptism, \n\n\n\n758 \n\n\n\nnd holy communion were products of paganism, developed many Paganism \n\nenturies before the Christian era. \n\nGiraldus Cambrensis complained in the 1 2th century that the __^^^^^^^^_ \n\nI eople of Ireland were still given over to "old, barbaric and obscene \nI ustoms." 9 The cult of Diana co-existed with Christianity in Devon as \nlite as the 14th century, when the Goddess was worshipped in \n\n\'oodland shrines even by monks. 10 At Cologne in 1333, Petrarch saw \nIjwomen conjuring the Rhine" in what was described as "a rite of the \nI eople." 11 \n\nThe people\'s religion had been largely in the hands of women \n\' ince Caesar\'s day, and so it remained up to the 12th and 13 th \ni enturies when active persecution of "witches" began. 12 Martin of \ni iraga, a 6th-century Portuguese missionary father, noted that wom- \nIn not only maintained their own un-Christian temples, but also \ni erformed domestic acts of worship like decorating tables, wearing \nI iurels, taking omens, offering bread to water spirits and wine to the \nI [ule log, calling upon Minerva when spinning, and invoking Venus \nit weddings and on the public road. "What is that but worship of the \njevil?" he asked. Moreover, he believed in the women\'s pagan \nI pities himself. He said the rivers, springs, and woods were filled with \ni Lamias, Nymphs, and Dianas; "and they were all malign devils and \nlefarious spirits." 13 \n\nA 10th-century Penitential tried to forbid women to present their \nInildren to Mother Earth at the crossroads in their ancient manner, \nJior this is great paganism." 14 A 16th-century Finnish bishop observed \n[pat "when people fall ill, they seek help from the devil by laying wax \nI gures, candles, squirrel skins and other things on the altars, and on \nlertain days sacrifice sheep and coins." 15 The 9th-century Synod of \nhome recorded pagan worship in the churches: "Many people, mostly \niKomen, come to church on Sundays and holy days not to attend the \ni [lass but to dance, sing broad songs, and do other such pagan things." 16 \n\nOf course the churches had deliberately lured women by taking \n[wer the shrines of their Goddess, with the promise that the rites \njpuld continue as usual. Churches were built over shrines of Syrian \nllstarte at Corbridge in Northumberland, of Diana Nemetona at \nUath, and of Sarapis and Mithra at York. 17 At Cangas de Onis, \n[Lrrichinaga, and other places in Spain, churches were built around \nI agan dolmens and sacred mounds, still in existence today. 18 Church \nI recessions featured carnival mummers in the masks and costumes of \nIndent beast-gods, such as the four totems of the pagan sacred year \n\non, bull, eagle, and serpent adopted as symbols of the evange- \n[kts. 19 Pagan deities appeared in the very carvings and decorations of \n\nhurches. As late as 1 576 a British church employed workmen to pull \n\nown and destroy "sundry superstitious things tending to the mainte- \n\nance of idolatry." 20 \n\nThe Christian church had no holidays of its own; every feast in the \n\nchristian calendar was borrowed from the pagans, including Easter \n\n\n\n759 \n\n\n\nPaganism an d Christmas. Roman festivals were particularly tenacious, until they \n\nhad to be given Christian names to excuse the people\'s continued \n^^^^^m^^b^ celebration of them. The Hilaria became the Feast of Annunciation; i \nRobigalia became the Feast of St. Mark; the Quinquatrus became the \nFeast of St. Joseph; St. Cyprian\'s Day replaced the day of Jupiter. 21 \'7 \nthousand years ago, old and young assembled in woods or on plains \nto bring gifts to their gods, and celebrated with dances, games, and \nofferings the festival of spring, or of awaking and blooming Nature. \nThese celebrations have taken Christian names, but innumerable old \nheathen rites and customs are still to be found in them." 22 \n\nChristian historians often give an impression that Europe\'s barba \nians welcomed the new faith, which held out a hope of immortality \nand a more kindly ethic. The impression is false. The people didn\'t \nwillingly give up the faith of their ancestors, which they considered \nessential to proper functioning of the earth\'s cycles. They had their ov \nhope of immortality and their own ethic, in many ways a kinder ethic \nthan that of Christianity which was imposed on them by force. 25 \nJustinian obtained 70,000 conversions in Asia Minor by methods that \nwere so cruel that the subject populations eventually adopted Islam in \norder to rid themselves of the rigors of Christian rule. 24 \n\nAs a rule, heathen folk resisted Christianity as long as they could, \neven after their rulers had gone over to the new faith for its material \nrewards. Louis the Pious baptized a Danish chieftain named Harald \nKlak, and gave him a large fief on the Weser river, on the under- \nstanding that he would convert his people; but the people rejected bot \nChristianity and Harald. In the 10th century, King Haakon of \nNorway was fiercely opposed when he tried to institute Christianity. . \npeople rebelled, burned the new Christian churches, and forced \nHaakon to eat the horse-liver sacrifices and drink New Year toasts to \nWoden, Frey, Bragi, and the totemic clan. Some rulers themselves \nrejected the new faith out of hand. Alcuin announced in the 8th \ncentury that there would never be any hope of Christianizing the \nDanes. Their king was "harder than a stone and wilder than any beast \nand would have none of Rome\'s God. 25 \n\nCertain words reveal by their derivation some of the opposition \nmet by missionaries. The pagan Savoyards called Christians "idiots," \nhence cretin, "idiot," descended from Chretien, "Christian." Germai \npagans coined the term bigot, from bei Gott, an expression constantly \nused by the monks. 26 Christians were the first to insist that there was \nonly one god, and it was theirs. This attitude tended to produce \nresentment among worshippers of other gods. \n\nThe Roman Empire tolerated all religions within its far-flung \nborders, so long as Rome\'s official deities received due lip-service, \nand the deified emperors were properly honored. This policy of reli- \ngious freedom was soon abandoned by the Roman church, which \nbegan to insist that all non-Christian faiths be destroyed; then that eve \nChristians of non-orthodox sects must give up their heretical "errors," \n\n\n\n760 \n\n\n\ndie. The beginning of organized Christianity marked the true end of Paganism \n\ne ancient world\'s polytheistic freedom of worship. The new Gospels \n\n:came the sole authority. Other scriptures were burned. Yet, despite ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe destruction, there was no real end to paganism. 27 The people \nmembered it and practiced it throughout the Christian era. \n\nThe third Council of Constantinople decreed in the 7th century \nat the people must stop kindling bonfires and leaping over them on \nights of the new moon. 28 St. Eligius wrote: "Let no Christian place \n^hts at the temples, or the stones, or at fountains, or at trees, or \nlclosures, or at places where three ways meet. . . . Let no one presume \nmake lustrations, or to enchant herbs, or to make flocks pass through \nhollow tree or an aperture in the earth; for by doing so he seems to \nnsecrate them to the devil." 29 Nevertheless, these activities \nntinued. \n\nIn vain the Council of Toledo condemned "worshippers of \nlols, those who venerate stones, who kindle torches, who celebrate the \ntes of springs and trees . . . men who go about in the mask of a stag \nr bull-calf, who dress in the skin of a herd animal, or put on the heads \nf beasts." 50 At Ephesus, twelve centuries after the time of Christ, \nicient fertility rites were still performed though Christian writers \nsported that "men took delight in unholy things as if they were pious \n;eds." 51 To the pagans, they were pious deeds. \n\nSlavs never ceased to worship Kupala, the Water-mother Va-kul, \nbios the horse god, Yarilo the fertility-savior, and the rest of their \nantheon. Bulgarian penitential books tried again and again to abolish \norship of the sun and moon without success. As late as the 18th \njntury, the bishop of Voronezh denounced the "satanic games" \n)nnected with the sacrifice of Yarilo; and the Bulgarian monk \npiridon complained that most of his countrymen still worshipped \nyerun the thunder god instead of Jesus. 32 \n\nThe old customs were preserved especially by women, who were \nat welcome in the new church, and preferred paganism for the \n)iritual authority it could confer on them. A 10th-century Ecclesiastical \nanon appealed to fathers, not mothers, to instruct their children in \nChristian ways. Men must "forbid well-worshippings, necromancies and \nvinations; enchantments and man-worshippings, and all the other \nlin practices which are carried out with various spells. . . . And we \nijoin that every Christian man zealously accustom his children to \nChristianity and teach them the Paternoster and the Creed. And we \nljoin that on feast-days, they abstain from heathen songs and devil\'s \nimes." 33 \n\nBut the songs and games went on, gradually taking on the guise of \nicular carnivals, harvest-homes, May dances, Oktoberfests, Midsum- \nler feasts, and so on. Women maintained many of these traditions, not \n;cause they were more rebellious than men but because they were \nlore conservative. Priestesses came to be called "witches" by their \nChristian enemies. "Pagan folk practices and beliefs, whether Greco- \n\n\n\n\n\n\n761 \n\n\n\nPaganism Roman, Teutonic, or Celtic, did not die out with the introduction of \n\nChristianity but rather remained and constituted the fundamental \n\ni^^^^^^^^^^^ substratum of witchcraft." 34 \n\nAfter centuries of denunciation and suppression, the church fou \nthat many pagan ceremonies were too tenacious to be stamped out \nand had to be assimilated by the Christian system. At the end of the \n18th century, Irish clergymen "artfully yielded to the superstitions of \nthe natives, in order to gain and keep up an establishment, grafting \nChristianity on Pagan rites." Bourne said "The monks, in the dark \nunlearned ages of Popery, copied after the heathens, and dreamed \nthemselves into the like superstitions." 35 Sometimes Christ and the \nold gods were incongruously blended, as at a 1 5th-century temple at \nIstein dedicated to "Jupiter Christus." 36 To this day, the pagan \nceremony of the New Fire is enacted each Easter on Mount Lycabet- \ntus, where it used to commemorate the rebirth of Apollo. \n\nMany pagan deities were remade into saints. Others were vagu< \nChristianized by interpreting them as prophetic figures. "Aescula- \npius, who suffered death because he had raised the dead, is a type of \nChrist. . . . Jupiter, changed into a bull and carrying Europa on his \nback, also typifies Christ, the sacrificial ox who bore the burden of the \nsin of the world. Theseus who forsook Ariadne for Phaedra prefigures \nthe choice which Christ made between the Church and the Synagogu \nThetis who gave her son Achilles arms with which to triumph over \nHector, is no other than the Virgin Mary who gave a body to the Son \nGod." 37 \n\nWith a combination of syncretism, reinterpretation and exeges \nChristianity managed to absorb nearly all of paganism except its \nGoddess. According to Guignebert: \n\nWestern peoples in the early centuries of the Christian era never really \nunderstood the Christian dogmas, nor have they understood them \nsince. The religion which they have constructed upon these dogmas : \nthrough their own efforts was something different . . . it was cast in \nformulas ill able to contain it. The Western peoples have, strictly speakir \n\nnever been Christians Bearing the impress only of the Christian \n\nlegend and nourished upon formulas passively repeated, these men th \nvast majority of professed Christians remained actually pagans, and \\ \nstill do so within the folds of the Catholic commonwealth. }S \n\n1.

(See Palladium.) \nThere was some disagreement as to Pales\'s sex. Some said he was a \njriapic ass-headed fertility spirit like Set, or Pan; others said Pales was \ni female, one of the disguises of Vesta under the name of Diva Palatua \nthe Palatine Goddess). 1 The temple of this androgynous deity was \nhe origin of the word "palace." His/her festivals were celebrated \negularly, several centuries into the Christian era, by priests wearing \niss-faced masks.

Roman legend said Aeneas carried off the Palladium from the \nivreckage of Troy and founded Rome with its help. It was a symbol of \ni protean, androgynous deity usually called Pallas, whose name meant \nither "maiden" or "youth." 1 \n\nSome said Pallas was identical with the Goddess Athene. Some \n\n\n\n763 \n\n\n\nPalladius said Pallas was a Pan-like goat god slain by Athene. Some said Pallas \n\nPalm Tree was a giant. Some said Pallas was a wooden image of a female warrior. \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ Some said Pallas was a thunder-stone. A majority believed Pallas was \na phallic god and his Palladium was "the scepter of Priam, in the \nlikeness of a male sex organ." 2 \n\nIn Greek myth, Pallas had offspring, the Pallantids, who wor- \nshipped an Amazonian fighting Goddess, the enemy of the \npatriarchal Hellenic hero Theseus. 5 This may account for the notion \nthat Pallas was a female warrior, once a companion of Athene who \ntook her name and became Pallas Athene after accidentally killing her in \na mock battle. This classic myth bears the marks of revision, a story \ninvented to account for Athene\'s androgynous idol represented by a \nlingam-yoni, showing her union with Pallas, Pales, or Pan. \n\nThe Vestal Virgins were married to the spirit of Rome by means of \nan artificial phallus in the Palladian shrine; thus it seems probable that \nPallas was a sacred lingam signifying AMOR, the secret name of \nROMA in reverse. \n\nConstantine moved the Palladium to Constantinople and made it a \nsymbol of his own masculinity. It was buried under a huge red \nporphyry pillar topped by an image of himself in the guise of Apollo. 4 \n\n1. Graves, CM. 2, 403. 2. Graves, G.M. 2, 261, 266; Dumezil, 323, 583. \n3.

Palladius was \nassimilated to the Celtic pater, "Patrick," in a Christian legend that \nclaimed one Bishop Palladius was a missionary to the pagan Irish before \nSt. Patrick. 1 Both bishop and saint seem to have been purely \nimaginary (see Patrick, Saint). \n\n1. Encyc. Brit., "Patrick." \n\n\n\nPalm Tree \n\nIn the Babylonian myth of the primal garden, the palm tree was the \nTree of Life, a dwelling-place of the Goddess Astarte. The Hebrew \nversion of her name was Tamar, "Palm Tree." 1 \n\nHer male counterpart was Baal-Peor, or Phoenix, the god of \nPhoenicia whose name meant "Land of the Palm." As a phallic deity, \nBaal-Peor was symbolized by a palm tree between two large stones. \nSexual orgies in the temple celebrated his union with the Goddess in \nPhoenicia and in Israel until priests of Yahweh killed the celebrants in \nthe midst of their rites (Numbers 25:8). \n\nStill, the feminine connotations of the palm tree remained. The \nGoddess was often embodied in a Mother-palm, giving the food of \n\n\n\n764 \n\n\n\nlife in the form of coconut milk or dates. A complicated biblical myth \nshows Tamar the Palm-tree as the mother of a slain "firstborn of \nJudah"; and as a veiled sacred harlot decorated with the signet, staff, and \nbracelets of the nation of Judah; and as a widow (Crone) to whom \nofferings of goats were made; and as an idol "by the wayside," whom \npriests of Yahweh wanted to burn (Genesis 38). She gave birth to the \nrival twins Pharez and Zarah, Hebrew counterparts of Osiris and Set. \nThe spirit of the palm tree was still the Great Mother in the tradition \nof early Christians, who gave the title of Holy Palm (Ta-Mari) to the \nvirgin Mary. 2 Yet Egyptians continued to call a man\'s penis his \n"palm tree." 3 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 197. 2. Hughes, 55. 3. Book ofthe Dead, 518. \n\n\n\nPan \n\n\n\nPan \n\nKing of Arcadian satyrs, the horned and hoofed woodland god par \nexcellence. Pan was one of the oldest gods in Greece, associated with \nthe cult of Dionysus and sometimes identified with him. Pan was said \nto have coupled with all the Dionysian Maenads. In addition, he was \nmated to Athene, Penelope, Selene, and many archaic forms of the \nGreat Goddess. 1 \n\nGreeks claimed the Egyptian solar god Amon-Ra was the same as \nPan. They called Amon-Ra\'s holy city Panopolis, "City of Pan," \nsaying it was inhabited by "Pans and satyrs." The panoply (ceremonial \ndress and decoration) derives from holy processions in the City of \nPan. 2 Other words connected with Pan\'s cult are caper, caprice, and \ncapriccio, all from Latin caper, the goat. Pan\'s sacred drama of death \nand resurrection was the original "tragedy," from Greek tragoidos, \n"Goat Song." 3 The word "panic" was originally the terrible cry of \nPan, who dispersed his enemies with a magic yell that filled them with \nfear and took away all their strength. \n\nIt may be that Pan\'s legend began with the Hindu fertility god \nPancika, consort of one of the primal Mother-goddesses, many- \nbreasted Hariti, who suckled hundreds of pre- Vedic animal spirits as \nmany-breasted Diana suckled the woodland beasts, whose king Pan \nwas. 4 \n\nPan was an important model for medieval pagans\' Horned God, \nwhom the church called Satan. The devil always displayed Pan\'s \nattributes of goat-hoofs, horns, and unremitting lust; sometimes also a \ngoat head and an attendant throng of satyrs (demons). Yet the new \nromanticism of the 19th century laid aside the demonic nature attribut- \ned to Pan only a few centuries previously and made him a gentle \nimage of the lost Arcadia populated by shepherds and nymphs. Roman- \ntic poets adopted Pan as their wildwood god. \n\nIn 1821, Shelley wrote to his friend Thomas J. Hogg: "I am glad \nto hear that you do not neglect the rites of the true religion. Your \n\n\n\nPan\'s name has been \nderived from paein, \n"pasture"; it was also \nthe word for "all" and \nfor "bread," recalling \nvarious All-fathers who \nwere gods of divine \nbread, such as Osiris, \nAdonis, and Tam- \nmuz. Like them, Pan \nwas a sacred king \nwho died in fertilizing \nthe earth. The ritual \nphrase "Great Pan is \ndead" seems to have \nbeen taken from the \nrites of Tammuz; it \nwas also understood as \nThamus Pan-megas \nTethnece, "All-great \nTammuz is dead." \n\n\n\n765 \n\n\n\nPanacea letter awoke my sleeping devotion, and the same evening I ascended \n\nalone the high mountain behind my house, and suspended a garland, \n^^^^^^^^^ and raised a small turf-altar to the mountain-walking Pan." Oscar Wilde \nwrote wistfully: "O goat-foot god of Arcady! This modern world hath \nneed of thee!" 5 Byron wrote a regretful ode on the passing of Pan: \n\nThe Gods of old are silent on their shore \n\nSince the great Pan expired, and through the roar \n\nOf the Ionian waters broke a dread \n\nVoice which proclaimed "the mighty Pan is dead. " \n\nHow much died with him! false or true the dream \n\nWas beautiful which peopled every stream \n\nWith more than finny tenants, and adorned \n\nThe woods and waters with coy nymphs that scorned \n\nPursuing Deities, or in the embrace \n\nOf gods brought forth the high heroic race \n\nWhose names are on the hills and o \'er the seas. 6 \n\n1.

To this day, both Goddesses are invoked in the medical \nHippocratic Oath. 1 The two seem to have been personifications of the \nGreat Mother\'s breasts, source of the Milk of Kindness and the balm \nof healing. \n\nEgyptians said the remedy for almost every ill was "the milk of a \nwoman who has given birth to a child: such is the sweet perfume" \nthat could expel demons of sickness. 2 Panacea and Hygeia were \ncomparable to Egypt\'s Two Mistresses, Buto and Nekhbet, whose \nmilk bestowed divinity on pharaohs and health on everyone. 3 Buto was \nthe same nursing-mother Goddess called Latona, Lada, Leto or \nLeda, the Babylonians\' Allatu, the Arabs\' Al-Lat (who later became \nAllah). Etruscans called her Lat, mother of Latium and giver of \nmoon-milk. Latopolis, "Milk-City," was the Greek name for Buto\'s \noracular shrine, the oldest in Egypt. 4 \n\nMedieval Europe continued to believe in the curative virtues of \nmother\'s milk. It was said that any mother could cure her infant\'s sore i \neyes by squirting her milk into them. 5 Male doctors often recommended \nwoman-milk for the sick. \n\nIronically, one of the last superstitious believers in Panacea was \nPope Innocent VIII, author of the infamous bull Summis Desider- \nantes, which laid the legal foundations for persecution of witches and \ncaused the torture and death of millions of women.

A pagan might laugh at Apollo \ns a fable. A Christian would shudder at him as a malignant spirit." \' \nFirst of the demons in Pandemonium were the rival gods men- \noned in the Bible. To these were added the Celtic, Teutonic, and \naxon-Scandinavian deities; the deities of Greece and Asia Minor; and \nle Roman classical gods and goddesses. Specifically listed among the \nevils were Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, and Minerva. 2 Ruler of Pandemo- \nium was the underground god: Pluto, Hades, Zeus Chthonios, Saturn, \n.ucifer. \n\n1.

Lamusse, 143. \n\n\n\nandora \n\nAll-giver," title of the Earth-goddess Rhea, personified as the first \n\'Oman in an anti-feminist fable by Hesiod, who tried to blame war, \neath, disease, and all other ills on women. 1 \n\nPandora\'s vessel was not a box but a honey-vase, pithos, from \nhich she poured out blessings: a womb-symbol like the Cornucopia, \nnciently used as a vessel of death and rebirth. 2 Pandora\'s Vase became \nandora\'s Box only in the late medieval period, when Erasmus \nlistakenly translated pithos as pyxis} \n\nHesiod claimed Zeus sent Pandora to earth to punish men, who \nad offended him. She bore a vase filled not with blessings but with \nurses: strife, pain, death, sickness, and all other afflictions. Pandora in \n\n\n\n767 \n\n\n\nPangaea her curiosity opened the vase, as Zeus knew she would, and released \n\nParadise them among men. In a refinement of cruelty, Zeus also supplied \n\nmi ^ mm ^ m ^ a ^^ mm delusive Hope, to prevent men from killing themselves in despair and \nescaping the full meed of suffering their Heavenly Father intended for \nthem. 4 The basic theme is also familiar in the myth of Eve. \n\nHesiod\'s story was further adapted to the legend of King Solomon \nwho was said to keep a horde of demons in a vase. After his death, \ngreedy men broke the vase in seeking treasure and let the demons out \ninto the world. 5 \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1, 148. 2. Neumann, CM., 267. 3. Larousse, 93. \n4.

This animal was doubly canonized as the Lion of I \nSt. Mark, who replaced Venus as the city\'s patron and whose "relics" \noccupied the former Shrine of the Lion, now converted into St. \nMark\'s cathedral. \n\nBecause the character St. Pantaleone wore flowing trousers in the \neastern fashion, his costume came to be called "pantaloons," later \nshortened to "pants." \n\n1. Funk, 85-86. \n\n\n\nParadise \n\nThe Persian Pairidaeza (Paradise) was a magic garden surrounding \nthe holy mountain of the gods, where the Tree of Life bore the fruit of \nimmortality. Pairidaeza was also the divine Virgin who would give \nbirth to the future Redeemer: the Mahdi, or Messiah, or Savior, or \nDesired Knight of Saracenic Grail myths. Shi\'ite Arabs still look for \nthe coming of the Virgin Paradise, the next Holy Mother. 1 \n\nHebrew pardes, "garden," was derived from the same Virgin \nParadise. 2 In Solomon\'s Song the "enclosed garden" is the virgin \n\n\n\n768 \n\n\n\nmde whose fountain of life-giving fluid is not yet opened (Song of Paradise \n\nSolomon 4:12). A dual vision of paradise as a living garden and the \n\niving garden as a female body runs through all religious symbolism. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nLorenzo the Magnificent stated the same ancient theme in his \n\nlescription of heaven: "Nothing other than a pleasant garden, abundant \n\nvith all pleasing and delightful things, of trees, apples, flowers, vivid \n\nunning waters, song of birds, and in effect all the amenities dreamed of \n\n>y the heart of man; and by this one can affirm that Paradise was \n\nvhere there was a beautiful woman, for here was a copy of every \n\namenity and sweetness that a kind heart might desire." 3 \n\nThe psychological model of paradise was life\'s first experience of \nromforting love, the mother who warmed and fed the infant right \nIfter its terrifying birth trauma. Having "fallen" from the comfort of the \nbomb into a world of painful stimuli, if the child is not embraced and \nlulled into the illusion that the lost paradise has nearly been regained, \nne foundations for later neurosis will be laid." 4 Often the dweller in \nparadise was in a state of pseudo-infancy. When an Egyptian pharaoh \name to his two divine mothers in the after-world, "They draw their \n[reasts to his mouth, and never more do they wean him." 5 Egyptian \nunerary priestesses bared their breasts when escorting a dead man to \nlis tomb, probably as a magical promise of the nursing Goddess\'s tender \npre. 6 As further insurance, she was painted inside the sarcophagus \nd, reaching down with her arms to clasp the deceased against her bared \nreast, like a mother reaching for her baby. 7 \n\nPrimitive notions of paradise as land flowing with milk and honey \n/ere clearly representative of the mother\'s body in the earliest \nriemories. An elderly Kikuyu chief spoke of these memories, still vivid \nhis mind: \n\nShe was always there; I can remember the comforting feel of her body as \nshe carried me on her back and the smell of her skin in the hot sun. Ev- \nerything came from her. When I was hungry or thirsty she would swing \nme around to where I could reach her full breasts; now when I shut my \neyes I feel again with gratitude the sense of well-being that I had when I \nburied my head in their softness and drank the sweet milk that they \ngave. At night when there was no sun to warm me, her arms, her body, \ntook its place; and as I grew older and more interested in other things, \nfrom my safe place on her back I could watch without fear as I wanted and \nwhen sleep overcame me I had only to close my eyes. 8 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern culture made this paradise the birthright of every \nrimitive child a paradise lost. Dr. Henry pointed out that "No other \nulture has invented so many excuses for keeping a mother away \nrom her infant." 9 Wickler said a human baby is, like a monkey baby, by \nature "a mother-hugger and should be carried against the mother\'s \nody continuously in the early days of its life, as is still the custom \nmong primitive races today. The entire behavior repertory of the \nlewborn baby is adapted for this. ... It is not biological for us to place \n\n\n\n769 \n\n\n\nParadise our babies in cribs. Symptomatic of this is that the babies cry out of \n\nloneliness with abnormal frequency in our culture, while one scarcely \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ ever finds this among the children of primitive peoples." 10 \n\nPsychologists know the image of the lost mother is projected ontc \nthe sexual partner, which accounts for the extraordinary sexual \nsignificance attached to women\'s breasts. Erasmus Darwin noted that \nthe symbolism even goes beyond the breast per se: "When any object \nof vision is presented to us, which by its waving or spiral lines bears any \nsimilitude to the form of the female bosom ... we experience an \nattraction to embrace it with our arms, and to salute it with our lips, as \nwe did in our early infancy the bosom of our mother." " Man often \nsees himself in an infantile relationship to a woman who may be \nembraced and kissed that is, a wife or mistress. The Bengali poet \nChandidas addressed himself to a loved woman as if he were her infanl \n"I have taken refuge at your feet, my beloved. . . . You are to me as a \nparent to a helpless child." n \n\nA psychiatrist notes that most sexual fantasies of adult males "seei \nappropriate for a naive four-year-old, whose most important gratifica- \ntions primarily depend on mother. ... He shows unacknowledged sign \nof longing for her with the same fervor he did when she was all the \nworld to him, the holy center of his child\'s universe. His desire seems \nunmodified by his conscious perception and understanding of the \nrealities of life and the limited possibilities for gratification with his \nmother." 13 \n\nSimilarly, the desire to return to the perfect comfort of the womb \nin a post-mortem paradise seems unmodified by conscious recogni- \ntion of its improbability. Hidden prenatal memory surfaces in many \nreligious visions of the bliss of paradise, expressing a powerful wish \nthat what was lost at birth may be regained after death. To those traine< \nin interpretation of unconscious symbolism it is clear that the meta- \nphors of eternity represent a return to the womb. 14 When death is neai \nthe mind may even present vivid fantasies reminiscent of the mater- \nnal comfort that followed the birth trauma and soothed away the first \nexperiences of pain and fear. \n\nThus we find that the garden-paradise from which humanity "fell \nin the beginning was a genital symbol: garden, gate, grove, holy \nmount (mons veneris). This was suggested by the word Eden, meaning \nin Hebrew "a place of delight." 15 In the Middle Ages the usual \nmetaphor for paradise was the Garden of Delights, a term less charac- \nteristic of the Christian heaven than of the other paradise, Fairyland \nor Avalon, where sexuality was permitted. Christian tradition forbade \nsexual love and marriage in heaven (Matthew 22:30), but the pagan \ntradition continued to view paradise as the epitome of all sensual \ngratifications and the satisfaction of all sexual-romantic yearnings. \n\nChristians adopted the word paradise as a synonym for their own \nheaven, and insisted that the pagans\' paradise was really hell, with a \nfalse appearance of beauty to lure sinners. In rebellion against this \n\n\n\n770 \n\n\n\ntheory, bards openly expressed a preference for hell. Aucassin gives \nan example: \n\nFor into Paradise go none but such folk as I shall tell thee now: Thither go \nthese same old priests, and halt old wen and maimed, who all day and \nnight cower continually before the altars, and in the crypts; and such folk \nas wear old mantles and old tattered frocks, and naked folk and shoeless, \nand covered with sores, perishing of hunger and thirst, and of little ease. \nThese be they that go into Paradise; with them have I naught to do. \nBut into Hell would I fain go . . . thither pass the sweet ladies and \ncourteous that have two lovers, or three, and their lords also thereto. \nThither go the gold, and the silver, and cloth ofvair, and cloth ofgris, and \nharpers, and makers, and the prince of this world. With these I would \ngladly go, let me but have with me Nicolette, my sweetest lady. l6 \n\nOther ballads and early medieval romances rejected the Chris- \ntian paradise for its lack of feminine company. The Irish Fenians, whose \nrule was never to insult a woman, were said to have gone to hell for \ndenying Christian anti-feminist doctrines. The heathen sage Oisin \n(Ossian) rejected St. Patrick\'s heaven on the ground that it had no \nhunting, no bardic poetry, and no love of fair women. Oisin said he \nwould rather join the Fenians in hell. 17 \n\nMost people refused to believe that hell was identical with their \nbeloved Fairyland, Avalon, Cockaigne, Torelore, Valhalla, Isles of \nthe Blest, or whatever pagan paradise they professed; so it came to be \ncalled the earthly paradise, as opposed to the heavenly one. This \nrealm of the Fairy Queen was usually placed in the Far West. Revered \npopular heroes dwelt there: Oberon, Lancelot, Tristan, Arthur, \nOgier the Dane, and many others. 18 Since these heroes lived forever, \nthe Irish called their paradise Thierna na Oge, the country of eternal \nyouth. A wonderful fountain at its heart dispensed the Water of Life \nthat made old men young again. \n\nBelief in this ancient idea may have inspired the westward voyages \nof Leif Ericson, Columbus, and the legendary St. Brendan the \nVoyager, who was really a canonized form of the sea-god Bran, \ndiscoverer of the Cauldron of Regeneration. St. Brendan was said to \nhave discovered it too, on a magic isle in the west. But "St. Brendan\'s \nIsle" was never found. 19 Ponce de Leon went looking for it, and \nclaimed to have discovered the Fountain of Youth in Florida, which he \ncalled Bimini. 20 \n\nChurchmen also believed in this earthly paradise. St. Thomas \nAquinas was sure it existed and stated that Elijah and Esdras still lived \nthere. 21 The 13th-century Hereford Map showed it as a circular island \noff the coast of India, which Columbus thought he could reach by \nsailing west. Hugo de St. Victor said the island of paradise was "a spot in \nthe Orient productive of all kinds of woods and pomiferous trees. It \ncontains the Tree of Life: there is neither cold nor heat there, but \nperpetual equable temperature. It contains a fountain which flows \nforth in four rivers." A Danish hero was said to have reached it by \n\n\n\nParadise \n\n\n\nAucassin Hero of \nthe French medieval \nromantic poem \nAucassin et Nicolette, \nbased on the character \nof an earlier Arabic \nlover-hero, Al-Kasim. \n\n\n\n771 \n\n\n\nPariah traveling to India and entering the mouth of a dragon who guarded \n\nPartridge the bridge to the mystic island. 22 \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ m The bridge to paradise appeared in nearly all Indo-European \n\nmyths. It was sometimes a dragon or serpent, but most often a \nrainbow. Persians called it the Kinvad Bridge. Babylonians called it the \nNecklace of Ishtar. Norsemen called it Bifrost, or sometimes Brisin- \ngamen, the Necklace of Freya. Beyond it, the gods dwelt in Asgard or \nValhalla, in a castle called Gladsheim (Joyous Home). In Grail \nmyths, this was the Grail Castle on Mount Joy; in the Arthurian cycle, il \nwas Lancelot\'s fortress, Joyous Gard. The pagan paradises had many \n"mansions," like the paradise of Osiris which Jesus claimed for his own \ndeity (John 14:2). 23 \n\n1. Lederer, 181. 2. Hughes, 47. 3. Hughes, 99. 4. Fodor, 33. 5.

Athene was worshipped in Boeotia as Once, the Pear Pastos \n\nTree, mother of all pear trees. Perdix\'s name originally meant "the ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nLost One." He was a form of Vishnu-Narayana, called Lord of Pear \n\nTrees at his holy city of Badrinath in the Himalayas (from badri, \n\n"pear tree"). The pear tree had feminine-maternal significance through \n\nEurasia. It was also sacred to Hera, whose oldest image at the \n\nHeraeum in Mycenae was made of pear wood. 2 European peasants \n\nconsidered the pear a favorite "life-tree" for a girl.

Harrison, 344. \n\n\n\nBook of Leinster A \n\n1 2th-century Irish \ncodex containing \nstories and poems from \nthe pagan tradition. \n\n\n\nPatrick, Saint \n\nPatron saint of Ireland, probably a fictitious figure built on Roman \npater or patricius, a priest. The only evidence for the existence of a \nChristian St. Patrick was his own autobiography, supposedly written \nin the 5th century but not heard of until 400 years later. 1 Thus it seems \nthat Patrick\'s purported writings were forged by monks wishing to \npretend Ireland was Christianized earlier than it actually was. It is highly \nunlikely that the Irish were converted as early as the 5th century. In \nthe 12th century, St. Bernard complained that the Irish were still given \nover to "barbarous rites," Christianity having failed to take root \namong them. 2 \n\nLike many other saints evolved by 9th- and 10th-century hagiogra- \nphy, Patrick had pagan precedents. One was the Irish god of the \nshamrock, Trefuilngid Tre-eochair, "Triple Bearer of the Triple Key," \nwhose sacred plant bore all edible fruits including the apples of \nimmortality. He was a son-consort of the Triple Goddess whose triple \nyoni was represented by shamrock designs from the earliest civiliza- \ntions of the Indus valley. The story that St. Patrick explained the \nChristian trinity to the Irish by exhibiting the shamrock was entirely \napocryphal. The Irish worshipped the shamrock as a sign of their triple \npagan deities. The Book of Leinster said Patrick\'s mother was the \nGoddess Macha: she of the feminine trinity who gave birth to the \nshamrock-god. 3 \n\nMany other stories suggested Patrick\'s true paganism. He was \neducated by a druid. 4 In Wales he bore the title of Maenwyn, \nmeaning one dedicated to the moon. 5 The legend of his martyrdom \nindicated that he was sacrificed to the Moon-goddess, but like a pagan \ngod he was united with her Virgin incarnation, Brigit. The funerary \ntemple at Downpatrick was dedicated to both Brigit and Patricius. 6 \nThe Welsh form of the Triple Goddess, Guinevere, was said to have \nslain "the Irish knight Sir Patrice" with her magic apple, recalling the \nGoddess\'s gift of an apple of immortality to each of her doomed lovers. 7 \n\n\n\n774 \n\n\n\nWith all his pagan precedent, it is not surprising to find the Paul, Saint \n\nmonkish version of Patrick declaring himself "a sinner . . . despised \nby many." 8 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSt. Patrick\'s Day was known throughout the Roman empire as the \nday of apotheosis of the god slain during the Ides of March: Liber \nPater or Mars Pater, who would have been known as Patricius or \nPatrick in Britain. 9 At his Roman festival on March 1 7, a gigantic \nphallus was paraded through the streets, and solemnly crowned with a \ngarland representing the divine yoni, by the hands of a specially \nselected matron. 10 The phallus of Liber Pater was also known as the \nPalladium, planted in the womb-temple of Vesta. The priest who \nrepresented this god\'s power was the pater patrum, "father of fathers," \nor else the Peter (the phallic stone pillar), or else Palladius. An old \nchronicle mentioned a Roman-Irish martyr called Bishop Palladius, \n"the first bishop to the Irish who believe in Christ," sacrificed to the \nIrish Moon-goddess before Patrick appeared. 11 Evidently both Palladius \nand Patrick were the same pagan god, adopted into the canon after \nhis old shrines were taken over by Christians. 12 \n\n1.

Graves, W.G., 152. \n\n\n\n\'aul, Saint \n\nThe true founder of orthodox Christianity was Paul, who either \ncomposed or inspired the earliest identifiably Christian writings, predat- \ning the Gospels. 1 Paul laid down the basic orthodox doctrines: hope \nof high rank in heaven for the pure; avoidance of women and sexuality; \nseparation of body and soul. "For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, \nand the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the \nother" (Galatians 5:17). Paul copied the more ascetic Gnostic sects \nof his time, when "a gulf never completely to be closed again is opened: \nGod and world, God and nature, spirit and nature, become divorced, \nalien to each other, even contraries." 2 \n\nOne key to this process was separation of male and female \nprinciples in religion. Father Heaven and Mother Earth were no \nonger wedded. Women were no longer participants in sacred mysteries \naccording to Paul. The church must be entirely patriarchal; women \nwere forbidden to teach or preach in it. Paul also laid the guilt of original \nsin on woman alone, absolving man from responsibility: "Adam was \nnot deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression" \n(1 Timothy 2:1 1-14). \n\nPaul\'s antipathy toward women and sexuality leads to a suspicion \nthat his esoteric doctrine was linked with the early Christian practice \nof voluntary castration, recommended by Jesus for "the kingdom of \n\n\n\n775 \n\n\n\nPaul, Saint heaven\'s sake" (Matthew 1 9: 1 2). In Paul\'s day, Rome revered the \n\nself-castrated god Attis and Paul was an earnest admirer of Roman \n\nwm^^^mmi^^^^m culture, as shown by the fact that he Romanized his name, changing \nit from Saul to Paul. Roman Christians later used self-castration as an \nautomatic ticket to heaven, in the manner of Attis\'s priests. 3 Tertul- \nlian said the heavenly gates were always thrown open to eunuchs. 4 \nIn a secretive, elliptical style typical of contemporary mystical \nwritings, Paul suggested that he was among the divinely favored \neunuchs. He often mentioned, but never described, his mysterious \n"infirmity" which he called a "light affliction, which is but for a \nmoment" though it would bring him eternal glory (2 Corinthians 4:17\' \nIt assimilated him to Christ, and "They that are Christ\'s have \ncrucified the flesh with the affections and lusts" (Galatians 5:24). \n\nPaul hinted that he was one of the "new creatures" in Christ, \nneither circumcised nor uncircumcised. A man would have to be one c \nthe other, unless he altogether lacked a penis. Paul made an oblique \nreference to a mutilation: "I bear in my body the marks of the Lord \nJesus" (Galatians 6:17). He scorned the "natural" (unmutilated) man \nfor his lack of spirituality: "The natural man receiveth not the things of \nthe Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him" (1 Corinthians \n2:14). Nevertheless, Paul recognized that some men might prefer to \nremain natural. Although "it is good for a man not to touch a \nwoman," he proposed that such men be allowed to take wives, "to avoii \nfornication." Yet this was a grudging concession, given "by permis- \nsion, and not of commandment. For I would that all men were even as \nmyself" (1 Corinthians 7:1-7). \n\nPaul wrote to the Galatians: "I would they were even cut off whic! \ntrouble you" (Galatians 5:12). The word rendered "cut off" also \nmeant "castrated." 5 Paul said those who "bite and devour one anoth \ner" terms often applied to sexual behavior may be consumed. But \nthose who are in the Spirit "shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh" \n(Galatians 5:1 5-16). In his addresses to the Romans, Paul seemed to \noffer himself and some of his followers as examples of the virtue of \nsexlessness: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? . . . Our old \nman is crucified with him Jesus], that the body of sin might be \ndestroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead j \nfreed from sin. . . . Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that \nye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as \ninstruments of unrighteousness unto sin. . . . I speak after the manner \nof men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your \nmembers servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so \nnow yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. (Roman \n6:2-19) \n\nPaul spoke "after the manner of men," as if he were not one, \nbecause his hearers\' flesh had an "infirmity" that he didn\'t share. He \nasked them to crucify and destroy "our old man," a common Middle- \n\n\n\n776 \n\n\n\nEastern epithet for the phallus. "He that is dead is freed from sin" Paul, Saint \n\nbecause he could no longer serve the "uncleanness" of women. \n\nThe Jews would naturally have argued that sterility was a violation ^^^^^^^^^^ \nof divine law, since Yahweh\'s commandment was to be fruitful and \nmultiply. Paul insisted that this commandment was obsolete. God had \nchanged his mind. Paul declared that fruitfulness of the flesh now \nmeant death rather than life: \n\nFor when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins . . . did work in our \nmembers to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered \nfrom the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve \nin newness of spirit. . . . Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, \nwrought in me all manner of concupiscence. . . . Fori was alive without \nthe law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I \ndied. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be \ndeath. (Romans 7:4-10) \n\nPaul found the divine law of reproduction outdated and distaste- \nful because it brought forth "fruit unto death" i.e., more life doomed \nto die. Therefore he "died" from the carnal life and acquired new \nspirituality. "The carnal mind (or, minding of the flesh) is enmity \nagainst God ... so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. \n... For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit \ndo mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live" (Romans 8:7-1 3). \n\nPaul used the parable of the wild olive tree, whose branches must \nbe lopped off, to be grafted onto a fruitful tree. To those whose \n"branches" were lopped off for the kingdom of heaven\'s sake, he \npromised better replacements in the hereafter, for "God is able to \ngraff them in again. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is \nwild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature to a good olive \ntree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be \ngraffed onto their own olive tree?" (Romans 1 1:23-25). \n\nThis parable, Paul said, was an important "mystery" of which his \nfollowers must not be ignorant. He pleaded for cutting of the sinful \nbranch: "I beseech you therefore, brethren . . . that ye present your \nbodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your \nreasonable service" (Romans 12:1). Paul\'s "living sacrifice" may well \nhave been like those of Buddhist ascetics and Aztec holy men who \nhabitually practiced penile mutilations to win the favor of the gods. \n\nJohn the Baptist used arboreal symbolism like Paul\'s: "the ax is laid \nto the root of the trees" (Matthew 3:10). In pagan context, this \nmeant castration of the fertility king. The wild olive, "castrated" with a \ngolden sickle like the oracular oaks of Dodona, figured in the myths \nof Heracles and his Tyrian counterparts. 6 The genital blood of a \ncastrated king was the food of immortality, according to the Book of \nthe Dead; the soul of man was nourished on the food "shed upon the \nolive tree." 7 The olive branch was, and is, a sign of Peace; and \nPeace" meant the death of a phallic god, who received the Word of \nPeace at his departing. Here is a parable of which modern scholars \n\n\n\n777 \n\n\n\nPazuzu should not be ignorant. The lopped-off olive branch was carried in the \n\nPeacock oeak f the Dove, emblem of Aphrodite, who castrated sacred kings. 8 \n\n^^^^hm^^hh 1. Enslin, L.C.M, 233-38. 2. Jonas, 251. 3.

Great Mother Hsi Wang Mu ruled the \nmagic peach garden in the west, where the gods were reborn. 1 \n\nPeach Blossom meant a virgin in Taoist symbolism, while the fruit \nstood for a mature woman whose juices were essential to man\'s \nhealth. China\'s patron saint of longevity Shou Lou was an old man with \na high bulging forehead, bursting with "yin juice" he had absorbed \nand sent up to his head through sexual coupling with many women. To \nreveal his mystical secret, Shou Lou always held up a peach with one \nof his fingers stuck into its cleft. 2 \n\nChinese wizards made magic wands from peach twigs. These \nmight be compared to magic wands made in the west from other \nwoods sacred to the Goddess, such as witch hazel, witch-willow, apple \nboughs, or holly. 3 \n\nWestern writers sometimes confused the Oriental peach with the \napricot, because abricot was once a European word for the vulva. \nSculptures from the pagan period at Nimes showed examples of this \nfruit in conjunction with phalli. 4 \n\n1.

The peacock\'s iridescent \ntail-feather "eyes" symbolized the Goddess\'s watchfulness, her many- \ncolored veils, and her plumes of justice, against which the hearts of \n\n\n\n778 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[nen were weighed, as against the plumes of Maat in Egypt. The Pearly Gate \n\n>eacock belonged to Juno when she was still the Etruscan Goddess \n\nJni, the Great Yoni. It also belonged to the Hindu Goddesses Sarasvati ^^^^^^^^^^ \nmd Maya, and their Argive counterpart Hera. 1 \n\nJuno\'s priests and priestesses in their sacred processions carried tall \n>eacock-feather fans called flabelh. These articles were taken over by \nChristian popes and are still displayed at papal Easter services. They are \nlow said to represent "the many-eyed vigilance of the church." 2 \n\nBecause it was a matriarchal totem originally, the peacock tended \no attract the same opprobrium as black cats, opals, ladders, pentacles, \nnirrors, owls, and moonlight. Christian superstition generally viewed \nhe peacock as a bird of doom. St. James\'s Gazette reported in 1888: \n\'Nobody who has not gone exhaustively into the subject can have any \ndequate idea of the amount of general inconvenience diffused by a \n>eacock. Broken hearts, broken limbs, pecuniary reverses, and various \norms of infectious disease have all been traced to the presence of a \n>eacock." According to some legends, the peacock became a bad-luck \nird because it was the only one who consented to show Satan the \nvay to paradise an echo of the pagan belief that the peacock was \nuno\'s psychopomp. 5 \n\nIn the Orient, however, the peacock remained a Bird of Paradise, \n\'eacocks were encouraged to wander about the precincts of any \niindu temple and in the royal gardens. Like doves in western Europe, \neacocks were considered soul-birds and emblems of good fortune, \nometimes even oracles. \n\n1. Jobes, 224. 2. Brewster, 166. 3. Leland, 1 54. \n\n\n\n\'early Gate \n\nEntrance to heaven; a Christian borrowing from the cult of Aphrodite \nCarina, or the Sea-mother Mari, to whom pearls were sacred. Her own \n>ody was the Gate of Heaven, like the Jade Gate of the Chinese \noddess, through which all men passed at birth (outward) and again at \neath (inward). Various yonic symbols of the Goddess were said to be \nordered with pearls, including even the Celts\' sacred Cauldron of \nRegeneration. (See Cauldron.) \n\nWhen the Goddess appeared in the guise of the moon, she was \nailed Pearl of the Sea, or Pearl of Wisdom; her seven high \n>riestesses were the Seven Pillars of Wisdom (see Pleiades). As the \nnoon was the gate of paradise, so was the Goddess. Early Christian \nectaries copied the pagans in claiming that the souls of the dead \nmount up by the pillar of dawn to the sphere of the moon, and the \nnoon receives them incessantly from the first to the middle of the \nnonth, so that it waxes and gets full, and then it guides them to the \nun until the end of the month, and thus effects its waning in that it is \nightened of its burden." \' \n\n\n\n779 \n\n\n\nPegasus The pearly moon-gate like Mother Earth made no distinctions j \n\nbetween those who could be admitted and those who could not; as all \n\n^^ m ^^^^^ammm living things were her own children, so all dead things were her charg< \nalso. When Christian mythology supplied a gatekeeper in the form of \nSt. Peter, then the Pearly Gate became a barrier where a judgment w \nmade on the worthiness or unworthiness of the soul. \n\nThe ancients gave all pearls the feminine connotation, saying the \nwere made of two female powers, the moon and water. It was \nbelieved that pearls should be worn only at night, for moonlight woulc \nenhance their luster whereas sunlight would spoil them. 2 \n1. Jonas, 233. 2. de Lys, 284-85. \n\n\n\nPegasus \n\nWinged horse of Greek myth, symbol of the sacred king\'s or hero\'s \njourney to heaven; an image of death and apotheosis, like the mythic \ndeath-horses of northern Europe. 1 Pegasus had archaic, matriarchal \norigins. He sprang from the "wise blood" of the Moon-goddess Me- \ndusa, who embodied the principle oimedha, the Indo-European root \nword for female wisdom. Or, alternatively, he was the magic horse \nArion, "moon creature on high," born of the Goddess Demeter and \nridden by Heracles in his role of sacred king in Elis. There was an earl \nfemale Pegasus named Aganippe, "the Mare Who destroys merci- \nfully," actually a title of Demeter herself as the destroying lunar \nNight-Mare. 2 \n\nPegasus was named for the Pegae, water-priestesses who tended \nthe sacred spring of Pirene in Corinth. The cult seems to have been \nrooted in Egypt. The oldest shrine of Osiris at Abydos (ca. 2000 b.c.) \ncentered on on a sacred spring called Pega. 3 \n\nThe Greek Pegae preserved an ancient dying-god cult, as shown \nby the myth of Bellerophon, who mounted Pegasus and tried to ride \nto heaven "as though he were an immortal." He failed, and fell. \nBellerophon\'s predecessor (mythologized as his "father") also failed, \nand was devoured by wild man-eating mares. This was not meant to \nsuggest that human flesh ever became incorporated into an equine \ndiet. It meant rather that "the pre-Hellenic sacred king was torn in \npieces at the close of his reign by women disguised as mares." 4 \n\nPegasus represented divine inspiration as well as godlike apotheo \n\nsis. A man who rode him could become a great poet. Pegasus\'s \n\ncrescent-moon-shaped hoof stamped the ground and dug the Hippo- \n\ncrene (Horse- Well), a spring of poetic inspiration on Mount Helicon, \n\nthe home of the Muses. This was another kind of immortality; the rid< \n\nof Pegasus could figuratively "fly through the air, to reach the \n\nheavens." 5 \n\n1. Eliade, S., 467. 2. Graves, CM. 1, 239, 255; W.G., 425. 3.

Pelican \n\nth century a.d.) Pelagia the Penitent, Pelagia of Antioch, Pelagia of MMMMMni \narsus, et al. All were fictions built on the epithet of Aphrodite \nelagia, "Sea." They were identified also with St. Margaret or St. \nlarina, other "pelagic" titles of the same Goddess. \n\nSometimes Pelagia was a beautiful dancing girl, converted by a \nChristian preacher and made to repent. Sometimes she was a \neautiful virgin who threw herself from a housetop to avoid losing her \nirginity. Sometimes she was a beautiful Christian maiden who \nxirned a royal lover, the son of Diocletian (or, in some versions, the \nmperor himself), and for this she was roasted to death in a brazen \null. 1 The stories apparently were inspired by statues of the Goddess \nibeled "Pelagia," and some of the methods of destroying them. \n\nAnother legend showed Pelagia differently, as a temptress trying to \narrupt a male saint. He was St. Hilary, who wandered into a remote \nJpine village when the people were celebrating pagan rites of Midsum- \nler under the guidance of their chatelaine, Lady Pelagia. She \n\'elcomed the holy man to her palace and asked him many deep \nuestions. When she asked, "What is the distance from heaven to \nell?," a heavenly voice commanded St. Hilary to breathe on her in the \name of Christ. He did so, and she suddenly turned into a statue of \nphrodite. In the morning the statue fell to pieces, and the magic palace \nas revealed as a ruin of an old Roman city. 2 \n\nThe same riddle was asked again in the legend of St. Andrew, who \nxplained that only Satan could know the distance from heaven to \nell because he had measured it in his fall. 3 \n\nAnother legend of Pelagia repeated the same tale told of many \nther fictitious she-saints, namely that she disguised herself as a man \nid spent some time living in a community of monks, under the name \nf Pelagius. 4 This may have been connected with the early apocry- \nhal Gospels that forbade women to be Christians unless they "made \nlemselves male." 5 \n\n1.

The legend probably \nrose from the pelican\'s habit of resting with its bill sunk in its breast \nathers. \n\n\n\n781 \n\n\n\nPenates \nPentacle \n\n\n\nSt. Augustine accepted this ancient fantasy of the mother pelican>j \nas fact, and so did subsequent churchmen, for no one dared contra- \ndict Augustine even though no pelican had ever been seen opening j \nown breast. 1 The self-sacrificing mother pelican became a popular \nmotif on both ecclesiastical and secular coats of arms. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 179. \n\n\n\nPenates \n\nRoman household gods who protected the penus, a grain-storage \nchamber, once associated with the family tomb.

She was once an orgiastic \nfertility-mother, as shown by the legend that she took all her "suitors" \ninto her bed, and she was both the mother and the consort of Pan. 1 \n\nHer function in the Odyssey was to account for Odysseus\'s \ncharmed life. As long as Penelope refrained from cutting her thread, \nOdysseus couldn\'t die. So he survived many dangerous adventures \nwhile she wove and unwove the tapestry of his life, never cutting it \noff. He even overcame the death-curse cast on him by Hecuba. 2 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 392. 2.

In Egypt the five-pointed \nstar represented the underground womb. 5 \n\nUse of the pentacle as an amulet of protection or healing was \ncommon in Babylon, where it was often drawn on pots to preserve \ntheir contents. The amulet known as The Seven Seals shows a pentack \nas the first of its holy signs. According to Judeo-Christian tradition, \nthe Seals were supposed to represent the secret names of God, and \nthe pentacle was the chief of them, inscribed on King Solomon\'s \n\n\n\n782 \n\n\n\nmagic ring. 4 Thus it was sometimes erroneously called Solomon\'s Seal. Penthesileia \n\nHowever, it was more closely connected with pagan deities than \nwith the Jewish one. A pentacle with one point straight down __. \n\nrepresented the Horned God, whom Neoplatonic philosophers called \nPentamorph, "He of the Five Shapes." 5 He appeared in human \nform as well as the four horned animals, bull, ram, goat, and stag. \n\nPagan Celts like the Egyptians revered the pentacle as a sign of the \nunderground Goddess, whom they called Morgan. In her honor, the \nsolar hero Gawain carried a pentacle on his blood-red shield. 6 \n\nHermetic magicians used the pentacle for their model of Man the \nMicrocosm. A male figure was placed inside a circle representing the \ncosmos: his feet, hands, and head touched the circle at the points \ndesignated by the inscribed pentacle, his genitals being located exactly \nin its center. 7 This image was related to Firmicus Maternus\'s remark \nthat man is a microcosm ruled by "the five stars." 8 \n\nLike other figures constructed of a single unbroken line, the \npentacle was believed to afford protection from spirits, who needed \nthe "gates" formed by a broken line. Therefore the pentacle was often \nused to mark off magical enclosures, especially for invocation. Medi- \neval churchmen consequently took to calling it by such names as Devil\'s \nSign, Witch\'s Cross, Wizard\'s Star, Goblin\'s Cross, or Witch\'s \nFoot. 9 It was thought that a vampire or werewolf would show a pentacle \non the foot sole or palm of the hand. This notion may be compared \nwith the five-petaled Lotus that appeared on the hands of Buddha. 10 \n\nContinuous appearances of the pentacle in magic books probably \ninfluenced Slavic witches who tried to cure diseases by "measuring \nthe pentacle" on the patient. A string was stretched from feet to chin, \nfrom the middle finger of each hand to the other, from each hand to \nthe opposite foot, while the sufferer stood in the position of Microcos- \nmic Man. "Differences in measurement give diagnosis and \nprognosis, and cutting the twine with a knife after each measurement \ncuts away the sickness. The bits of twine are burned so that the \npatient may inhale the fumes, and the ashes are placed in fresh water, of \nwhich the patient drinks a portion." u \n\nMagic charms using the pentacle are still extant. Gypsies still cut \nthe apple to reveal the Kore, the Pentacle of the Virgin, which they \ncall Star of Knowledge. 12 \n\nl.Hornung,212. 2. Pepper & Wilcock, 23. 3. Budge, E.L.,75. 4.

Various sources agree that when she was dead, Achilles raped \n\n\n\n783 \n\n\n\nPerceval \n\n\n\nher corpse. Some stories say her eyes were gouged out and she was \ndragged by one foot and thrown into a river. Others say she was taken \nup respectfully and buried with honor as a great heroine. 1 \nl.Graves,G.M.2,3B. \n\n\n\nRoman de Perceval \n\nAlternate name for the \nConte del Graal \nwritten by Chretien de \nTroyes about 1185, \nfinished later \nby other hands. \n\n\n\nPerceval \n\nAlso known as Parsifal, Percival, Persevelle, and other variations, this \nprotean hero of medieval romance united many myths both pagan and \nChristian. \n\nHe was first manifested as the Welsh ithyphallic demigod Peredur \nPaladrhir, whose name meant "Spearman with a Long Shaft," \ncarrying the same sexual implication as Osiris\'s title, "Mummy with a \nLong Member." \' His later name, Perceval, also meant a phallus, \nliterally "He Who Pierces (or penetrates) the Valley." 2 \n\nThe original myth of Peredur was an allegory of druidic initiation. \nHis adventures were staged as secret examinations, and he had to take \nan oath not to speak a single word to any Christian a detail that surely \nindicates pagan Mysteries. Peredur passed 21 days in the castle of the \nwitches of Caer Loyw to receive his instruction. In the women\'s "great \ncourt" he saw the Cauldron of Regeneration performing resurrec- \ntions of the Sons of the King of Suffering, near a sacred cave with a \nphallic pillar at its entrance. A man was killed each day. The women \nanointed the corpse and bathed it in the magic cauldron, and the man\'s \nlife was restored. Two sisters resembling the Gospels\' Mary and \nMartha gave Peredur bread and wine to serve the banquet table. This \nscene was not a copy of the Christian Last Supper; it came from older \nsources. It presaged primitive rites of the death and rebirth of the \nvegetation god, for whom the women wailed and in whose absence \nthe earth became a Waste Land.\' \n\nPeredur\'s chief instructress was his lady-love, "the most beautiful \ndamsel in the world," whose colors were those of the Triple Goddess \nin India: virgin white, maternal red, and the black of death. These \nremained the colors of the Maiden in many romances and fairy tales, \nsuch as "Snow White." (See Gunas.) The colors alone put Peredur \ninto a "trance of meditation" on his mysterious Shakti, for that was \nwhat she was. On saying farewell, she told him: "When thou seekest for \nme, seek in the direction of India." 4 \n\nSimilar instruction at the hands of a Shakti figured in the 12th- \ncentury Roman de Perceval, where the Welsh hero metamorphosed \ninto the Desired Knight sent to cure the world\'s ills, like a Saracen \nMahdi. It was claimed that Perceval would heal the lame Fisher King \nand restore the Waste Land to fertility. \n\nPerceval was hidden, like most versions of the Divine Child, and \nbrought up in secret by his mother. He happened to meet some \nknights, assumed they were angels, and followed them to King Arthur\'s \n\n\n\n784 \n\n\n\n:ourt. Despite his appearance as a clownish rustic, a lady prophesied Perceval \n\ni great destiny for him. ("Ladies" were the court seeresses.) Perceval \n\nisited the Grail castle and saw a vision of the holy vessel in the hands ^^^^^ \n\n|>f Queen Repanse de Joie (Dispenser of Joy). \n\nPerceval\'s instructress Blancheflor (White Flower) undertook to \neveal to him the secret meanings of chivalry, or the mysticism of \niove. Spiritual/sexual union with her made him invincible in battle, \nhowever, German versions of the legend recounted a battle between \nhe old pagan Perceval sustained by the power of sexual love and a new \nChristian Perceval sustained by celibacy. 5 Monkish authors worked \n>n the unfinished Roman de Perceval from before 1200 a.d. to about \n230, Christianizing the hero, who then discovered that the true \nneaning of chivalry was not what his lady-love taught at all but rather \nhe doctrines of the church. Blancheflor fell on hard times, mythically \nipeaking. She was vilified as "a Jewess named Blanchefleure" who \ntoupled with Satan at a witches\' sabbat and gave birth to Antichrist. 6 \n\nThe new Perceval was no longer a champion of women. He even \ntastrated himself in order to become one of the pure knights who \n\'believed in God perfectly." On one occasion he offered assistance to a \nlagan noblewoman whose property had been stolen. She served him \n. feast and invited him into her bed. Though sorely tempted, he caught \night of the cross formed by his sword hilt and thrust away the \n:nchantress. She vanished in a puff of black smoke. Perceval "rove \nkimself through the thigh" a classic metaphor for castration \naying, "Sithen my flesh will be my master I shall punish it. ... O good \n_,ord, take this in recompensation of that which I have done against \nhee. " 7 \n\nIn this way the phallic hero called Piercer of the Valley became the \nburest of pure knights, the only one worthy to see the Holy Grail \ntecause all other knights were polluted by love affairs or marriage. In \nPerceval\'s vision, "the old law" was represented as a woman riding a \nerpent, who a priest told him was a fiend. The woman asked Perceval \nb serve her, as the priest said, "to make thee believe on her and leave \npy baptism." Perceval refused. He made the sign of the cross and killed \n(he serpent. 8 \n\nIn a Cistercian romance, Perceval met the Queen of the Waste \njand, his aunt, living in poverty in the Waste Forest, though she had \n>nce been "the richest woman in the world." This indicates the \nikxldess, her temples robbed, and only her woodland groves left to \nler. Another female relative, Perceval\'s sister, arrived dead on Solo- \nnon\'s ship, the symbol of the church. She was nobly enshrined \n>ecause she had died a pure virgin, the monks\' notion of the only \nicceptable kind of woman. \n\nThere were no women involved in the Quest, any more than there \nvere women involved in setting policies for the church. 9 In this final \n\'ersion of the Grail myth, its feminine meaning had been written out of \nhe script, even though it was a prize sought by men. With this \n\n\n\n785 \n\n\n\nPen development, interest in the subject declined. Grail legends dwindled \n\nPersephone away for lack of further inspiration. The Christianized, virginized \n\nmm ^ t ^^^^^^^ mm Perceval seemed to lack charisma. He was a hero who pleased only th< \nmonks who invented him; ordinary folk found it difficult to sympa- \nthize with this singularly bloodless knight. \n\n1. Squire, 369. 2. Jung & von Franz, 185. 3.

The three deities succeeded each other \ncyclically like the three points of a turning triangle Demeter\'s symbol \nthe delta so that Kore and Persephone were often confused and \ncame to be considered the same Goddess. The fable about Kore- \nPersephone\'s abduction by Pluto was a later invention. She was \nQueen of the Underworld long before there was a masculinized Pluto. \nOrphic mystics worshipped her as Goddess of the blessed dead, to \nwhom they addressed formula prayers: "And now I come a suppliant t( \nthe Holy Persephone, that of her grace she receive me to the seats of \nthe Hallowed." Persephone answered, "Happy and blessed one, thou \nshalt be god instead of mortal." \' She held the keys to heaven and hell \n(Elysium and Tartarus), thus anticipating the Mithraic pater patrum an \nhis Christian counterpart Peter. 2 \n\nPersephone was considerably older than the Eleusinian myth of \nclassical writings, which told of her descent into the underworld and \nher annual return to the earth each spring. She was really another nami \nfor Hecate, or Hel, and had ruled the underworld as Destroying \nMother Kali ruled it under the name of Prisni, which may have been \nthe origin of Persephone\'s Etruscan name, Persipnei. Romans called \nher Proserpine. It was under this name that she passed into Christian \ntradition as a Queen of She-Demons. 5 Like Kali the Destroyer, she \nwas the basic Death-goddess from the beginning. \n\n1. Legge 1,133. 2.

One solitary passage in \nie Gospel of Matthew said Jesus made a pun by giving Simon son of \n>nah the new name of Peter, "Rock" (Latin petra), saying he would \nund his church on this rock (Matthew 16:18-19). \n\nUnfortunately for papal credibility, the so-called Petrine passage \nas a forgery. It was deliberately inserted into the scripture about the \nrd century a.d. as a political ploy, to uphold the primacy of the Roman \ne against rival churches in the east. 1 Various Christian bishoprics \nere engaged in a power struggle in which the chief weapons were \nibery, forgery, and intrigue, with elaborate fictions and hoaxes \nritten into sacred books, and ruthless competition between rival parties \n* the lucrative position of God\'s elite. 2 \n\nMost early churches put forth spurious claims to foundation by \nxwtles, even though the apostles themselves were no more than the \nlandatory "zodiacal twelve" attached to the figure of the sacred king, \narly popes were often mere names, drawn from titles of Roman \nxls, such as Eleutherios or Soter, falsely inserted into an artificial \nironology to simulate succession from Peter. But even Catholic \nholars now admit that the stories of Peter\'s upside-down crucifixion \nrfbre Nero, and burial in the Vatican hill, were fictitious. 3 \n\nThe real roots of Peter\'s legend lay in pagan Roman myths of the \nty-god called Petra, or Pater Liber, assimilated to the Mithraic pater \nitwm (Father of Fathers), whose title was corrupted into papa, then \nDope." 4 This personage had been both a Rock and a Father that \n, a phallic pillar in the Vatican mundus since Etruscan times, when \nracular priests called vatis gave their title to the site. Other variations \nthe deity\'s name were Patriarch (Chief Father), Pompeius, and \natricius (Patrick). 5 Like Indian Brahmans, Roman "patricians" \naimed a patrilineal descent from the god. Since his name also meant a \n\n\n\n787 \n\n\n\nPeter, Saint rock, he was what the Old Testament called "the Rock that begat \n\nthee" (Deuteronomy 32:18). \n^^^^^^^^^^^ The god\'s stone phallus remained planted in the Vatican mount \n\nthrough the later centuries of the Roman empire and well into the \nMiddle Ages perhaps even into the 19th century, when a visitor said \nVatican authorities "kept in secret a large stone emblem of the \ncreative power, of a very peculiar shape." 6 Medieval names for such an \nobject perron, pyr, pierre show that it was both a "rock" and a \n"peter." Such was the ancient Pater\'s phallic scepter or pillar topped \nwith a pine cone, the thyrsus of Pater Liber. Church authorities often \nconverted a carved perron into a Christian symbol simply by placing a \ncross on its tip. 7 \n\nPater Liber\'s perron appeared in St. Peter\'s Church of the 14th \ncentury a.d., atop the round temple called Pantheon, renamed St. \nMary Rotunda. The temple had been buried under an artificial hill \nforming the court of St. Peter\'s, probably because it was known as a \nshrine of the Goddess. Local legend said the phallic stone had been \n"carried off there by the devil on the night on which the Virgin \nbrought Christ into the world." 8 \n\nThis "devil" probably meant the Horned God Bacchus (Pater \nLiber), whose phallic staff called baculus was allegedly carried by St. \nPeter, though not by the popes. A strange, garbled legend explained the \nloss of the baculus. Peter gave it to the earth in order to raise a saint \n\ncalled Maternus from the grave. This legend evidently arose from the \ncult of Bacchus, who sent his phallic staff into the underworld, \n^^^^ sometimes in the form of an inverted "Peter\'s cross," to fertilize the \n\nmaternal soil. Hence the oddly-named Maternus who rose like \nvegetation from the ground. The bones of St. Maternus were said to lie \nPeter\'s Cross under the foundation of the First Church of the Martyrs in Cologne, \n\nbuilt by the Empress Helena in Maternus\'s honor, a typical confusion ol \nchronologies. 9 \n\nHowever garbled, the legend of Peter\'s baculus was perpetuated \nby Germanic emperors, who claimed Peter\'s staff had passed from \nthe popes to Germany, betokening Teutonic leadership of the Holy \nRoman Empire. 10 Other medieval legends presented Peter in the \npagan role of a fertilizing spirit. For instance, he was said to make a \nwoman conceive by giving her an apple or a pine cone, symbols of \nBacchus and his bride. 11 \n\nPeter or Petra combined with other phallic "rocks," such as the \nobelisk at the gate of the Egyptian after-world, sacred to Par, the title \nof Ra as "Lord of the Phallus." 12 This was also called Petra. A \n"prophet" of Ra incarnate in the savior Osiris was known as Petosiris; \nhis tomb near Hermopolis was a great pilgrimage center about 341 B.C. \nA Greek prayer addressed him: "I invoke Petosiris whose venerated \nbody here lies. Today he is among the gods, he is now united with the \nWise." King Nechepso was possessed by his spirit, which took him on \na typical shamanic "night journey" to heaven. 13 Greco-Egyptian scrip- \n\n\n\n788 \n\n\n\ntures written under the names of Nechepso and Petosiris were Peter, Saint \n\npopular in the 2nd century b.c. 14 \n\nLike the obelisk, a phallic pillar stood at nearly all the "Pearly ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nGates" of the Great Mother\'s temples, representing the Petra who \ndemanded the right passwords of initiates entering the temple, and the \nsame initiates after death entering heaven. Petra also guarded the \ngates of the year, through which the ChristosAeon passed. Thus Peter \nwas identified with Janus, god of gateways, and came to be called the \nJanitor, "Gatekeeper." 15 \n\nThe church\'s festival of St. Peter used to be held on the day of \nJanus, when the sun entered the sign of Aquarius, symbol of both the \ngate of the year and the Pearly Gate of Maria-Aphrodite. 16 Pagan \nprecedents naturally assimilated St. Peter to the position of guardian \nof the janua coeli, "gate of heaven," formerly a yonic emblem of the \nVirgin Juno. Robert de Borron\'s romance of the Grail even suggest- \ned that Peter stood for the gate of Jesus\'s tomb: Jesus was laid under a \npierre, a peter-stone, such as marked the graves of ancient phallic \nheroes. 17 \n\nAs gatekeeper, Peter inherited the mystical keys based on the \ntrident of Shiva and the Osirian ankh, called Key of the Nile and also \na heavenly key to the Nile in the Sky (the Milky Way). Key-holding \ndeities generally gave or denied admittance to the land of the dead, \nwhether it was located in the earth or in the heavens. The Book of \nEnoch described various keepers of the heavenly mansions as key- \nholders: one for the winds, one for the seasons, one for the gates of hell, \netc. 18 Prayers to the Goddess Persephone called her Holder of the \nKeys; or, alternatively, her consort Hades was the holder of the keys to \nheaven and hell. 19 \n\nOn such pagan precedents rested the crucial doctrine of the papal \nkeys, as stated in the interpolated Gospel passage: "I [Jesus] will give \nunto thee [Peter] the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever \nthou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever \nthou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:19). \nThat is, holding the keys meant magic power. Whatever the key- \nholder commanded would come to be. This primitive idea underlay the \npowers of priests, bishops, popes, and the whole church organization. \nWithout the mystic keys, ecclesiastics\' blessings, cursings, baptisms, \nexorcisms, excommunications, prayers, or invocations were without \nefficacy. As Brahman priests commanded the gods by secret mantras, so \nChristian clergymen made the public believe the power of the keys \ncould cause God to act. \n\nThe Gospels suggest that Peter controlled even the Savior\'s \npassage through the holy gate. There is a ring of ritual about the story \nthat Peter denied Christ three times before the cock crew (Matthew \n26:34), as though some material of the ancient sacred drama were \nclumsily re-interpreted. The resurrected god couldn\'t enter into his \nkingdom until dawn. The angel of annunciation appeared as a cock, \n\n\n\n789 \n\n\n\nPeter, Saint \n\n\n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and geographer \nof the 2nd century \na.d. Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the \nancient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\n"to announce the coming of the Sun," as Pausanias said. 20 At cockcrow \nthe Savior arose as Light of the World to disperse the demons of \nnight. But if he tried to enter into his kingdom earlier, disrupting the \ncycles of night and day, the Gatekeeper would deny him. The \nritualistic denial took place also in the fertility cults of Canaan, where \nthe dying god Mot was denied by a priest representing the Heavenly \nFather. 21 \n\nThis story made difficulties for Christian theologians, when the \npagans inquired why Jesus should found his church on a disciple who \ndenied him instead of a more loyal one. The conventional answer was \nthat it demonstrated Christ\'s power of forgiveness. But during the \nlater persecutions, denial of Christ came to be considered the one \nabsolutely unforgivable crime. \n\nThe cock was another totemic "peter" sometimes viewed as the \ngod\'s alter ego. Vatican authorities preserved a bronze image of a \ncock with an oversize penis on a man\'s body, the pedestal inscribed \n"The Savior of the World." 22 The cock was also a solar symbol. Sun \nworship was evident in Christian literature, especially the "Gnostic \nGospel" of John. Mithraic solar symbolism entered into many papal \ncustoms. St. Peter\'s Chair, the papal throne, was decorated like the \nthrone of Mithra with zodiacal signs and the twelve labors of the sun \ngod. 23 \n\nAnother curious survival of the bird form of "Peter" was the water- \nwalking sea petrel, whose name meant "little peter." Petrels belonged \nto the legendary sea witch, Mother Carey, a corruption of Mater Cara, \nthe Latin Goddess Car or Ceres, "Mistress of Earth and Sea." \nEnglish sailors called the petrels Mother Carey\'s chickens, chicken \nbeing a diminutive of "cock," just as petrel was of "peter." 24 Like St. \nPeter, the petrels were "fishermen" who walked on water. Some said \nhowever that they were pagan souls who didn\'t reach hell before the \ngates were closed, and had to fly into "holes in the earth." 25 \n\nThe incident of Peter\'s water-walking (Matthew 14:29) was drawn \nfrom centuries of Oriental myth. Five hundred years before Chris- \ntians attributed this feat to Jesus and Peter, Buddhists were saying a sage \nproficient in yoga could walk on water. 26 Later medieval writers \nattributed the same miracle to various saints noted for asceticism. St. \nMaurus for example lived an especially pure life, and found himself \nable to walk on water after he was blessed by St. Benedict. 27 \n\nOther miracles attributed to Peter probably v/ere intended to \nprove that he truly possessed the power of the keys. Like Christ, he \ncould make the lame walk (Acts 3:7), and he could kill with a word, \nhis first victims being Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:5, 10). None of \nPeter\'s legends however suggest that he was a real person. Scriptures \nconcerning him were written (or forged) long after the epistles of \nPaul. 28 \n\nIt is now certain that there was no St. Peter in Rome to "found the \npapacy." 29 Stories about Peter were invented after the Roman see \n\n\n\n790 \n\n\n\nvas well established. During the first five centuries of the Christian era, \n10 one thought the bishop of Rome had a right to govern other \n>ishops; there was no such doctrine as the primacy of the Roman see. \n\'Christ neither founded nor desired the Church." 30 Indeed, the \nesus of the Gospels would have had no reason to found a church, since \nlis principal message was that the world was going to end almost at \njince. \n\nWhatever his origin, St. Peter stood for patriarchal opposition to \ne female principle, as shown by the Gnostic Gospels later censored \nut of the canon. The Dialogue of the Savior made the holy harlot \n4ary Magdalene the superior of all apostles; the Gospel of Mary said \nChrist loved her best, and gave her a secret revelation that Peter tried to \norce out of her. In the Pistis Sophia, Mary remarked, "Peter makes \ntie hesitate; I am afraid of him because he hates the female race." 31 \n\nMedieval legends also suggested Petrine anti-feminism. It was said \n>eter had a daughter, Petronilla (Little She-Peter), who was too \neautiful in Peter\'s opinion, so he prayed God to strike her with a fatal \nlness, and God complied. The Golden Legen d suggested that Peter \nsrtured women to exorcise them, as he caused them to vomit up the \nevils that possessed them, along with "much blood." 32 \n\nLegends aside, the real political power of the popes depended on \nopular acceptance of the doctrine of Peter\'s keys. Like a Brahman \nigh priest, the pope assumed absolute control of God, who would grant \nis vicar\'s slightest request. Thus invested with divine power on \narth, the pope became a figure comparable to the ancient god-kings, \n/orshipped with similar subservience and inclined toward a similar \nrrogance. 33 \n\nPope Innocent III set papal policy with a proclamation that "the \nord left to Peter the governance not of the church only, but of the \n/hole world." 34 Innocent was not content with the title "Vicar of \nhrist" but had it changed to "Vicar of God." 35 The bull Unam \nhnctam of Pope Boniface VIII stated that every human creature on \narth must be "subjected to the Roman pontiff." 36 In his jubilee year, \nloniface represented himself as the emperor of all Europe. He dressed \nlis cardinals as Roman priests, and himself in imperial armor, \nreclaiming, "I am the emperor; I am the Augustus." 37 \n\nBoniface came to power by tricking his simple-minded, 80-year- \nld predecessor Celestine into abdicating the throne. Boniface had \n^destine imprisoned in the fortress of Fumone, and had him mur- \nered, rumor said, by driving a nail into his head. Boniface\'s enemies \nherished as a holy relic Celestine\'s alleged skull, with a hole in it. \nloniface had many enemies because he used papal power to seize \ninds and towns of the wealthy Colonna family, to give them to his own \nimily, the Gaetani. Encountering resistance from the Colonnas, \nloniface preached crusades against them and plunged Italy into a \nloody civil war. He beseiged the Colonna city of Palestrina and \nffered to return half the enemy\'s possessions if the city were given up; \n\n\n\nPeter, Saint \n\n\n\nGospel of Mary \n\nOne of the early \nGnostic Gospels, \nonce included with the \nbooks of the New \nTestament but later \neliminated from the \ncanon. A copy was \nrediscovered in the \n1940s at Nag Hammadi. \n\n\n\n791 \n\n\n\nPhaedra but he broke his promise. Once it was in his hands, he had Palestrina \n\nrazed, its palaces, libraries, and treasure-houses sacked, its ground \n\n^ w ^^ m plowed and sown with salt. One of the Colonnas survived and \neventually assassinated Boniface. 58 \n\nA similarly avaricious heir of St. Peter was the highly inclement \npope Clement VII, nicknamed "the Butcher" because of his fond- \nness for massacre. He promised the mutinous people of Bologna that hi \nwould "wash his hands and feet in their blood." 39 At Cesena in 1376 \nhe offered mercy to the city, then killed five thousand of its citizens. \nThere were uprisings against him. Mobs hounded him out of Rome \nand Naples, crying, "Death to the Antichrist! Death to Clement and hi \ncardinals!" 40 \n\nOver all, the heirs of St. Peter have tended to follow the general \npattern of dictators, some less benevolent than others. If they had any \nquality in common, it was acquisitiveness. This appeared so consistently \nthat the Renaissance popes made it a heresy to say Jesus and Peter \nwere poor men. Visiting Rome in 1511, Martin Luther was so shocked \nby the decadent luxury of the papal court that he wrote: "If there is a \nhell, then Rome is built upon it. . . . Tiberius, the heathen Emperor, \neven if he were such a monster as Suetonius writes of, is nevertheless \nan angel in comparison with the present court of Rome. The same hat! \nto serve the supper table twelve naked girls." 41 It was rather a contrast \nwith the popular image of twelve apostles. \n\nl.Reinach,240. 2. H. Smith, 252. 3. Attwater, 274. 4. H.

Phaethon \nommitted the crime of hubris, offended his jealous Father, and was cast \nown from heaven like a lightning bolt. \n\nPhaethon tricked his father Helios-Apollo into allowing him to \nrive the solar chariot across the sky, playing the role of the great God \nimself. But Phaethon lacked his father\'s skill. He lost control of the \norses and nearly set the world afire with his reckless driving. His \nither threw him down into the sea just in time to save the earth from \neing ignited by the fiery sun-chariot. 1 \n\nPhaethon\'s myth didn\'t originate in Greece. It was an old tale from \nLhodes, the Island of the Sun, where white horses and a burning \nhariot were annually thrown into the sea to propitiate the Hittite sun \nod Tesup, whose cult had replaced that of the Moon-goddess \n)anae. 2 It seems likely that in primitive times there was also a charioteer \nlaying the role of Phaethon and giving up his life for the sake of a \nost-mortem godhood. \n\nI.

Lindsay, A.W., 131. \n\n\n\nhallus Worship \n\nLs Goddess-dominated religions made the yoni their holiest symbol, \n3 God-dominated religions adored the phallus. Patriarchal Semites \nworship ped their own genitals, and swore binding oaths by placing a \n\n\n\n793 \n\n\n\nPhallus Worship hand on each other\'s private parts, a habit still common among the \n\nArabs. 1 Words like testament, testify, and testimony still attesf to the \n^^^^^^^^^^^ m oaths sworn on the testicles. 2 \n\nAbraham\'s servant swore by placing his hand "under the thigh" of \nhis master (Genesis 24, 9) because "thigh" was a common euphe- \nmism for "penis," used in superstitious fear of mentioning the divine \norgan directly. Myths of male pseudo-birth like Zeus\'s fatherhood \nof Dionysus made the offspring come forth from the father\'s \n"thigh." 3 But the meaning was "penis," as in the Hindu myth that \nsubstituted the lingam for the yoni: the god Sukra (Seed) came out of \nthe stomach of the Great God by way of his penis. 4 \n\nAnother Middle-Eastern euphemism for "penis" was "knee," \ngenu, so often mentioned that some people came to believe the knee \nwas the source of seminal fluid. A father used to establish paternal rights \nto a child by setting the infant on his knee, which is why "genuine" \n(of the knee) came to mean "legitimate." In Mesopotamia the word \nbirku meant both "knee" and "penis." 5 In Latin it became virtu, \n"masculine spirit, virility, erect-ness." \n\nThe Bible calls Jacob\'s penis the sinew that shrank, lying "upon \nthe hollow of the thigh." Scholars have tried to interpret this limp \npenis as something else: a severed tendon, or a certain thigh muscle, \nwhich Jews were forbidden to eat (Genesis 32:32). But medieval \ntranslators frankly recognized the phallic meaning of the "sinew." They \nsaid the god-man\'s blighting touch on Jacob\'s shrunken member was \n"to cool the fires of concupiscence." 6 \n\nBiblical patriarchs worried inordinately about the vulnerability of \nthe penis and avoided direct mention of it lest evil spirits be drawn to \nit. Old Testament laws reveal a special fear of women\'s power over the \npenis. God\'s commandment was that a woman who grabs a man\'s \ngenitals must have her hand cut off, even if she does it to defend her \nhusband against an enemy (Deuteronomy 25:1 1-12). \n\nThe word "fascinate" is a relic of men\'s belief in the magic of their \nown genitals. Latin fascinum meant an erect penis (presumably \n"fascinating" to the opposite sex), especially in the form of a phallic \namulet. Such amulets continued to be used through the Middle Ages \nas antidotes to the evil eye. 7 In the 8th century a.d., the church forbade \nmen to pray to the fascinum. In the 9th century, the same prohibition \nhad to be repeated and again in the 12th and 1 3 th centuries, showing \nthat the custom went blithely on. 8 \n\nThe phallic principle was covertly worshipped in sacred posts and \npillars, such as the Maypole and the "bride-stake" erected at wed- \ndings, about which "the guests were wont to dance as about a \nMay-pole." 9 Stubbes in 1 583 described common folk dancing and \nhanging garlands on their Maypole, which he called a "stinking idol." 10 \nWomen of ancient Rome used to hang flower wreaths on the erect \npenis of the god Liber, to "have fruit of the seeds they sow," St. Augus- \ntine said. 11 \n\n\n\n794 \n\n\n\nThe same sexual ceremony of encircling the phallus with a female Phallus Worship \n\nwreath was perpetuated at Antwerp, where an ancient ithyphallic \n\nstatue of Priapus stood before the sanctuary of St. Walpurga, once the ^^^_-^^^^^_ \norgiastic Goddess of Walpurgisnacht or May Eve. Each year at the \nIspring festival, women hung wreaths of flowers on Priapus\'s penis. 12 \nAnother image of the same god was carried through the streets of \n(Naples in sacred processions, displaying a penis long enough to reach \nis chin. This excrescence was known as ilsanto membro, the Holy \n\nember. 13 \n\nA 1 3th-century Chronicle of Lanercost said that, at Easter, the \n\nrish priest of Inverkeithing "revived the profane rites of Priapus, \n\nllecting young girls from the villages, and compelling them to dance \n\ncircles to Father Bacchus. When he had these females in a troop, \nut of sheer wantonness, he led the dance, carrying in front on a poje a \nepresentation of the human organs of reproduction, and singing and \nancing himself like a mime." H This priest was less eccentric than one \nWiight think; the same sort of thing was happening all over Europe. \nPhallus worship was Christianized in ways that hinted at Christianity\'s \nkrue nature: a cult of the male principle. \n\nGiant phalli were adored up to the 17th century as saints, such as \nEutropius, Foutin, Guerlichon, Gilles, Regnaud, Rene, and Gui- \nknole. St. Foutin de Varailles was a phallic pillar kept red with libations \npf wine, as the phalli of Shiva were constantly reddened in Hindu \ntemples. 15 Ithyphallic saints in Normandy and Anjou were believed to \nImpregnate women who lay with them all night. The image of St. \npuignole had a large erect penis from which women scraped splinters as \nconception charms. So much scraping went on that the saint might \npave had his holy member whittled away entirely. But the priests, with \ncommendable foresight, made his phallus of a wooden rod that \npassed all the way through the statue to the back, where it was hidden by \na screen, and could be periodically thrust forward by a tap of a mallet \nas it diminished in front. 16 \n\nChrist assumed the role of a phallic god in providing the most \npopular of conception charms: the Holy Prepuce or more accurate- \ny, Prepuces, for there were hundreds of them in Renaissance churches. \n\\t least thirteen examples still survive. 17 All had the power to make \nvomen conceive. The most celebrated of the virile foreskins, housed at \nhe Abbey Church in Chartres, was credited with thousands of \nniraculous pregnancies. 18 St. Catherine of Siena went so far as to claim \nhat Jesus used his holy foreskin as her wedding ring. She was bound \no Jesus as his bride, "not with a ring of silver but with a ring of his holy \nlesh, for when he was circumcised just such a ring was taken from his \nloly body." 19 \n\nPhallic saints were special patrons of virility, much entreated by \nnen with sexual problems. Sir William Hamilton described the cult \n)f two phallic saints, Cosmo and Damiano, at Isernia in 1781: "Ex-voti \n)f wax, representing the male parts of generation, of various dimensions \n\n\n\n795 \n\n\n\nPhallus Worship ... are publicly offered for sale. . . . The Vow is never presented with- \n\nout being accompanied by a piece of money, and is always kissed by th \n\n^ ^_ devotee at the moment of presentation." The priests sold St. Cosmo\'s \nholy oil as a virility charm: \n\nThe oil of St. Cosmo is in high repute for its invigorating quality, when \nthe loins, and parts adjacent, are anointed with it. No less than 1400 Has! \nof that oil were either expended at the Altar in unctions, or charitably \ndistributed during the Fete in the year 1 780; and as it is usual for \neveryone, who either makes use of the Oil at the Altar, or carries off a Us \nof it, to leave an alms for St. Cosmo, the ceremony of the Oil becomes \nlikewise a very lucrative one for the Canons of the Church. 20 \n\nA hint of the broad extent of phallic Christianity in England \nappeared after World War II when Professor Geoffrey Webb, of the \nRoyal Commission on Historical Monuments, investigated a bomb- \ndamaged altar of an old church and found a large stone phallus within \nFurther researches showed that the altars of approximately 90% of \nEnglish churches built before 1 348 had hidden stone phalli. 21 By paga: \ntradition, an altar symbolized the female body which is why witches \nwere said to use a naked woman for their altar and the phallus within \nit obviously represented the Hidden God. \n\nSexual symbolism kept cropping up to embarrass scholars of \nreligion, like Georges Dumezil, who called "indiscreet" the Roman \nbelief that the sacred Palladium in the temple of Vesta was the scepter \nof Priam "in the likeness of a male sex organ." Yet Dumezil himself \nwrote, "Some day it will be necessary to restore to the history of \nreligions the idea of the symbol which is today so underrated and yet \nof such capital importance." 22 \n\nAn understanding of phallus worship is important for comprehen- \nsion of religious psychology, especially the fundamental insecurity of \nmale self-worship: for the phallic God was useless without the Goddess \nDr. Lederer says: \n\nDuring the aeons of feminine dominance, women were well content in \nthe possession of their own particular magic, and did not envy men \ntheir little tool that was so easily borrowed when it was needed. Indeed, \nthe Great Mother was never short of a phallus . . . the phallus was at \nher service. It was kept in evidence in the sanctuary of the Goddess, and \nwas not the phallus of any particular God or mortal, was not a man or a \nGod with a phallus, but it was simply a phallus per se, a depersonalized \ninstrument of ready and convenient use. Once used, it was no longer \nuseful. For the Great Mother, as for certain of her descendants today, \npenises are expendable: one can always get more, and the new ones are \nprobably better. The new ones, of course, are younger; and the fear of \nbeing spent, and doomed to replacement by a younger man both in . \nthe sexual and in the general service of the Goddess may on occasion b \na source of deep anxiety for the middle-aged male. 2 * \n\nPhallic anxiety was evident in all patriarchal systems, where fear \n\n\n\n796 \n\n\n\nof the devouring vulva led to both ascetic avoidance and persecution of Phallus Worship \n\nwomen. Phallic anxiety was the keynote of the one solitary joke in the \n\nMalleus MaleHcarum (Hammer for Witches), the Inquisition\'s official i^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhandbook. The monkish authors took the joke seriously, though it \n\nwas given them by some sly peasant whose purpose was mockery. The \n\nstory was that a witch stole a man\'s penis, but he caught her and \n\nforced her to reveal its whereabouts. She told him to climb a tall tree \n\nand look in a nest, which proved to be filled with penises. He chose \n\nthe biggest one, but the witch said he couldn\'t have that one; it \n\nbelonged to the parish priest. \n\nThe pious authors swallowed all this with great solemnity, and \nwrote: "What is to be thought of those witches who in this way \nsometimes collect male organs in great numbers, as many as twenty or \nthirty members together, and put them in a bird\'s nest, or shut them \nup in a box, where they move themselves like living members, and eat \noats and corn, as has been seen by many and is a matter of common \nreport?" 24 Even more to the point, what is to be thought of those \nchurchmen who believed it? \n\nPhallus worship often slid over the ill-defined line into homosex- \nuality, which was inevitable among men taught to adore the phallic \nprinciple in each other. Sometimes a homosexual kind of adoration was \nextended toward the superior male, or toward God. Among gypsy \nmen, the expression of ritual self-abasement was hav co kar, "I eat thy \npenis." It was explained that "If one should, for example, petition \nGod in prayer for a wish to be granted, he would precede his request by \nsaying, \'O God, I eat thy penis.\' " As with other eaten gods however, \n"the question whether it might be the last remnant of a very ancient \npractice of cannibalism must be considered." 25 \n\nPhallus worship is still evident in the symbols and sayings of the \nmodern world, though its meaning is less like impregnation and more \nlike death. Guns, cannon, missiles and other weapons are the phallic \nsymbols. In underworld slang, "to get a hard-on" means to pull a \ngun. 26 "Hits" and "scores" describe both attacks and sexual encounters. \nDominant men are "big shots" or "big guns." The ancient image of \nthe fructifying Lord of Life is unhappily transformed into a Lord of \nDeath when male power is identified with the power to destroy. In its \nworship of the masculine principle of aggression, the modern world \nsorely misses the central idea of ancient Goddess worship: that true \npower is the power to preserve. \n\n1.

Pillar \n\n\n\nPillar \n\n\n\nThe obelisk, Maypole, pillar, sacred tree trunk, upright cross, and \nother male divinity-symbols probably originated in India where Shiva\'s \nlingam (penis) was worshipped as a sacred pillar. Shiva\'s title Sthanu, \n"the Pillar," revealed him as a personified phallus. 1 Some of his holy \npillars are still popular pilgrimage centers. Land within a radius of \n100 cubits from such a pillar became known as the Kingdom of Shiva, \nwhere many miracles occur, including instant remission of sins. 2 \nSeasonal festivals still feature a Maypole representing Shiva\'s "Great \nLingam." 3 \n\nPhallic pillars appear also in northern Asia and Siberia, where such \nerections are entitled Powerful Posts of the Center of the City, or \nMan-Pillar of Iron. People pray to such pillars, calling them "Man" or \n"Father," offering them blood sacrifices. 4 \n\nBlood was anciently considered essential to the lingam-pillar, \nwhich Hindus frequently painted red or smeared with blood. Archaic \nEgyptian myth said two pillars, called "trees that shed blood," stood at \nthe entrance of the temple. The blood they shed could render \nwomen pregnant. 5 Here may be found a remnant of the primitive idea \nthat male blood, not semen, is the fertile essence, copied from \nNeolithic worship of female "moon-blood." The temple door repre- \nsented the yoni, entitled Er-per, the Holy Door of the Goddess. 6 \n\nAs in India, where Shiva\'s lingam was painted red or anointed with \nblood for religious festivals, so in Egypt the pillars in front of the \ntemple door were "blooded" in memory of primitive sacrifices when \nreal men were hung on them to bleed. Jews picked up this Egyptian \ncustom and blooded their doorposts for Passover with the vital fluid of \nthe sacrificial lamb. The doorposts represented phalli, like the pillars \nin front of Solomon\'s temple, named Boaz and Jachin, "Strength" and \n"God Makes Him Firm" (1 Kings 7:19-20). \n\nAt Hierapolis the temple of the Goddess had an enormous phallic \npillar on each side of the door. Every year, a man climbed to the top \nof each pillar and remained there for seven days, symbolically recapitu- \nlating ancient sacrifices when the pillars were bathed in the blood of \nhuman victims, who were evidently left hanging for one lunar week, \nperhaps in imitation of a menstrual period. 7 When Syria was Chris- \ntianized, the custom was continued by the "pillar saints" who, like their \npagan predecessors, thought themselves near enough to heaven for \ntheir prayers to be distinctly heard. 8 The most famous of them was St. \nSimeon Stylites, "Simeon of the Pillar," who stayed aloft until his \nlimbs became gangrenous and he died in a pungent odor of sanctity. 9 \n\nA church was built around a sacred pillar in Athens and named St. \n\n\n\n799 \n\n\n\nai \n\n\n\nPithos John of the Column. As pagans had previously come to tie their \n\nPlanetary Spheres illnesses to the pillar with silk thread, so the legendary St. John ordered \n\n^ ^^ m ^^^ "Let any sick come and tie a silk thread to the column and be \n\nhealed." 10 \n\nPillars in conjunction with churches as a spire or campanile \n\nnot often recognized as male symbols in contact with a female one, \n\nalthough the shikhara or spire associated with a Hindu temple is \n\ngenerally viewed as a phallus. 11 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty.354. 2.

The identity of the Great \nMother with this vessel of rebirth and regeneration was an idea \ncommon to most ancient cultures, where the manufacture of pots and \nvases of all kinds was usually the business of women. 1 \n\nIn Christian custom the pithos was transformed into the pyx or \n"box" that enclosed the body of Christ; and Erasmus confused the \ntwo vessels in translating the patriarchal version of Pandora\'s myth. \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 132-33. \n\n\n\nPlanetary Spheres \n\nThe Chaldean astrological cosmology was generally accepted \nthroughout the Mediterranean world in the early Christian era. Accord \ning to this cosmology, the earth lay under a series of nested, inverted j \ncrystal bowls, turned independently of each other by star-angels. This \nidea accounted for the independent movement of sun, moon, and \nplanets against the fixed stars. Each "sphere" had its tutelary deities. In \nEgypt these were known as the Seven Heavenly Midwives, emana- \ntions of Hathor, who guarded the seven gates of heaven. Souls seeking \nentrance must address them with hekau, words of power. The first of \nthem was greeted: "Lady of tremblings, surrounded by lofty walls, the \nchieftainess, lady of destruction, the disposer of the words that drive \naway storms and deliver from destruction him that traveleth along the \nway." 1 \n\nUnder the earth lay the celestial spheres\' mirror image, seven \nnether spheres descending into the Abyss. These divisions of the \nunderworld were called Seven Recesses, Seven Gates, abysses, bothroi, \nantra, mychoi, pylai, or chasma (pits). 2 At the bottom lay the \n\n\n\n800 \n\n\n\n"oundations of the earth, "the meeting of the mighty waters." Like the Planetary Spheres \n\n.elestial gates, the underworld gates were guarded by special porters, \n\nhe Assyro-Babylonian maskim or Anunnaki. Ziggurats were models of ^^^^_-^^^^_ \n\nihe upper and lower planetary spheres. Ascending heavens were \n\nepresented by the terraces of the ziggurat, known as the Stages of the \n\nSeven Spheres of the World. 3 Underneath, inside the temple, were \n\neven corresponding "deeps" or "pits." \n\nInitiations in the temple apparently mimicked the descent into the \ninderworld pits and a journey through the heavenly stages also. \n\\puleius described his initiation into the Mysteries of Isis as a descent \nnto the land of death, to the threshold of Isis-Nephthys, or Persepho- \nle the Destroyer. He beheld the Black Sun, nether image of the solar \n;od. Then he ascended through the lower and upper worlds and saw \nface to face" the deities of both. Finally he rose to the heights and was \nxhibited to the congregation in the costume of the sun god. 4 The \nourney of each initiate was a theatrical performance, with priests and \nriestesses wearing the costumes and masks of the appropriate spirits, \nnd dramatic descents through dark caves and other specially decorated \nooms. The impressive effects may well be imagined. \n\nEarly Christians believed all souls descended from heaven to enter \nleir bodies of flesh on earth, during the descent taking faults and \nassions from each sphere to sully their initial purity and cause tempta- \non. This was the origin of the Seven Deadly Sins. "As the souls \nescend, they draw with them the torpor of Saturn, the wrathfulness of \n/lars, the concupiscence of Venus, the greed for gain of Mercury, \nie lust for power of Jupiter; which things effect a confusion in the \njuls, so that they can no longer make use of their own power and \nleir proper faculties." 5 After living the right sort of life, the soul could \nj-ascend after death, shedding its sinful qualities one by one. 6 \nometimes the spirits of the planetary spheres acted as inspectors after \nie Egyptian manner: "As men ascend, they find custom-houses \nuarding the way with great care and obstructing the soaring souls, each \nustom-house examining for one particular sin, one for deceit, \nnother for envy, another for slander, and so on in order, each passion \naving its own inspectors and assessors." 7 \n\nGnostic mystery-cults copied the pagans, in that they taught \nasswords and charms to propitiate the guardian spirits of each \n)here. In the Pistis Sophia, Jesus told his followers: "Stay not your \nand until ye find the cleansing mysteries which will cleanse you so \ni to make you pure light, that ye may go into the heights and inherit \nie light of my kingdom." 8 The heights meant the Empyrean, where \nk)d lived in the highest heaven. Those who attained true enlighten- \nlent would enter the Godhead and become God, just as Oriental \niges believed they could enter Nirvana and become one with the \nlfinite. 9 In China, the successively higher heavens were even \nraphically illustrated by the multiple roofs of the pagoda, one above \nlother. 10 \n\n\n\n801 \n\n\n\nPleiades The days of the week are still named after the planetary spheres. \n\nMonday is the Day of the Moon (dies lunae). Tuesday is Tiw\'s Day, \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ named for the Saxon god who was the counterpart of Mars; it is the Day \nof Mars in Latinate languages (French mardi). Wednesday is Wo- \nden\'s Day, dies mercurii, named for the Teutonic god considered the \nequivalent of Mercury. The once-supreme Woden was ousted from \nthe list in the very country of his origin, Germany, and replaced by a \nneutral Mittwoch, "Mid-week." \n\nThor\'s Day was named for the thunder-god who was a Germanic \nequivalent of Jove; Romans called it diesjovis. Friday was Freya\'s \nDay (Frea-Tag), Rome\'s dies veneris, the day sacred to Venus-Aphro- \ndite-Freya the only wholly feminine day, which may be why so \nmany superstitions were connected with it. The Goddess\'s day was \nfollowed by Saturn\'s Day, then by the Day of the Sun (dies soh\'s), \nassociated with the "fiery" heaven of aether. \n\nAs the planets ruled various divisions of heaven, so also they were \nbelieved to rule various places on earth according to their qualities. \nUnder the sun were "light places, the serene air, kings\' palaces and \nprinces\' courts, pulpits, theatres, thrones, and all kingly and magnifi- \ncent places." Under the moon were "wildernesses, highways, groves, \nwoods, rocks, hills, mountains, forests, fountains, waters, rivers, seas, \nseashores, ships, and granaries for corn." Under Mars were "fiery and \nbloody places, furnaces, bakehouses, shambles, places of execution, \nand places where there have been great battles fought and slaughters \nmade." Under Mercury were "shops, schools, warehouses, ex- \nchanges for merchants." Under Jupiter were "all privileged places, \nconsistories of noblemen, tribunals, chairs, places for exercise, \nschools, and all beautiful and clean places, and those sprinkled with \ndivers odors." Under Venus were "pleasant fountains, green mead- \nows, flourishing gardens, garnished beds, stews, the sea, the seashore, \nbaths, dancing places, and all places belonging to women." Under \nSaturn were "all stinking places, and dark, underground, religious, and \nmournful places, as church-yards, tombs, and houses not inhabited by \nmen; and old, tottering, obscure, dreadful houses; and solitary dens, \ncaves, and pits; also fish-ponds, standing pools, sewers." 11 \n\n\\.BookoftheDcnd,27\\-72. 2.

The importance attached to this small \ngroup of dim stars seems out of proportion to their apparent \ninsignificance. \n\nThe sacrifice of the Mexican savior Xipe Totec, Our Lord the \nFlayed One, took place on the Hill of the Stars at the moment when \n\n\n\n802 \n\n\n\nthe Pleiades reached the zenith on the last night of the Great Year Pleiades \n\ncycle. It was thought if the Sisters were not propitiated by the \n\nsacrifice, the universe would fall to pieces and the world would come to ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nan end. 1 \n\nPre-Vedic India also attached sacrificial significance to the Pleia- \ndes, called Seven Mothers of the World, or Krittikas, "razors" or \n"cutters." They were also seven priestesses who "judged" men a \ncognate was Greek kritikos, "judge" and sometimes "critically" \nwounded them, for their razors were castrating moon-sickles. The fire \ngod Agni copulated with the Seven Mothers while they were men- \nstruating, the usual Tantric rite later outlawed by the Vedic priesthood. \nThey gave birth to a solar hero enveloped in a great red cloud \n(female symbol) penetrated by bolts of lightning (male symbol). The \nhero was sacrificially slain, wounded in the side with a spear, and \nfrom his body sprang his reincarnation, another hero like himself. 2 In \nthis myth may be discerned rites of great antiquity, predating the \ndiscovery of fatherhood, when blood was the essence of generation. \n\nThe Pleiades were prominent in the early cult of Aphrodite, who \nwas supposed to have given birth to them under her name of Pleione. \nAphrodite was a castrating Crone-goddess as well as a Holy Dove; and \nthe Pleiades were "a flock of doves." 3 They were connected with \nsacrificial New Year ceremonies in Greece as in central America and \nsoutheastern Asia. The Seven Sisters stood at the zenith on New \nYear\'s Eve as if to select the god of the new Aeon. Old Babylonian texts \nbegan the year with the Pleiades. Later, the zodiacal sign of the New \nYear became Aries, the Ram. 4 \n\nEgyptian texts allude to the Pleiades\' archaic significance as \nKrittikas, judges of men, assigning them also to seven planetary \nspheres as the seven Hathors. The dead had to speak the names of these \nGoddesses to pass their "critical" examinations and enter paradise: \n"Hail, ye seven beings who make decrees, who support the Balance on \nthe night of the judgment of the Utchat, who cut off heads, who hack \nnecks in pieces, who take possession of hearts by violence and rend the \nplaces where hearts are fixed, who make slaughterings in the Lake of \nFire, I know you, and I know your names; therefore know ye me, even \nas I know your names." 5 The reference to tearing out hearts is \nremarkably evocative of Aztec religious customs. The Seven Mothers \nWho Make Decrees appeared also in Arabia as Seven Sages or \nimams (from ima, "mother"). 6 \n\nIn classical mythology the Pleiades represented the Maytime feast \nof life and the November feast of death at opposite points of the year. \nThey were emanations of the Moon-goddess "who was worshipped at \nthe two solstices as the Goddess of alternatively Life-in-Death and \nDeath-in-Life and who early in November, when the Pleiades set, sent \nthe sacred king his summons to death." 7 Prayers for the dead were \nrecited before the Pleiades on November 1 , which became All Soul\'s \nDay. 8 \n\n\n\n803 \n\n\n\nPluto Greeks said the leader of the Pleiades was the Dove-goddess \n\nAlcyone, the "halcyon" bird who brought good weather for the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ planting season. Another Pleiad was Electra, mother of Dardanus, \nlegendary founder of Troy, whose name is still preserved in the \nDardanelles. Another Pleiad was Merope, "Bee-eater," a title of Aphro^ \ndite\'s queen bee as devourer of the drone. Some said Merope was \none of the Furies; others said she married the doomed sun-hero \nSisyphus. Still another Pleiad was Maia "the Maker" or the "Grand- \nmother," mother of Hermes the Enlightened One, as her Hindu \ncounterpart Maya mothered Buddha the Enlightened One. 9 \n\nClassical writers seemed anxious to disguise the real nature of the \nPleiades. One story insisted they were all virgins. Orion the Hunter \ntried to rape them, but Zeus protected them by turning them into doves \nand placing them in the heavens. The story was obviously absurd, as \nall the Pleiades had lovers or husbands, and three of them had mated \nwith Zeus himself. In earlier myths, Orion the Hunter was their \nvictim, not their attacker. The Huntress of the Seven Stars, Artemis, \nshot him to death in the sea, suggesting that victims were sometimes \nriddled with arrows then consigned to the deep. 10 \n\nArtemis personified another set of seven stars, the much larger \nconstellation Ursa Major, the "Great She-Bear," who may have been \nanother version of the Seven Sisters. Artemis and Aphrodite both were \nassociated with ancient cults of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom, seven \nmantic priestesses of Seven-Gated Thebes, where the Seven Hathors \nonce ruled, where sacred kings were slain every seventh year, and \nwhere Teiresias was castrated and lived seven years as a temple woman. \nThe same magic seven were called Seven Midwives in Egypt and the \nOrient. They were probably represented in pre-patriarchal Jerusalem by \nthe holy Menorah (seven-branched candlestick) symbolizing the \nsevenfold Men-horae or Moon-priestesses, as shown by its female- \ngenital decorations, lilies and almonds (Exodus 25:33). \n\nMedieval superstitions betrayed fear of groups of seven females, \nperhaps a relic of ancient images of the Sisters. East Frieslanders \nbelieved that in any family of seven sisters, one of the seven was sure to \nbe a vampire or a werewolf. 11 The sevenfold grouping could also be \narranged in a vertical line of descent, e.g. in the ubiquitous belief that a \nseventh daughter of a seventh daughter was always a witch. \n\nI.

"This is the good end of those \nvho have attained gnosis: to become God." \' See Antinomianism. \nA medieval prophet named Giovanni Mercurio da Correggio \nissimilated himself to Poimandres who seems to have been, in this \n:ontext, a reincarnation of Jesus.

Hellenic mythographers said both Kore and \n\nEurydice were detained in the underworld because they ate pome- \ngranate seeds there. Nana, virgin mother of the savior Attis, conceived \nhim by eating either a pomegranate seed or an almond, another yonic \nsymbol. \n\nThe Bible says the pillars of Solomon\'s temple were ornamented \nwith the female-genital symbols of lilies and pomegranates (1 Kings \n7:18-20). Solomon himself impersonated the phallic god Baal-Rim- \nmon, "Lord of the Pomegranate," when he was united with his divine \nbride, the mysterious Shulamite, and drank the juice of her pomegran- \nate (Song of Solomon 8:2). \n\nArgive Hera was worshipped as Our Lady With the Pomegranate \nat Capaccio Vecchio near Paestum, formerly a Sybarite colony called \nPoseidonia. In ancient times the people laid at the Goddess\'s feet \nofferings of little boats filled with flowers, as she sat enthroned with her \nchild on one arm, a pomegranate in her other hand, inviting contemph \ntion of the miracle of her bringing forth life. About the 12th century \na.d. the people of Paestum built her a new shrine, to which pilgrimages \nare made to this day. There sits Our Lady With the Pomegranate still, \nenthroned with her child on one arm, a pomegranate in her other \nhand. 2 The people lay at her feet offerings of little boats filled with \nflowers. \n\nHera was Mother Earth, and the suit of pentacles in the Tarot \npack represented the earth element. Therefore it is not surprising to \nfind this suit transformed in some medieval packs into a Suit of \nPomegranates, the fruit always opened in an oval orifice to show its \nmoist red interior. 5 \n\n1.

He was "greedy of Possession \n\nearthly kingdoms" that is, his priests were and so his myths tell how "^^^^^^^"" \n\nhe took territories from various forms of the Goddess. He pretended \n\nto marry the Triple Goddess herself, under her name of Amphitrite, \n\nand demoted her to a mere sea nymph. He tried to take Argolis from \n\nHera, and Athens from Athene. He claimed to have invented the horse \n\nbridle, though Athene had already done it. He demanded that \n\nwomen be deprived of their vote in Athens, and forbade men to \n\ncontinue taking the surnames of their mothers as they had formerly \n\ndone. 1 He even claimed husbandship of the venerable Mare-Demeter \n\non the ground that he had once raped her in the form of a stallion. \n\nYet Poseidon was an upstart god, transparently subject to the \nGoddess in his earlier myths. "He had, properly speaking, no name \nof his own, but was simply known as \'the spouse of Earth.\' He only \nbecame a great god when his original nature, and also the origin of \nhis name, were forgotten." 2 \n\nWhen Poseidon sent a flood on the Xanthian plain, the Xanthian \nwomen beat him off and saved their country by hoisting their skirts \nand marching on him with their genitals exposed.

Graves, CM. 1, 254. \n\n\n\nPossession \n\nThe idea that a human body may be possessed by a supernatural \npersonality, in addition to its own natural one, occurs in every religion. \nChristians believed in several kinds of possession, both divine and \ndemonic. The Catholic church retains the office of exorcist because it \nstill considers demonic possession real. At the same time, god- \npossession was the central idea of Christ\'s incarnation, and it is believed \nthat a worshipper may be possessed by the spirit of Christ, often in \nthe ecstatic manner of the primitive shaman. Some Christian sects \ncalled this "getting the spirit." \n\nPagan mystery cults brought about god-possession by eating the \ngod (as did Christians also), and by initiatory rites and formulae. The \nMithraic initiate said he was "rendered immortal in this hour by the \ngood will of God in his abounding goodness . . . that I may be \ninitiated and that the Holy Spirit may breathe within me." A Hermetic \npapyrus prayed the god to enter into the worshipper, "for thou art I \n\nand I am thou I know thee, Hermes, and thou knowest me; I am \n\nthou, and thou art I." Possession by Hermes the Wise Serpent \n\nwould have been "diabolic" possession from the Christian point of view; \n\nbut the principle was the same everywhere. \n\nPeople possessed by pagan gods sometimes created a tradition \ndirectly inherited by Christianity. Worshippers of Attis castrated \n\n\n\n807 \n\n\n\nPossession themselves when fully possessed by the spirit of their castrated god. \n\nUnder the same influence "they flogged themselves until the blood \n^^^^^^^^^^^ came. In Italy such processions of flagellants during Passion Week have \ncontinued until the present day, the Madonna being the patroness of \nthese Re penitenti (penitent kings)" instead of the Great Mother of the \nGods, who formerly governed their bloodlettings. 2 \n\nTo be possessed meant to take the spirit into one\'s body, either as \nthe flesh of a sacrificial victim or as bread and wine representing that \nflesh. For the same reason that Christ "entered into" those who ate \nhim, so possession by devils was thought to occur through incautious \neating. St. Gregory the Great told of a nun who became possessed by a \ndevil after eating a bit of lettuce. The devil complained to the \nexorcist, "What wrong have I done? Here I was sitting upon this \nlettuce, and she came and ate me!"\' To speak a blessing over food \nbefore eating was originally supposed to drive out whatever devils might \nbe lurking there. \n\nPope Gregory professed an ability to recognize the signs of \ndemonic possession under any circumstances. When a horse kicked \nand plunged and refused to let him mount, he instantly realized the \nhorse was possessed by a demon. He even knew the possession had \nbeen caused by two magicians, whom he arrested, blinded, and tortured \ninto confessions. Afterward, they were "cared for" at the church\'s \nexpense for the rest of their lives, meaning they were imprisoned for \nlife. 4 \n\nAll primitive people think humans, animals, and inanimate objects \nmay serve as vessels for spirits. "The Maori term waka clearly \nindicates that the inspired man carries the god in him as a canoe carries \nits owner." 5 Our own vocabulary expresses the same belief. Inspira- \ntion means breathing in a spirit; enthusiasm means the god within. We \nsay, "What possessed you to do that?" or "I don\'t know what got into \nme." An obsessive person may be called devil-ridden or hag-ridden. \n\nEuripides called Dionysus the god of prophecy, because he took \npossession of the body through divine madness, which "makes those \nwhom he maddens foretell the future." 6 We still speak of being \n"possessed" by prophetic or poetic frenzy. Mediums are "possessed" \nby spirits of the dead, who speak through them as demons were said to \nspeak through their human hosts. \n\nMen never abandoned the notion of alien spirits within the human \nmind. Not only was the god-within concept essential to the commu- \nnion rite, but the devil-within concept was also essential to discrediting \nother deities, whose communion rites were the same. Moreover, \ndiabolic possession was affirmed by the scriptures. Summers said, "We \nhave the authority of Christ Himself as to its reality. . . . [N]o reader \nof the Scriptural narrative can deny that Christ by word and deed \nshowed His entire belief in possession by evil spirits. And if Christ \nwere divine how came He to foster and encourage a delusion?" 7 \n\nThe third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica gave the same \nofficial opinion under Demoniacs: "The reality of demoniacal posses- \n\n808 \n\n\n\nsion stands on the same evidence with the gospel system in general." A Possession \n\n19th-century Catholic authority wrote, "To deny possession by devils \n\nis to charge Jesus and his apostles with imposture How can the ^^^^^_^^__ \n\ntestimony of apostles, fathers of the Church, and saints who saw the \npossessed and so declared, be denied?" 8 \n\nSeventeenth-century clergymen fought the "evil heart of unbe- \nlief" that led people to doubt the reality of demonic possession and \nthe efficacy of exorcism. Priests vied with each other to see who could \ncast out the most demons. In a highly publicized case, Sister Made- \nleine de la Palud of the Ursuline convent of Aix-en-Provence was found \nto contain 6,666 demons including Beelzebub, Leviathan, Baalber- \nith, Asmodeus, and Astaroth the cream of hell\'s celebrities. 9 Jesuits at \nVienna claimed over 12,000 demons in a single case of possession. \nOne skeptic, Bishop Miron, suspected the possessed Martha Brossier of \nfakery when her demon sent her into convulsions at the reading of \nwhat she thought was a Latin Bible; it was actually a copy of Virgil\'s \nAeneid. Miron called the girl a fraud, but the Capuchin monks \nrejected his verdict as "Godless." 10 \n\nFraud was a major ingredient of incidents of possession, often \ndeliberately fostered by clergymen to trump up a dramatic demon- \nstration of their power over the forces of evil. At Salmesbury in 1612, \nthree women were accused of causing possession in a girl, who later \nadmitted that she had been coached by a Roman Catholic priest who \nwanted the women prosecuted, because they had defected from his \nchurch and turned Protestant. 11 Sir Walter Scott observed: \n\nThe Catholic church had much occasion to rally around her all the \nrespect that remained to her in a schismatic and heretical kingdom; and \nwhen her fathers and doctors announced the existence of such a dreadful \ndisease [as possession], and of the power of the church \'s prayers, relics, \nand ceremonies, to cure it, it was difficult for a priest, supposing him more \ntender of the interest of his order than that of the truth, to avoid such a \ntempting opportunity as a supposed case of possession offered for display- \ning the high privilege in which his profession made him a partner, or to \nabstain from conniving at the imposture, in order to obtain for his church \nthe credit of expelling the demon. It was hardly to be wondered at, if \nthe ecclesiastic was sometimes induced to aid the fraud of which such \nmotives forbade him to be the detector. ,2 \n\nSome cases were not consciously faked. Symptoms of possession \ncould be produced by such causes as hysteria, epilepsy, sexual frustra- \ntions, depression, or plain boredom. Ascetics in monasteries and \nconvents were most prone to demonic possession, which seemed a way \nto relieve the isolation, inactivity, and drabness of the cloistered life. \nNuns were often imprisoned in convents against their will, because \nhusbands wished to be rid of them, or because their parents could \ngive them no dower and so compelled them to be brides of Christ. 13 \nThe church\'s word for the depression that afflicted nuns and monks \nwas acedia, "abysmal apathy." H \n\nScreaming fits, blasphemies, sexual fantasies, and erotomania of \n\n809 \n\n\n\nPossession the possessed sprang directly from hatred of convent life, as shown by j \n\nthe nun Jeanne des Anges: \n\n^^^^^^i^^"" My mind was often filled with blasphemies, and sometimes I uttered them \n\nwithout being able to take any thought to stop myself. I felt for God a \ncontinual aversion. . . . The demon beclouded me in such a way that I \nhardly distinguished his desires from mine; he gave me moreover a \nstrong aversion for my religious calling, so that sometimes when he was in \nmy head I used to tear all my veils and such of my sisters \' as I might lay \nhands on; I trampled them underfoot, I chewed them, cursing the hour \nwhen I took the vows. . . . More often than not I saw quite well that I \nwas the prime cause of my troubles and that the demon acted only \naccording to the openings I gave him. . . . As I presented myself at \nCommunion, the devil took possession of my head, and after I had \nreceived the blessed host and half moistened it the devil threw it in the \npriest\'s face. 15 \n\nThere was a time when demonic possession was almost as \ncontagious as the common cold. It would sweep through a cloister like \nan epidemic. A 1 5th-century German convent suffered an outbreak \nof possession in which all the nuns took to biting one another. In a \nFrench convent, they began mewing like cats. At Aix in 161 1, a man \nwas burned at the stake for sending an extraordinary number of demons \ninto the nuns; one nun alone was possessed by 6500 demons. 16 \n\nPossession served as an excuse for orgiastic goings-on at several \nconvents in the 1 7th century. Father confessors at Louviers from \n1628 to 1642 instructed the nuns in lesbian intercourse, celebrated \ncommunion naked, and staged obscene masses where the officiating \npriest would attach a host to his penis, and engage in coitus or sodomy. \nNuns were forced by their "demons" to frequent coupling with both \n"devils" and prelates. At Auxonne, the Mother Superior was accused of \ncausing possession among the nuns by teaching them to masturbate \nwith a dildo. At Nimeguen, possessed nuns claimed to be sexually \nassaulted by black priapic creatures lurking in their beds. Even in the \nlate 19th century, erotic hysteria infected the sisters of Mont-Saint- \nSulpice at the instigation of a "possessed" nun Cantianille, allegedly \nviolated by a priest and dedicated to the devil at the tender age of 1 5. 17 \n\nMaria Renata Sanger, sub-prioress of a convent at Wurzburg, \nwas executed for bewitching other nuns and causing them to be \nseduced by demons in the form of handsome young men. 18 One \nwould naturally suspect that these "demons" were made of quite solid \nmaterial and entered the convent by night through some secret hole \nin the wall, with a certain amount of assistance from within. \n\nErotomania was the major ingredient of one of the most famous \ncases of fraudulent possession, that of the nuns of Loudun in the \n1630s, which ended in the legal murder of a priest, Urbain Grandier, \nwhose misfortune it was to have made some powerful enemies. \n\nWith the Mother Superior setting the example, claiming posses- \nsion by four major demons Leviathan, Balan, Iscaron, and \n\n\n\n810 \n\n\n\nBehemoth the nuns accused Father Grandier of causing their fren- Possession \n\nzies, which only grew worse with every attempt at exorcism. 19 The \n\npriest maintained his innocence though hideously tortured; his legs were ^_^^^^^^^^^ \ncrushed to pulp in the boots. He refused to name any accomplices, as \nthe custom demanded. To build their case, his torturers said he was \nreally invoking the devil when he prayed aloud to God for deliver- \nance from his sufferings. 20 At last a phony pact with the devil was forged \nand "found" to seal his doom. It said: \n\nMy Lord and Master, I own you for my God; I promise to serve you while \nI live, and from this hour I renounce all other gods and Jesus Christ and \nMary and all the Saints of Heaven and the Catholic, Apostolic, and \nRoman Church, and all the goodwill thereof and the prayers which \nmight be made for me. I promise to adore you and do you homage at least \nthree times a day and to do the most evil that I can and to lead into evil \nas many persons as shall be possible to me, and heartily I renounce the \nChrism, Baptism, and all the merits of Jesus Christ; and, in case I \nshould desire to change, I give you my body and soul, and my life as \nholding it from you, having dedicated it forever without any will to \nrepent. Signed URBAIN GRANDIER in his blood. 2 \' \n\nAfter Urbain Grandier was burned at the stake, possession of the \nnuns continued. It had become a tourist attraction, and the sisters were \ncelebrities. They learned to show off for the crowds, like Sister Claire: \n\nShe fell on the ground, blaspheming, in convulsions, lifting up her \npetticoats and chemise, displaying her privy parts without any shame, \nand uttering filthy words. Her gestures became so indecent that the \naudience averted its eyes. She cried out again and again, abusing herself \nwith her hands, "Come on then, foutez-moi! [fuck me]!" 22 \n\nPossession was often achieved by children and adolescents, who \nknew with a sure instinct what would gain them the most attention. The \nconveniently timed hysteria of adolescent girls, followed up by adults\' \nsuperstitious fears, created the notorious witch-craze at Salem, Massa- \nchusetts; the basic idea had long been common in England. Panicked \nby any sign of fits in a child, parents and neighbors immediately began a \nsearch for the witch who was to blame." Needless to say, any child \nwho learned what a stir he could cause in this way was strongly \nmotivated to repeat it. \n\nIn 1 595 a thirteen-year-old Staffordshire boy learned to throw fits \nat the sight of a woman named Alice Gooderidge, who was tortured \nby having her feet burned to induce her to confess sending a demon \ninto the child. Upon being faced with him, Alice pleaded, "Thomas, \nI pray you forgive me and be good to me." But Thomas only fell into "a \nmarvelous sore fit," went into a trance, "saw a man come out of the \nchamber pot, flames of fire, and the heavens open." To Alice he said, \n"Yonder comes Mother Red Cap, look how they beat her brains out, \nsee what it is to be a witch; see how the toads gnaw the flesh from her \nbones." Alice Gooderidge was convicted of witchcraft and died in \nprison. 2 \n\n\n\n811 \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\n\nPossession Faked possession was used to condemn 80-year-old Ann Boden- \n\nham in 1653. A servant girl caught with stolen silverware accused \n\n^ m ^^^^ Ann Bodenham of sending a demon into her in the form of a black man \nwithout a head. The girl went into fits in Mrs. Bodenham\'s presence \nbut was instantly relieved when the "witch" was removed from the \nroom. She described how Mrs. Bodenham had transformed herself \ninto a black cat to tempt her into the devil\'s service. 25 Convicted and on \nher way to the gallows, the old woman called for beer, and cursed all \nwho refused her. As was the custom, the hangman asked her forgiveness \nbefore turning her off the ladder. She snapped, "Forgive thee? A pox \non thee, turn me off," and died in her rage. 26 \n\nAt Norfolk in 1 600, a woman named Margaret Francis allegedly \nbewitched a girl who exhibited the usual symptoms of possession: \n\nTearing her hair, and beating herself, and her head against bedsteads and \nstools, sometimes foaming, sometimes dolefully shrieking and blaring \nlike a calf; groaning, howling, and barking like a dog; and biting like a mad \ndog. Her head, feet, and legs were drawn awry and almost backward; \nand she stared, & gaped most fearfully and gnashed her teeth and lay as 1 \ndead and senseless many times a day and more sometimes together, \nwithout breath or panting, saving that her natural color remained still \nfresh; and yet, sometimes suddenly she did spit in the faces of them that \nstood by or at her friends or at the name of Jesus; and sometimes she did , \nsmite at her parents also . . . sometimes storming at God and good \nmen, and sometimes blaspheming God, saying God is a good man I can I \ndo as much as he; I care not for Jesus, etc. Some things were uttered, \nunknown before to the maid; and many times in a strange snappish voice; \nand sometimes in the tune and voice of the witch and in her phrases \nand terms. 27 \n\nExorcism rarely relieved such symptoms, but more often exac- \nerbated them, since the exorcistic ritual only increased the effect desired \nby making the afflicted one all the more a center of attention. More \npractical cures brought about the miracle that exorcism failed to pro- \nduce. In 1835 an epidemic of possession was well under way at a \nFrench convent in Morzine. Professor Tissot investigated, and found \nthe nuns went into fits at the touch of holy water if they knew what it \nwas, but secretly they could be dosed with quarts of it in wine or food, \nwithout effect. The demons were cast out by the police, who \nappeared with orders to treat the possessed as lunatics and remove them \nto an asylum. Immediately, all symptoms vanished. 28 \n\nThe Dutch physician Boerhaave found an epidemic of possession \nin a Haarlem hospital ward, with patients going into convulsions and \nimitating each other in acts of frenzy. He ordered a brazier of coals and \na cauterizing iron placed in the ward, and promised to brand the next \nvictim of possession. There were no more cases. A similar report from \nJapan told of the miraculous cure of a possessed girl, whose father \ntied her to a pillar and rushed at her with a drawn sword, crying, \n\n\n\n812 \n\n\n\npicked spirit, if you do not forthwith leave this child I will kill you Possession \n\nloth!" The child was instantly cured. 29 \n\nSome authorities recommended flagellation as a cure for posses- ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nj.on. Bergomensi said a "prudent and moderate" whipping could \n|/ork wonders. 30 Of course it never worked in cases of illness caused by \njemonic possession. Demons were convenient scapegoats for igno- \njant doctors, and many diseases were attributed to possession. Some \nuthorities even insisted that every illness is caused by demons. 31 \nimong the long lists of "signs" of demonic possession were the \nflowing: inability to retain food; sensation of weight in the stomach; \nain in the lower belly, kidneys, or head; lassitude; impotence; weaken- \niig or emaciation of the body; fiery pains in the entrails; sudden \nfelling of the stomach; yellowish or pale complexion; melancholia. \n!)emonic possession was the proper diagnosis "if skilled physicians \nre not sure what the affliction is, and cannot form an opinion about it; \nr if the medications prescribed do not help but rather increase the \nickness." 32 Since the medications of the period usually did make the \nick sicker, possession must have been a frequent diagnosis. \n\nAside from its usefulness to physicians, the theory of possession \n/as useful to the possessed themselves. It provided an outlet for \n(idden rage. This psychological function is still seen in groups who \nprmally court possession. In the zar, or demon, cult of modern \nEthiopia, Moslem wives maintain a religion of demonism conducted by \npatrilineal priestesses. It\'s the only religion the women have, where \nven Coptic churches refuse to admit them, and the only feminist \nistitution in the country. An observer reported that the zar cult is \nnormously popular, and most women participate despite opposition \nrom their husbands, "who fear the sexual and economic emancipa- \nion of the wife." 33 \n\nPossession is induced by drumming, chanting, and rhythmic \njfiovement. A woman is "ridden" by her demon or zar, a name \nerhaps traceable all the way back to Osiris Zer. 34 The possessed \n/oman shrieks, babbles, blasphemes, vents her sexual frustrations and \neaps bitter abuse on her husband. She demands new clothes, gifts and \nrnaments, which must be given her, as part of the cure. "The \npidemiology of possession starts a chain of events that enables them \nthe women] to escape from their social confinement" for a while, \nt least. 35 \n\nThe same forces used to operate in Christian society. Oppressed \n/omen used their "demons" to tell the Heavenly Father what they \nlought of him, without incurring the punishment of heretics. Demonic \nossession was the confessional of the dispossessed. \n\nOr again, the same theory of possession was used to excuse sadistic \nehavior. As late as 1895 one Michael Geary of Clonmel, Ireland, \nortured and burned his young wife Bridget on the pretext that she was \nassessed by a devil. 36 With the help of several other men, he poured \n\n\n\n813 \n\n\n\nparaffin over her and set her afire. The men dragged her to the hearth \nand made her sit on the fire, while her husband recited exorcisms. 37 \n\nIn 1966, a Swiss girl named Bernadette Hasler was beaten to death \nby two religious fanatics who claimed they were driving out her \ndemon. Churchmen\'s reaction to this case was interesting. Johannes \nVonderach, bishop of Chur, seemed more concerned about the \nmurderers\' usurpation of clerical prerogatives than about the fact that \nmurder had been done. He announced, "Just as the Church sepa- \nrates itself from superstitious belief in miracles, it rejects a false belief in \nthe Devil. However, as it regards the Devil seriously, on the basis of \nHoly Writ, it places itself doubly under the protection of the crucified \nLord." 38 \n\nThis is a notable example of theological doubletalk, making one \nwonder what can be the difference between "superstitious" belief in \nmiracles and nonsuperstitious belief in miracles; or between "false" \nbelief in the Devil and real belief in the Devil. What for that matter can \nbe the difference between a fanatic who believes in the Devil because \nhe reads the Bible, and a church that "regards the Devil seriously, on \nthe basis of Holy Writ"? In his haste to separate his church from the \ntwo criminals, Vonderach betrayed his own ignorance of Holy Writ. \nJohn said to Jesus, "Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy \nname; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us." Jesus \nanswered, "Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us" \n(Luke 9:49-50). \n\nIn August 1976 the following item appeared in the American \npress: \n\nThe voice on the tapes was that of a woman, but it was unnaturally deep \nand the words were incoherent screams mixed with furious profanities. \nThe tapes recorded the dying days of a timid, 23-year-old epileptic named \nAnnaliese Michel, and they were part of the evidence in a manslaugh- \nter case West German authorities were preparing last week against the \nRoman Catholic Bishop ofWurzburg, Josef Stangl, and two priests he \nappointed to exorcise the Devil from the young woman. When Michel \ndied last month of malnutrition and dehydration, she weighed only 70 \npounds. One of the priests, Father Arnold Renz, maintained that six \ndevils including Nero, Judas, Hitler and Lucifer himself possessed \nMichel and made her refuse to eat. }9 \n\nThat such human tragedies can still occur in a purportedly \nenlightened age is grim proof of the blindness that can be engendered \nby "blind faith." Perhaps the definitive remark on the subject of \npossession was made in 1970 by Dr. Henry Ansgard Kelley of the \nUniversity of California: "Diabolical possession is caused by belief in \ndiabolical possession."\' 10 \n\n1.

She made man in the \nli image of a god, and infused him with the breath of heaven, which \n1 brought him to life. 1 Aruru was also Ishtar, Inanna, Ninhursag, and \nMami, Mama, or Mammitu; she made the first man (Adam) out of \nclay (adamah, the female earth). Assyrians said she made seven clay \nj mother-wombs for females and seven clay mother-wombs for males: \n"The creatress of destiny, in pairs she completed them; the forms of the \npeople Mami forms." 2 \n\nThe biblical story of God\'s creation of Adam out of clay was \nplagiarized from ancient texts with the patriarchs\' usual sex-change of \nthe deity. Mesopotamian flesh-is-clay images were derived from the \nprimitive matriarchate, when all pottery belonged to women. "The \nart of pottery is a feminine invention; the original potter was a woman. \nAmong all primitive peoples the ceramic art is found in the hands of \nwomen, and only under the influence of advanced culture does it \nbecome a man\'s occupation." ? \n\nThe Goddess was worshipped as a Potter in the Jewish temple, \nwhere she received "thirty pieces of silver" as the price of a sacrificial \nvictim (Zechariah 11:13). She owned the Field of Blood, Aceldama, \nwhere clay was moistened with the blood of victims so bought. Judas, \nwho allegedly sold Jesus for this same price, was himself another victim \nof the Potter. In the Potter\'s Field he was either hanged (Matthew \n27:5) or disemboweled (Acts 1:18), suggesting that the Potter was none \nother than the Goddess who both created and destroyed. \n\nIndia\'s Kali Ma was the same creating-and-destroying Goddess, \nwith a special incarnation as Kel Mari the Pot Goddess. 4 Since she \nmade the first man out of clay, her people were Aryans, from arya, \n"man of clay." 5 Kel Mari was related to Mari of Mesopotamia, or \nMariamne, or Miriam, or Mary, whose name was connected with the \ndeaths of both John the Baptist and Jesus. Her earth, which drank the \nblood of sacrificed men, might have been the same Aceldama that drank \nthe blood of Judas. \n\nKali\'s other name Maya was the same as the central American \ncivilization whose women produced remarkable pottery. The oldest \nform of Maya pottery was known as Mamom, "the Grandmother." \nVon Hagen says, "Pottery was woman. All we see of the remains of \nthe Maya ceramic art was done by women. It is a fact that should be \nstressed. In almost every place where pottery making was on an \n\n\n\n815 \n\n\n\nPrakriti archaic level Africa or Melanesia pottery was woman-made and its \n\nPriapus design was woman-inspired. Throughout the area of the Amazon, \n\n^^^^^^^_^^ pottery was a woman\'s task. Women were the potters, so far as we \nknow, in ancient Peru. Early Greek and early Egyptian pottery was \nalso woman-made until the introduction of the potter\'s wheel. ... All \nthe superbly beautiful patterns found on pottery (as well as weaving) \nwere conceived by women." 6 \n\nThe biblical God couldn\'t give birth, so he copied the next best \ncreation technique and molded his first man out of clay, as the \nGoddess did before him. \n\nI.EpicofGilgamesh, 121. 2.

Priapus was a primitive form of Eros, \nbased on the wooden ithyphallic idols worshipped in early Greece, later \ntranslated into stone herms or temple phalli for deflowering brides. 1 \nSee Firstborn. Some of Priapus\'s grotesque images lasted through the \nMiddle Ages, and were even worshipped as saints (see Phallus \nWorship). \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,71. \n\n\n\n816 \n\n\n\nPrisca, Saint Prisca, Saint \n\nMythical "virgin martyr" invented from an icon of the Mother \n\nGoddess with her palm branch in her hand and a lion at her feet. The i^^^^^mmim^^^ \n\nChristian tale claimed that during the reign of Claudius, Prisca was \n\ncondemned to be thrown to the lions for the crime of wanting to \n\npreserve her virginity. Her innocence exuded such powerful magic \n\nthat the beasts refused to eat her, and lay down at her feet like house \n\ncats. Later she was beheaded. 1 Apparently human beings were better \n\nable than lions to resist her charm. \n\nUnfortunately for the legend\'s credibility, Christians weren\'t slain \nin the reign of Claudius. On the contrary, Claudius earnestly wished \nto preserve freedom of religion in his empire, and begged warring \nChristian sects to "stop this destructive and obstinate mutual en- \nmity." 2 Claudius was, however, a devotee of Mother Cybele, who was \npictured on his coins with a lion at her feet, like the original icon of \nSaint Prisca. 3 \n\nThe only human Prisca who might be legitimately connected with \nearly Christianity was a woman believed to have been the real author \nof the Epistle to the Hebrews, sometimes called Priscilla, "Little \nPrisca." 4 There is no evidence that she was ever martyred. \n\n1.

Morris, 121. \n\n\n\nPrometheus \n\nGreek "Forethought," probably not the god\'s original name but the \nnearest vocal equivalent to Sanskrit pramantha, the swastika or fire-drill \nsacred to Agni, the fire god who brought fertility to Kali\'s water \nelement. Prometheus brought fire or "light" to mankind as Lucifer did, \nagainst the will of the Olympian heavenly father. Yet Zeus himself \nappeared as Zeus Prometheus at Thurii, holding a fire-drill. 1 \n\nOne of the Hindu notions of creation was that all things arose from \nthe action of male firesticks (Agni) twirling in the female groove \n(Ambika-Kali). 2 The Sea Dyaks have the same image of sexual creation. \nThey say only one woman survived the Deluge. She made a fire-drill \nand used it as a phallus. By its motion in her body, she conceived the \nhuman race. 3 Such myths obviously date back to the time before \nsemen was credited with the power of conception. One of the early \ntheories of fatherhood was that only sexual "motion" stimulated \nformation of life in the womb. \n\nThe Greeks didn\'t know where Prometheus came from. Diodorus \nsaid he was Egyptian. An Orphic hymn identified him with Saturn. \nLycophron called him "the Ethiopian god Prometheus." 4 He was the \nconsort of Libyan Athene, who gave life to the human beings he \nmolded out of clay (see Potter). From Athene he learned the secrets of \n\n\n\n817 \n\n\n\nPrometheus the civilized arts, and passed them on to his proteges, along with the \n\nstolen "fire from heaven" identified with lightning, or enlightenment, or \n^^^^^^^^^_ godly knowledge that Zeus wished to keep secret from humans. 5 \n\nLike Lucifer, Prometheus disobeyed the heaven-father by being \nmore benevolent toward humanity than he was. Aeschylus\'s Prome- \ntheus Bound plainly showed more sympathy toward the disobedient one \nthan toward the God he offended. Zeus punished Prometheus by \nhaving him chained to a Caucasian mountaintop where his liver was \ndaily devoured by his own totemic eagle and nightly restored to be \ndevoured again. The sea nymphs wailed for Prometheus. The Daugh- \nters of Ocean cursed Zeus as an insolent despot. The other \nlightning-god Hephaestus muttered seditiously, "The mind of Zeus \nknows no turning, and ever harsh the hand that newly grasps the \nsway." \n\nPrometheus himself mused, "I rescued mankind from the heavy \nblow that was to cast them into Hades. . . . Mankind I helped, but I \ncould not help myself." He prophesied Zeus\'s downfall at the hands of \nancient female powers of justice (or karma): "The Fates triform and \nthe unforgetting Furies." He told Io the Moon-cow, also oppressed by \nZeus, that her offspring would be the instrument of Zeus\'s doom. \n\nThe Prometheus myth presaged the Gnostics\' sympathy for Luci- \nfer, who was the same sort of hero a philanthropic anti-god unfairly \npunished for giving "light" or "enlightenment" to humanity. Gnostic \nicons copied early pictures of Prometheus molding the first man out \nof clay while Athene stood waiting to infuse the figure with the spirit of \nlife. Behind her rose a tree encircled by a serpent, totemic symbol of \nher wisdom. 6 The story of Eden was based on just such icons. \n\nAccording to another myth, Prometheus tricked Zeus into accept- \ning the less edible parts of sacrificial animals, such as the fat and \nbones, on behalf of the gods, while human beings were allowed to \nconsume the meat. This was not what Zeus intended, and he swore \nrevenge on both Prometheus and his human friends. 7 Still, he had made \nhis choice and had to stick to it. The biblical Yahweh made the same \nchoice, and so received only the fat and guts of sacrificial animals \n(Leviticus 4) while the priests ate the rest. The Greek sense of humor \nenvisioned Zeus accepting such offal only because he was forced to, \nhaving sworn by the Styx to keep to his choice; but the Jews simply \nclaimed that Yahweh preferred it. \n\nPrometheus was made one of the Titans, the group of gigantic \nearth-spirits who predated Zeus and his Olympian host, and were \ngenerally hostile to them. The battle between Zeus\'s Olympians and the \nTitans, in which the latter were deprived of the status of gods and \nchained under the earth, was one of the prototypes of the Judeo- \nChristian "war in heaven." \n\n1.

Conversely, anyone\'s \niritual authority was dependent on fulfillment of prophecies that \n\nalready been made. This was so important in establishing Christian- \n\\f that the New Testament again and again relates events that were \njne only to fulfill some prophetic text from the Old Testament. By \ntemporary notions, the coming of Jesus or any other spiritual \ner was of no account unless it had been prophesied by a different \nitual leader. \n\nProphets were sometimes carried away by the ecstatic spirit and \nphesied too literally, so the prophecy could be too easily checked, \nus the prophetic God seemed to tell lies. Provision was made for this \nculty in the Bible not to excuse the over-zealous prophet, but to \n:cuse God: "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the \nling follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord \nath not spoken" (Deuteronomy 18:22). Of course this made it \nnpossible to tell, at the time, whether any given prophecy was \nenuine or not; and this rather defeated the whole purpose of prophecy. \n\n\n\nProphecy \nProstitution \n\n\n\n\'rorsa and Postverta \n\nTwo faces of the Etruscan year-goddess Anna Perenna, who looked \norward and backward in Time, therefore ruled both prophecy of the \niiture and history of the past. The Romans masculinized her as \nanus. \n\n\n\nProserpina \n\nRoman version of Persephone, queen of the underworld. Along with \nHecate and Diana, Proserpina was frequently designated "queen of \nwitches" in medieval tradition. Christian Gnostics spoke of her as the \ndeath-goddess whom every soul would meet soon after death. Christian \ndemonologists listed Proserpina among the dignitaries of hell, as the \n"arch she-devil." 1 She had a poetic appeal however for such as Swin- \nburne, who said she "gathers all things mortal with cold immortal \nhands"; and in her mystic garden there was "only the sleep eternal in an \neternal night." 2 \n\n1. de Givry, 141. 2. Swinburne, TTie Garden of Proserpine. \n\n\n\nvar. Proserpine \n\n\n\nProstitution \n\nLike the devadasis of Hindu temples, prostitute-priestesses dispensed \nthe grace of the Goddess in ancient Middle-Eastern temples. They \n\n\n\n819 \n\n\n\nProstitution \n\n\n\nAs Mother of \nHarlots, Ishtar was \ncalled the Great \nGoddess HAR. Her \nhigh priestess the \nHarine was spiritual \nruler of "the city of \nIshtar." 4 HAR was a \ncognate of the \nPersian houri and the \nGreek Hora, also the \norigin of "harem," \nwhich used to mean \na Temple of Women, \nor a sanctuary. 5 A \nsimilar meaning was \nonce attached to \nseraglio, from Semitic \nserai, a shrine of \nqueens. \n\n\n\nwere often known as Charites or Graces, since they dealt in the \nunique combination of beauty and kindness called chads (Latin caritas) \nthat was later translated "charity." Actually it was like Hindu karuna, \na combination of mother-love, tenderness, comfort, mystical enlighten- \nment, and sex. \n\nHesiod said the sensual magic of the sacred whores or Horae \n"mellowed the behavior of men." 1 Ishtar, the Great Whore of \nBabylon, announced, "A prostitute compassionate am I." 2 Mary Mag- \ndalene said of her sisters in the profession, "Not only are we \ncompassionate of ourselves, but we are compassionate of all the race of \nmankind." 3 \n\nAncient harlots often commanded high social status and were \nrevered for their learning. 6 As embodiments of the Queen of Heav- \nen, in Palestine called Qadeshet, the Great Whore, the harlots were \nhonored like queens at centers of learning in Greece and Asia \nMinor. 7 Some even became queens. The empress Theodora, wife of \nJustinian, began her career as a temple harlot. 8 St. Helena, mother of \nConstantine, was a harlot before she became an empress-saint. 9 \n\nIn an Egyptian story, a priestess of Bubastis demanded all of a \nman\'s worldly goods for one night of her love. She said, "I am a \nhierodule; I am no mean person." 10 Until recently Egypt still had a class \nof women called ghazye, "sacred whores," who were greatly honored \nin the time of the Mamelukes and prized as brides when their period of \nservice was ended. 11 \n\nTemple prostitutes were revered as healers of the sick. Their very \nsecretions were supposed to have medical virtue. A Sufi proverb still \nsuggests this opinion: "There is healing in a woman\'s vagina." 12 Even } \ntheir spittle could perform cures. Jesus\'s cure of blindness by spittle \n(Mark 8:23) was copied from a matriarchal tradition. A clay tablet from \nNineveh says eye diseases can be cured by a harlot\'s spittle. 15 Harlots \nwere also sorceresses, prophets, and seers. The Hebrew word zonah \nmeans both a prostitute and a prophetess. 14 \n\nHoly Mothers designated the promiscuous priestess-shamanesses \nof Japan, also known as spirit-women. Becoming Brides of God, they \nentered the shrine to lie with a priest possessed by the god\'s spirit. 15 \nSimilar customs distinguished the Indian devadasis, human copies of \nthe lascivious Heavenly Nymphs. \n\nThe profession was popular. Temples of Aphrodite at Eryx, \nCorinth, Cyprus, and other sites were served by a thousand sacred \nharlots apiece. 16 When Hellenic Greeks reduced wives to the status of \nservants, the hetaerae or courtesans remained legally and politically \nequal to men. Roman matrons of the highest aristocracy prostituted \nthemselves in the temple of Juno Sospita when a revelation was \nneeded. 17 Every Babylonian woman prostituted herself in the temple \nbefore marriage. 18 By Amorite sacred law, "she who was about to \nmarry should sit in fornication seven days by the gate (of the temple)." 19 \nSuch laws were supposed to appease the Goddess, who disapproved \n\n\n\n820 \n\n\n\nof monogamy in the era when there was no formal marriage and Prostitution \n\nchildren didn\'t know their fathers. 20 In Greek myth, the Great \n\nMother forbade the Heavenly Father Zeus to make a monogamous ^^^^^^^^^^^ m \n\nmarriage, holding that only her own ancient system of group mar- \nriage was honorable. 21 \n\nThe Tantric word for a sacred harlot was Veshya, probable origin \nof the Goddess\'s oldest names in Greece and Rome, Hestia or Vesta, \nthe Hearth-mother, served by the Vestal Virgins who were originally \nharlot-priestesses. 22 "Hearth" and "Earth" both arose from the altar \nof the Saxon Goddess Ertha, or Heartha, the northern Hestia- Vesta. In \nthe matriarchal age, every woman\'s hearth-fire was her altar. 23 The \nhearth was also the omphalos, feminine hub of the universe, navel-stone \nof the temple, around which the sacred harlots performed their \nDances of Time. \n\nDancing harlots came to be called Hours: Persian houri, Greek \nhorae. Egyptian temple-women also were Ladies of the Hour. Each \nruled a certain hour of the night, and protected the solar boat of Ra in \nthe underworld during his passage through her hour. 24 The Dance of \nthe Hours began as a pagan ceremony of the Horae (divine "Whores") \nwho kept the hours of the night by dances, as Christian monks later \nkept the hours of the day by prayers. The oldest authentic Hebrew folk \ndance is still called hora after the circle dances of the sacred harlots. \nThe Horae also guarded the gates of heaven, ministered to the souls of \nthe blessed, and turned the heavenly spheres. 25 (See Houri.) \n\nThe Hebrew word hor means a hole, cave, or pit, common \nsynonyms for both a sacred prostitute and the Goddess she served, \nwhose yoni was represented by a hole, cave, pit, or pool of water in the \nheart of the temple. 26 A similar Latin term was puteus, a well or pit, \nsource of the Spanish puta, "whore." Common folk the Romans buried \nin puticuli, "pits," which like all graves used to stand for the womb of \nrebirth. 27 The common root was Vedic puta, "pure" or "holy," and the \nAvestan putika, a mystical lake of the waters of birth. 28 "Lady of the \nLake" was a title of the Great Goddess throughout Eurasia. In Aramaic, \nher shrines were Athra qaddisa, "the holy place," literally a "heavenly \nharlot-place," or genital pit or lake. 29 \n\n"To dive into water means to delve into the mystery of Maya, to \nquest after the ultimate secret of life. . . . [T]he cosmic waters are at \nonce the immaculate source of all things and dreadful grave." 30 All \nAsia called water a female element, the source of creation, the archeoi \nStoic philosophy. To dive into such water was a symbol of sexual \nintercourse. Communing in this way with a holy whore, man could \nrealize the spiritual enlightenment called horasis. This word appears \nin the New Testament (Acts 2:17), misleadingly translated "visions." 31 \n\nA Semitic clan, the Horites of Genesis 36, traced their descent \nfrom the Great Goddess as "Hora." 32 The Jews had cult prostitutes \nin the time of King Josiah, when they lived next to the temple and wove \nhangings for the sacred grove (2 Kings 23:7). Modern translations of \n\n\n\n821 \n\n\n\nProstitution \n\n\n\nNauplia Ancient \ncity near Argos in the \nPeloponnese, site of \nHera\'s sacred spring \nCanathos. \n\nPausanias Greek \ntraveler and geographer \nof the 2nd century \na.d. Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the an- \ncient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nthe Bible call them "sodomites," but the original wording meant holy \nharlots." Such holy harlots were often "brides of God," set apart to \ngive birth to Sons of God, i.e., prophets and sometimes sacrificial \nvictims.\' 4 \n\nHoly whores were called "virgins" because they remained unmar- \nried (see Virgin Birth). Like medieval nuns, they took veils as a \nbadge of their office. Ishtar-Asherah-Mari-Anath was not only the Great \nWhore but also the Great Virgin (kadesha, holy one). Her Greek \nname was Athene, also described as a "virgin" (Parthenia); but Athene\'s \ntemple, the Parthenon, was served by promiscuous hierodules like all \nother shrines of the Goddess. Later myths rationalized the perpetual \n"virginity" of lascivious fertility-goddesses by periodic hymen-renewing \nceremonies such as sea baptism, annual bathing in sacred springs, etc. \nThe virginity of Great Mother Hera was annually restored by a dip in \nthe spring of Canathos at Nauplia. Pausanias said the myth was based \non a rite of bathing the Goddess\'s image. 35 \n\nBecause whores occupied a significant position in paganism, Chris- \ntians vilified their profession. Churchmen didn\'t want to stamp out \nprostitution altogether, only amputate its spiritual meanings. St. John \nChrysostom earned high praise from the Patriarch of Constantinople \nfor robbing temple prostitutes of "the honors paid to them." 36 The triad \nof heavenly Horae were mythically virginized as three maiden saints \nmartyred together, Agape, Chionia, and Irene (Love-feast, She of \nChios, and Peace). 37 Real horae were relegated to hora-houses, no \nlonger temples. The traditional red light of the whorehouse descended \nfrom the houses of Roman venerii who displayed the sign of an erect \nphallus, painted blood red. 38 \n\nMedieval Germanic law forbade a man to build a horgr, or to call \nhis house a horgr, on pain of forfeiting every penny he owned; \nbecause horgr meant a pagan shrine, a house of "holy whores" where \npriestesses carried on the old religion. Such place names as Horgsholt \nin Iceland still identify ancient shrines. 39 \n\nIn the year 1000 a.d. the Icelanders agreed to become Christian in \nname at least, and to be baptized; but all who wished were still legally \npermitted to celebrate the rites of their ancestors in private houses called \nhorgr, for a while, until the church rescinded its promises of toler- \nance. 40 In earlier centuries, the horgr seems to have been a mons \nveneris or omphalos in a sacred grove. 41 \n\nSometimes the alternate word hus (house) carried the same sense \nof "a place of worship," because every matriarch once worshipped \nthe Goddess of her own hearth, which she could share with more than \none hus-band. Hence the word hussy, Lady of the House, by \nChristian definition a promiscuous woman. 42 \n\nPromiscuity was appreciated, rather than deplored, by medieval \nminnesingers who worshipped the Goddess under her new name of \nMinne, "Love." They objected to commercialized prostitution as a \ndegradation of their deity: "Love, the queen of all hearts, the free- \n\n\n\n822 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nborn, the one and only, is put up for public sale! What a shameful Prostitution \n\ntribute is this that our mastery has required of her! We cultivate Love \n\nwith embittered minds, with lies, and with deceit, and then expect from ^mammm^^^mmi^^ \nher joy of body and heart; but instead, she bears only pain, corrup- \ntion, evil fruit, and blight as her soil was sown." 4 * \n\nTheologians however accepted commercial prostitution as "a law- \nful immorality," in St. Thomas Aquinas\'s self-contradictory phrase. \nAquinas said prostitution was necessary to prevent men from sodomiz- \ning each other: "Take away prostitutes from the world," he said, "and \nyou will fill it with sodomy." 44 Prostitution enabled man to look upon \npromiscuous women as depraved, though their equally promiscuous \nclients were seen as helpless victims of compulsion. There was no \nrecognition of the truth, that most prostitutes acted under a more \ntelling compulsion than any man\'s sexuality: the need to earn where- \nwithal to keep alive. It was not an easy living. At best the prostitute \nwas forced to make herself a stranger\'s abject servant. At worst, she \ncould become his tormented victim. 45 \n\nCertain anticlerical writers maintained that prostitutes should be \nrespected for their willingness to be kind. Lorenzo Valla\'s 1 5th- \ncentury De Voluptate called for a return to ancient customs, echoing \nHorace\'s Omnia voluptas bona est Valla wrote: "Whores and \nprostitutes deserve more from the human race than do nuns with their \nchastity and virginity!" 46 Of course, such sentiments did not prevail. \nTwo centuries later, English apprentices celebrated each Shrove Tues- \nday by breaking into whorehouses and beating the inmates. It also \nbecame customary in England for men to "punish" the whores they \npatronized by hamstringing: cutting the sinews of the legs to make \nthe woman a permanent cripple. 47 One might be reminded of the \nChinese custom of crippling courtesans by footbinding. \n\nGod punished the whores in hell even more severely than men \npunished them on earth, according to God\'s spokesmen, whose \nasceticism engendered sexual fantasies of astonishing violence. 48 Monk- \nish deprivations and repressions led to secret envy and fierce hatred of \nthe carnal folk who might be suspected of enjoying sexual activity. 49 \nThe hatred poured out in a thousand nasty fantasies of hell. Abbe \nFrancois Arnoux, canon of Riez in 1622, provides an example: \n\n\n\nAnd the light women, these shall have in their arms a dragon most cruel, \nflaming with Are . . . who shall bind and enchain their feet and their \nlegs with his serpent tail and shall clasp their whole body with his cruel \ntalons, who shall put his beslabbered and reeking mouth upon theirs, \nbreathing therein flames of Are and sulphur and poison and venom, who \nwith his nose, glandered and hideous, shall breathe into theirs a breath \nmost stinking and venomous . . . this dragon shall make them suffer a \nthousand agonies, a thousand colics and bitter twistings of the belly, and \nall the damned shall howl, and the devils with them, "See the wanton! see \nthe strumpet! Let her be tortured indeed! To it, to it, ye devils! To it, \nye demons! To it, ye hellish furies! See the harlot! See the trull! Hurl ye \nupon this whore and wreak upon her all the torments ye can! " so \n\n\n\n823 \n\n\n\nProstitution \n\n\n\nKastoria The ancient \nCeletrum, a town \nand nome in Greek \nMacedonia. \n\n\n\nOn the wall of the women\'s section of the Church of St. John \nthe Baptist in Kastoria, a painting showed God\'s punishment of a \nwhore. Bound in hell, the woman had her legs stretched apart by two \ndemons, while a third demon plunged red-hot irons into her vagina. \nNext to the woman punished for being sexually available, another \nwoman labeled the Vain Coquette was similarly punished for nor being \nsexually available. 51 Women attending this church might well be \nexcused for thinking they were damned if they did and damned if they \ndidn\'t. \n\nChurchmen did not distinguish between a professional prosti- \ntute and a woman in love with a lover. Both were "whores." The whole \npoint of patriarchal morality was that women must not have the right \nto pick and choose men. For a woman to fall passionately in love was a \ntragedy under the medieval church: to pay for a few stolen hours of \nlove, both she and her lover were doomed to an eternity of suffering. 52 \nThe point was illustrated by Grunewald\'s painting The Damnation \nof Lovers, showing a sinful pair as emaciated corpses living in hell, with \nworms burrowing through their flesh, the woman crowned with a \ncoiled serpent, her genitals gnawed by a toad. According to a 1 5th- \ncentury illustration for St. Augustine\'s De Civitate Dei, lovers would \nbe bound together on spits in hell and roasted over coals fanned by \ndevils. 53 \n\nWith western religion envisioning such grisly punishments for \nsexual enjoyment, it is hardly surprising to find western civilization as \na whole seized by a sick compulsion to destroy all forms of pleasure. 54 \nEven in the Christian heaven however, whores had their special \nprotectors, modeled on pagan Roman harlot-goddesses like Venus \nand Meretrix. Official Catholic patrons of whores were St. Aphra, St. \nAphrodite, and St. Maudline (Magdalen), simple canonizations of \nformer titles of the Goddess. 55 Chief protectress of whores was the \nvirgin Mary. In Antwerp up to the present century, prostitutes spent \ncertain annual feast days marching in procession to the churches, to \ndedicate candles to the Holy Virgin whom they called their own \nspecial deity. 56 \n\nAn oft-told tale of the Middle Ages said when a nun decided to \nrun away from her convent, to live as a prostitute for a few days, \nMary assumed the errant nun\'s appearance and took her place in the \nconvent, so she wouldn\'t be missed and pursued. 57 A German variant \nof the story said the nun, Beatrix, left the convent to live with her \nheathen lover for 1 5 years. When she returned, she found that Mary \nhad served as her stand-in all the while. 58 \n\nMedieval brothels were not always clearly distinguished from \nconvents. A trace of the pagan collegia of priestesses still clung to \nboth institutions. Early "double convents," with men and women \nunited in one community, sometimes housed consecrated prostitutes. \nSeveral popes maintained "holy brothels" in Rome; Queen Joanna of \n\n\n\n824 \n\n\n\nle her c \n\n\n\nb \n\n\n\nNaples founded a religious house of prostitutes called The Abbey in Prostitution \n\nthe papal city of Avignon. In Victorian times, it was still a common \n\ncustom to call the madam of a whorehouse "the abbess," though the ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhistorical precedent was forgotten. 59 See Mary Magdalene. \n\nOutside the Judeo-Christian tradition, prostitution often became a \nfully legitimate lifestyle. Black Africans never fully accepted mission- \naries\' views on the matter. White men\'s laws deprived African women \nof their property and their monopoly of farming, trading, and crafts \ny which they supported their children. African women suffered a \n\nstating loss of self-respect, for in their society a woman without \ner own income was regarded with contempt. On finding that white \nmen would pay for their sexual favors, many African women took up \nprostitution as their last remaining chance to make an honest living. \nAfricans still regard a successful prostitute as a usefully employed \nbusinesswoman rather than a criminal. 60 \n\nBy contrast, Christian society seldom offered women any formal \npportunity to take up prostitution as a career, but half-deliberately \nlooked the other way as many hundreds of young girls "fell" into it. \nEighteenth-century London swarmed with female children strug- \ngling to keep themselves alive by prostitution, according to a \ncontemporary pamphlet denouncing "little Creatures piled in Heaps \nupon one another, sleeping in the public streets, in the most rigorous \nseasons, and some of them whose Heads will hardly reach above the \nWaistband of a Man\'s Breeches, found to be quick with Child, and \nbecome burdensome to the Parish." Far from extending sympathy to \nthese little girls, the pamphleteer called them wicked whores, "a most \nenormous Sin to lay Snares for the Unwary, and to be the Means of \nruining both Souls and Bodies of so many innocent young \nGentlemen." 61 \n\nAccording to the terminology of the time, a "wench" was a child \nof either sex. Dryden\'s description of a gentleman as one who "eats, \ndrinks, and wenches abundantly" apparently meant a man who picked \nup homeless male or female children in the streets to service his \nsexual idiosyncrasies. Later, "wench" came to mean only a lower-class \nfemale, a servant or peasant available for a gentleman\'s sexual use. 62 \n\nBy the 19th century, thousands of girls under the age of 14 were \nlisted on English police registers as "common prostitutes." London in \n1860 had at least 500 registered prostitutes under the age of 1 3, and \n1 500 more under the age of 16. Victorian gentlemen had a taste for \nraping child virgins, who commanded the highest prices in whore- \nhouses. Experienced child whores were taught to imitate the cries \nand struggles of a newly deflowered victim, and to insert leeches or \nbroken glass into their vaginas to produce a convincing flow of \nblood. 63 \n\nJosephine Butler\'s investigations of the English system of prostitu- \ntion led to legislation to raise the "age of consent" to 14; still, large \n\n\n\n825 \n\n\n\nProvidence numbers of younger girls were captured and immured in brothels. "The ! \n\nPsyche law was lax on the matter of abduction, and the punishment for \n\n.____ _^__^_ trafficking in girls was derisory." Male authorities took an interest in \nprostitution only after they clearly understood its connection with \nrampant venereal disease. Legal regulation of brothels was instituted \nthen; but this didn\'t mean closing them. It meant subjecting them to \nmedical inspections, so they would be safe for male patrons. 64 \n\nWhores were not considered full-fledged human beings. The \n18th-century term for a whore was "a fleshy convenience." 65 The \nword "convenience" also meant an outhouse. One might say that from \nthe revered sacred harlot of antiquity to this was a long road \nbackward. \n\n1. Lamusse, 138. 2. Briffault 3, 169. 3. Malvern, 49. 4. Assyr. &Bab. Lit, 170. \n5.

In Christian usage, Providence was sometimes a \nsynonym for God; but many mystics defined Providence as a female \ndeity. 2 \n\n1. Funk, 275. 2.

Classical myth \nwedded Psyche to the love-god Eros: a union of soul with body. \nApuleius\'s version said Psyche and her bridegroom could come \ntogether only in the dark. When Psyche insisted on seeing Eros by the \nlight of her lamp, he had to leave her forever. 1 As an allegory, this \nsaid the passion of the soul might banish sexual passion.

"Sometimes children Pudens, Pudenziana \n\nwere born before the pair had ever seen each other\'s faces by day." 2 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nPsyche was incarnate in a butterfly, for the early Greeks believed \nhuman souls could occupy flying insects while passing from one life \nto the next. The belief was not forgotten. At Carcassonne in 1 329 an \namorous Carmelite monk was accused of witchcraft for hiding love \ncharms in women\'s houses. It was charged that he also called up Satan \nand sacrificed a butterfly to him, in symbolic offering of the soul. 3 \n\n1. E. Hamilton, 92-100. 2. Crawley, 42. 3. J. B.

According to the Christian legend, \nPudenziana was the usual virgin convert, a daughter of Pudens, a \nwealthy patrician. Peter and Paul lodged in the house of Pudenziana on \ntheir (mythical) visit to Rome. With the help of a holy man named \nPastorus (Shepherd), St. Pudenziana soaked up the blood of Christian \nmartyrs in sponges, which she hid in a well. 1 This tale was often cited \nto account for the numerous bottles of martyrs\' blood used as healing \nrelics in countless churches. \n\nThe well with its holy blood probably meant the yonic "pit" \niputeus) in the Forum, where the spirits of blessed ancestors dwelt. \nThe Shepherd Pastorus was a form of the Psychopomp or Conductor of \nSouls, sometimes called Shepherd of the Stars. \n\n1. Brewster, 250-51. \n\n\n\n827 \n\n\n\nPurgatory Purgatory \n\nOne of several Christian doctrines derived more or less directly from \n^i^""^"^""" Buddhism. Five centuries before the Christian era, Buddhist priests \nclaimed to be able to deliver one\'s ancestors from pains of atonement \nin the underworld and to cause them to be born again in heaven, by \nreciting magic words and performing sacrifices on their behalf for a \nfee paid by the pious descendant. 1 "Above all," Buddhist scriptures said, \n"it is necessary to obtain the aid of priests who deliver these bound \nsouls by the ritual." 2 \n\nThe Christian doctrine of purgatory implied that priests had the \npower to send to heaven individuals who might otherwise have been \ndamned. Some stories hinted that the privilege could be carried too far. \nPope Gregory the Great succeeded in praying the emperor Trajan \nout of purgatory and into heaven, but God punished Gregory with gout, \nfever, and stomach pains for his sin of praying for a heathen. 3 \n\nThe Catholic notion of purgatory was renounced by Protestants, \nwho were scornful of anything resembling the sale of salvation. \nReginald Scot remarked that in England the ghosts no longer pestered \nthe living to be prayed out of purgatory: "Where are the spirits? Who \nheareth their noises? Who seeth their visions? Where are the souls that \nmade such moan ... to be eased of their pains in purgatory?" He \nconcluded that they had all gone to Italy, because masses had become \ntoo expensive in England. 4 \n\nThe word purgatory was often applied to the pagan womb-shrine \nor abaton used in initiations in pre-Christian times (see Abaddon). A \ncandidate would "descend into an underground chamber, simulate \ndeath, undergo great trials, and experience a rebirth into a new life. \nThe early Christian Church continued this custom, calling such pagan \nshrines \'purgatories.\' The most celebrated purgatory during medieval \ntimes was the one at Lough Derg (Red Lake) in County Donegal, \nIreland, to which pilgrimages were made in the twelfth century in \nhonor of St. Patrick, for whom the purgatory was named." Though \nPope Alexander VI declared it a residence of devils and ordered it \nclosed in 1497, St. Patrick\'s Purgatory was still in use in 1790. 5 \n\nAccording to a 1 5th-century illustration for the Divine Comedy, \npurgatory was not a pit or cave but a mountain, constructed in \nwedding-cake levels very like a ziggurat. At the summit was the Earthly \nParadise, where a nude male and female figure were joined together \nin a sacred marriage: a peculiar link between the ancient King and \nGoddess mating at the pinnacle of the ziggurat, and the conventional \nbride-and-groom dolls on the wedding cake. 6 The implication of the \npicture was that, once the sinner had expurgated his sins and moved \nup the stages of the mountain, he too could enter the love-paradise at \nthe top: a strange image for a Christian article of faith. \n\n1.

Yahweh \nis never mentioned in the Book of Esther, because the Elamite Jews \ndidn\'t know him. They worshipped Ishtar\'s spouse Marduk, who \nappears in the book as Mordecai. \n\nPurim is the Feast of Lots, because the original Elamite festival \nwas based, in turn, on the Hittite Purulli, where a sacred-king-victim \nwas chosen by casting lots, or by a competition. 1 The victim in the \nJewish Purim was Haman, the same as the Libyan sacrificial god \nAmon. \n\nHaman lay with the Goddess, Ishtar-Esther, then was slain by \nMarduk-Mordecai (Esther 7:8). Afterward, his flesh was sacramental- \nly eaten, as he is still eaten symbolically at Purim in the form of \nhamantaschen, small triangular pastries in the Goddess\'s sacred delta \nshape. Egyptian bakers made similar three-cornered cakes to represent \nthe Host or victim in festivals of Amon. 2 \n\nThe story of Esther is an allegorical tale of the intercession of \nIshtar, whom the Jews worshipped at the time, with the king who was \nsupposed to be her consort, on behalf of the subject Jewish tribes. \nInterwoven with this theme is that of the ritual sacrifice. Haman was \ngiven a Last Supper and a night of the Goddess-queen\'s love. Then he \nwas hanged on the high gallows that was "prepared for Mordecai" \nthat is, he became the god Marduk and assumed the trappings of \ndivinity (Esther 7:10). \n\nThe Jews also worshipped Marduk, who had originally "divided \nthe waters which were under the firmament from the waters which \nwere above the firmament" (Genesis 1 :7) by splitting the Water-mother \nTiamat. In the Book of Esther, Jewish scribes made Marduk one of \ntheir own sacred ancestors. Marduk helped the Jews kill 75,000 of their \nenemies, apparently by magic, for they "laid not their hands on the \nprey" (Esther 9:16). \n\n1. Hooke, M.E.M., 99. 2. Budge, D.N., 75. \n\n\n\nPurple \n\nFrom Latin purpureus, "very, very holy," or sacer, or taboo. 1 The \nancients\' "royal purple" was not purple but a dark wine red, the color of \nblood, especially the menstrual blood formerly considered the very \nstuff of life. Royal purple meant the same as royal blood: matrilineal \nkinship in a sacred clan. Some legends said royal purple descended \nfrom Athene\'s "goatskin dyed red," the aegis of sovereignty. 2 The \npurple robe of a Roman emperor was said to have been "colored by \nblood." 3 Purple still meant blood color in the time of Shakespeare, who \n\n\n\nPurple \n\n\n\n829 \n\n\n\nPurusha \nPyerun \n\n\n\nFirst Book of \n\nAdam and Eve One of \n\nthe legendary \napocrypha (works \nwritten in Greek \nfrom Jewish sources) \ngiving additional \ndetails or alternative \nversions of the \nGenesis myths. \n\n\n\nspoke of the "purpled hands" of Caesar\'s assassins, stained with "the \nmost noble blood of all the world." \n\nWhen Mark\'s Gospel says Jesus\'s robe was purple (15:17) and \nMatthew\'s Gospel says it was scarlet (27:28), they are really talking \nabout the conventional sacred-king robe of moon-blood-color. Babylo- \nnian kings wore the same dark-red robe, called lamhussu. It was the \nsame sacred blood color that covered altars in Canaan and Israel \n(Numbers 4), and dyed the "red carpet" trod by triumphal religious \nprocessions/ \n\nBlood-purple was sacred to the pagans, as suggested by the First \nBook of Adam and Eve, which says the art of dyeing crimson and \npurple was invented by Satan. 5 \n\nActually, the art was invented by the Phoenicians, who obtained \ndeep-blood-red dye from mollusks of the family Muricidae. These sea \nsnails were the source of the famous "Tyrian purple" worn by royalty. 6 \nIn Roman society, people just below imperial rank were allowed to \nwear stripes or borders of the holy color on their togas, in smaller widths \naccording to a descending scale of status. \n\n1.

The earth plane lay \nat her waist, seven concentric hells below in the pelvis, seven more in \nthe legs. Fourteen corresponding heavens mounted through the thorax \nand head: 28 in all, like the 14 levels descended by Osiris on his way \nto the Pit, and 14 more ascended into heaven one night for each \nmaking a full lunar cycle. Egyptian priests said the World Body was \nthe Goddess Neith. 1 However, ascetic Jain Buddhists rendered the \nPurusha sexually neutral. Later, medieval Europe adopted the idea \nbut made the World Body wholly male. 2 \n\nThe highest heaven, which Greeks called the Empyrean, spread as \na shining umbrella over the head of Purusha. On the earth plane, \ncontinents and oceans were arranged in concentric rings, like a horizon- \ntal target. 3 This image was still found in medieval geographies. \n\n1 . Budge, G.E. 2, 299. 2.

Pygmies still live as they did 3000 years ago, in the jungle near \nthe Ruwenzori Range (Mountains of the Moon). This area was \nrendered virtually inaccessible from the north when climatic changes \ncreated a vast swamp, now known as the Sudd, between Nilotic \ncivilizations and the mountain headwaters. But in an earlier age, \nAfrica\'s topography was more congenial to travel and colonization. \n\nPygmies say their ancestors came from the northern land of Kimi, \na Coptic name for Egypt, derived from Khemennu, "Land of the \nMoon." The pygmies\' culture hero Efe was sometimes called Heru, an \nold Egyptian name for Horus. He was crucified on a World Tree, \nand received a revelation of holy law from a lunar spirit named Mara, \nthe old pygmy name for a tribal matriarch, then for any divine \npersonage. 1 \n\nLike their relatives the Bushmen, pygmies are caucasoid people: \nthin-lipped, light-skinned, often blue-eyed. Anthropological investiga- \ntions show the pygmies were not true primitives but remnants of a \nformerly sophisticated race, the proto-Berber people inhabiting what \nHallet called "old white Africa." 2 Pygmies have about the same stature \nas Egyptian mummies; the ancient Egyptians were not large people. \n\nEgypt had a pygmy god, Bes, patron of music, dancing, and \nentertainment. He seems to have been an imported court jester to the \ngods. "They delighted in his grotesque figure and contortions, just as \nthe Memphite Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom enjoyed the antics of \ntheir pygmies." Bes became almost as popular as Osiris. He protected \nwomen, especially pregnant ones. He preserved families, looked after \nthe dead in the underworld, and attended the infant sun god at his birth. \nLater, Bes was diabolized along with all other Egyptian deities. He \nwas called a "wicked demon\' exorcised by Moses. He is said to dwell still \nin the southern gate of the temple of Karnak, whence he threatens \nsolitary travelers. 3 \n\nPygmies retain matriarchal traditions from their original source. \nThey say the first human beings were made by the moon. The first \nwoman, Mother of God, was Matu (Mother), who still dwells in caverns \n\n\n\n831 \n\n\n\nP V ntia under the Mountains of the Moon. Sometimes she was seen as a cat- \n\nPython headed deity like Egypt\'s Bast. Her name was a cognate of Maat and \n\n^^^^^^^^^ also of the Sumerian Matu, the primal womb, the underworld, and \n^"^^^^^^^^^ the devourer of the dead. In Babylon the Death-goddess Matu was also \nLilith, or the yonic lotus lilu. Now the pygmies say their Goddess can \ntake the form of a monster named Lulu, with a vast vulva-mouth that \nopens vertically instead of horizontally, and swallows human beings \nheadfirst. 4 \n\nNot only are the pygmy myths and deities derived from those of \nthe ancient world, but their traditional stories plainly speak of the time \nwhen their ancestors lived in a high state of civilization, in great cities, \nwith wonderful tools to use, and skills that enabled them to work \nmiracles. 5 \n\nThe true origin of these people cannot be known precisely, any \nmore than the origin of any other nonliterate group. Yet it seems \nclear that they did have a connection with Nilotic culture at a very early \ndate, possibly even as colonial villages along the upper reaches of the \nNile. Even in dynastic Egypt there were half-forgotten stories about the \n"true source" of the Nile at the Goddess\'s lunar mountain with its \nvast uterine cave. Later the ceremonial source of the Nile was located at \nElephantine, because it became too difficult to travel upriver beyond \nthis point. In the end, the pygmies were cut off. \n\n1.

Like \nthe serpent-and-dove deities of Mesopotamia, he combined avian and \nreptilian attributes; he was called the Feathered Serpent. \n\nHe gave blood from his penis to re-create the human race after the \nFlood and so became one of the "castrated Fathers." l He was \nsacrificed; he descended into hell; he rose again from the dead. His \nSecond Coming was expected. \n\nLike the dead and living Shiva, like Njord and Frey, Horus and \nSet, Apollo and Python, etc., Quetzalcoatl was a two-faced deity of \ncreation and destruction, united back to back with his brother Death. 2 \nNorth American Indians also worshipped the same alternating rival \ngods as the White Manitu and the Dark Manitu, lords of life and death. \nThey were alternately sons or husbands of the Great Goddess whom \nthe tribes named Divine Grandmother. 3 Aztecs called her the Lady of \nthe Serpent Skirt, receiver of Quetzalcoatl\'s sacrifice. \n\n1.

Worshippers of Aphrodite taught that the "essential fifth" \ncame to a man during the lunar month called honey-moon, planned to \nspan a menstrual period. Aphrodite\'s nectar was also called honey. \nHorace said the kiss that sealed the marriage bond was mixed by \nAphrodite with "a fifth part of her own nectar." 2 Homer said the \nblood that flowed in the veins of gods was a blue ethereal fluid, ichor, \nprepared by Aphrodite\'s honeybees. 3 \n\nThis blue essence evolved from a confused memory of Indo- \nEuropean ancestral gods made immortal by their blue blood. Hindu \ngods are still painted blue in sacred art which may shed light on the \ncustom of the Picts and other early British tribes to paint themselves \nblue with woad for religious ceremonies, and sometimes for warfare, to \ninsure their resurrection in case of death in battle. 4 \n\nThe blue-blooded god filled with quintessence was well known to \nGnostic thinkers. Porphyry said the Demiurge or creator of the \nmaterial world was shaped like a man, with a dark blue complexion, \nexactly like Shiva, Vishnu, and other Hindu gods. 5 Aristotle taught \nthat quintessence was a fifth element after earth, water, air, and fire \nof which the bodies of gods were made. Sometimes this fifth element \nwas said to be the same as ether, the fluid of heaven. 6 \n\nMedieval alchemists described the quinta essentia as a blue elixir, \nable to confer spiritual illumination and resurrection of the body. 7 \nLater, the mystic Essential Fifth was represented by the fifth trump suit \nof the Tarot deck, the Major Arcana (Great Secrets), whose figures \nconveyed mystical doctrines to the initiated. \n\n1.

His \norigins were greatly confused by his own priests, who called him the \nsupreme deity, though the Goddess\'s priests insisted that Ra was only \nher dependent child. Many scriptures demonstrate the ideological \nbattle. \n\nDuring the Ptolemaic period, some of Ra\'s votaries rejected the \nidea that Ra was born of the Mother of the Gods; they called him \n"self-begotten and self-born." 2 A hymn addressed him as "divine \ndivinity, that came into being of himself, primeval god, that existed at \nthe beginning." But this passage was an interpolation. The same hymn \nalso said, "Thou art fair, O Ra, every day thy mother Nut embraceth \nthee." 3 \n\n\n\n837 \n\n\n\nRa One source called Ra "the divine man-child, the heir of eternity, \n\nself-begotten and self-born"; but the same source also said he was \n\n^^^^^^^^^_ "the Disc within thy mother Hathor . . . made strong each day by thy \nmother Nut." Sometimes, Ra\'s divinity depended on identifying him \nwith the Mother herself. He was told, "Thou art indeed Isis," or "Thou \nart the Great Cat," i.e., the Goddess Bast-Hathor. 4 \n\nSome writers mocked Ra\'s pretensions to divinity and considered \nhim subordinate to the Goddess Mother. He was "born yesterday \nfrom the buttocks of the goddess Mehurt ... the Great Celestial Wa- \nter." He was told, "Thy mother brought thee forth upon her hand." \nApparently the average Egyptian wouldn\'t tolerate priestly efforts to \nerase the Goddess and replace her with the kings\' solar Father. \nBudge says, "it is quite certain that there was something in the doctrines \nof the priests of Ra, or in the worship that was the practical expression \nof them, which was contrary to the instincts of the Egyptians as a \nnation." 5 \n\nWrestling with the problem of bringing their god into being \nwithout a mother, Ra\'s priests took refuge in abstractions beyond the \nunderstanding of ordinary folk: "The god hath formed himself and his \nform is not known.

 = part_4 = 

He hath joined his seed with his body, so that his \negg existed in his secret self. ... He had no mother, who might have \ngiven him his name. ... He who hath shaped his egg himself, the \nmighty one of mysterious birth, who (himself) created his beauty." Such \nabstractions failed to satisfy the literal-minded Egyptian, who wanted \nto know how Ra did it. Priests responded with the same evasiveness that \nmodern priesthoods also exhibit: \n\nHis image is not spread out in books. . . . He is too mysterious that his \nglory should be revealed, too great that men should question concern- \ning him, too powerful that he should be known. One falleth down dead on \nthe spot for terror, if his mysterious, unknowable name is pronounced. \nNo god can address him by it, him with the spirit, whose name is hidden, \nfor that he is a mystery. 6 \n\nYet Ra was not only the Goddess\'s child; he may even have \nbeen a masculinized version of the Goddess herself. One of her ancient \nnames was Ra with a feminine ending -r: "Ra-t of the two lands, the \nlady of heaven, mistress of the gods . . . mistress of Heliopolis." Her full \nname was Rat-taiut, "Ra-t of the world." 7 Her city, translated into \nGreek as Heliopolis, was the Egyptian Anu, which the Bible calls On. \nThe Goddess really controlled Ra by means of his secret soul-name. \nEach day she laid on him an unbreakable spell, forcing him to grow old \nand senile as he limped on his cane toward his death at sunset. She \nforced him to stand still at the summit of heaven while she resurrected \nher son Horus from the dead, a feat on which the Jews modeled their \nmyth of Joshua\'s arrest of the sun at the battle of Jericho. 8 \n\nThe Jews enthusiastically adopted Ra and identified him with \nYahweh, especially in his Babylonian form as the sun god Shamash \n\n\n\n838 \n\n\n\n(Chemosh). Beth-Shemesh, House of the Sun, was a biblical version of Rabbatu \n\nthe sun god\'s shrine, corresponding to Egyptian per Ra. The God of Ragnarok \n\nMoses followed Ra\'s custom, demanding that his worshipper go bare- > ^ 1 ^ m \n\nfoot in his presence. "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place \nwhereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5). 9 Sometimes the \nJews called their sun god Elias, a corruption of the Greek Helios. \nElias was the "father" Jesus called upon from the cross (Matthew \n27:47-49). \n\n1.

Rabbinical writings admitted that during \nthis tribal period, the Four Matriarchs Rachel, Sarah, Rebecca, and \nLeah were more important than the Three Patriarchs Abraham, \nIsaac, and Jacob. 2 \n\n1.

Rawson, A.T., 99. \n\n\n\nRagnarok \n\nNorse doomsday, the end of the present universe. Heimdall would \nannounce the last battle of the gods by blowing the Last Trump on his \nhorn; there would follow the destruction of the earth, the disappear- \nance of the sun, the death of all gods, and the return of the world to its \noriginal state of chaos. \n\n\n\n839 \n\n\n\nRainbow \n\n\n\nUpanishads \n\nBuddhist scriptures \nrepresenting the final \nstage in Vedic thought, \ndealing with the \nphilosophy known as \nVedanta. The Katha \nUpanishad discusses \ntransmigration of \nsouls, the nature of \neternal life, the \ndoctrine of maya, and \nan account of a visit \nto Yama, Lord of the \nDead. \n\n\n\nRainbow \n\nMyths often associate the rainbow with the dream-time or Golden \nAge when earth and heaven were in easy communication with one \nanother. Deities, spirits, and mortals might pass back and forth on the \nrainbow bridge, which was also the axis mundi, or ladder of heaven, or \nnecklace of the Great Mother who ruled the Golden Age. The Pot of \nGold at the rainbow\'s end was another form of the Celts\' Holy Grail, a \nwomb symbol related to the pots where Mother Moon (Mana) kept \nthe souls of the dead in her western paradise. 1 \n\nThe rainbow\'s seven colors represented the seven celestial spheres \nand the rainbow-hued veils of Maya, the Goddess working behind \nthe veils to manifest the material world in its many-colored complexity. \nHer priestesses wore the colors of the veils, which appeared in \nEgyptian mythology as the seven stoles of Isis, and in the Bible as the \nseven veils of Salome. 2 \n\nThe rainbow veils of the Goddess Ishtar were sometimes gar- \nments, sometimes jewels. The rainbow was called her necklace, of \nwhich she made the bridge to heaven for the souls of her chosen ones. \nHer rainbow necklace had selective power. If the Goddess willed, \nneither man nor god could cross it. On one occasion she placed her \nrainbow to block the Heavenly Father from receiving the food laid on \nearth\'s altars, to punish him after he sent the Flood to destroy her \nearthly children. 3 Biblical writers re-interpreted this Babylonian myth \nto omit the Goddess and make the rainbow represent God\'s promise to \nNoah not to do it again. \n\nThe rainbow\'s selectivity is a common motif. The glowing bridge \nwas a broad way for the chosen, a razor-edge for the wicked. The \nKatha Upanishad said the rainbow bridge to heaven is as difficult to \ntraverse as the edge of a razor. 4 The Persians said the same of their \nKinvad or Cinvat rainbow bridge: "For the just it is nine lance-lengths \nwide, for the ungodly it is as narrow as the edge of a razor. The \nCinvat bridge is at the \'Center\' ... the bridge connects earth and \nheaven at the \'Center.\'" 5 Christian tradition spoke of the same \nselective bridge of heaven: "Narrow is the way . . . and few there be that \nfind it" (Matthew 7:14). \n\nThe Japanese said the rainbow is "the road of the gods and the \nbridge between sky and earth." As in India and Mesopotamia, its \nseven colors were associated with the seven heavens. "The throne of \nthe Supreme Being is surrounded by a rainbow, and the same \nsymbolism persists into the Christian art of the Renaissance." The sex of \nthe Supreme Being was changed by patriarchal theology, but the \nsymbol still suggests the archaic Maya-Shakti enveloped in her rainbow \nveils. "Shamanic drums are decorated with drawings of the rainbow \n\nrepresented as a bridge to the sky In the Turkic language the word \n\nfor rainbow means bridge." 6 \n\nNorthern pagans also said the Goddess\'s rainbow necklace and the \n\n\n\n840 \n\n\n\nrainbow Bridge of Heaven were one and the same. 7 Freya\'s magic \nnecklace Brisingamen was the same as the rainbow bridge called Bifrost \nor Bilrost, the "trembling way," also known as Asbru, "bridge of the \ngods." 8 During the Christian era, this rainbow bridge became one of \nthe features of Fairyland. Heathen legend said as doomsday ap- \nproached, the bridge would be broken down so there was no more \ncommunication between earth and heaven. In effect this meant \nmortals would no longer go to heaven, neither in the shamanic trance \nnor in the spirit after death. \n\nGreeks personified the rainbow as the Goddess Iris, usually called \nHera\'s messenger, one more instance of the Great Goddess\'s associa- \ntion with the garment of many colors, Maya\'s or Isis\'s veils. As the \n"bridge," Iris carried Mother Hera\'s messages to earth as the rain- \nbow-hued peacock carried the messages of Mother Juno. Iris also bound \nthe Nemean Lion with her colorful girdle and carried it to the sacred \ncave in the Nemean mountains. \n\n1. Davidson, 34. 2. Angus, 251. 3. Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 434. 4.

The ram was often selected for the dubious \nhonor of sacrifice, being identified with the god who immolated \nhimself to himself for the sake of humanity. \n\nSolar gods were linked with the heavenly ram Aries, who began \nthe sacred year, dead and reborn as the new Aeon. Egyptians called \nhim Amen-Ra, "the Ram, the virile male, the holy phallus, which \nstirreth up the passions of love, the Ram of rams." \' \n\nThe Ram Caught in a Thicket was a sexual metaphor and a \ncommon religious icon in Abraham\'s legendary home, Ur of the \nChaldees. The same Ram Caught in a Thicket appeared in the Bible as \na surrogate victim to replace Isaac, whose father Abraham was about \nto sacrifice him on the altar at Yahweh\'s command (Genesis 22:13). \nThe story marked a transition from ancient customs of human \nsacrifice to the classical rule of animal sacrifice, as shown also in the \nsubstitution of the ram of the Golden Fleece for the king\'s son in a \nBoeotian sacrifice to Zeus. 2 An older Midrashic version of the Abra- \nham-Isaac story said Abraham\'s hand was not stayed, the ram did not \nappear. Isaac was slaughtered, buried, and rose again on the third day. 3 \n\nRams were sacred in Israel as consorts of Rachel, the Holy Ewe, \nwhom the biblical narrative later married to Jacob, A reincarnated \nIsaac. Jews sacrificed the paschal lamb each year as a firstborn son of the \nram god who was identified with Yahweh. At one time the biblical \nGod wore ram\'s horns, later assigned instead to the devil. Joshua\'s \n\n\n\n841 \n\n\n\nRama priests used ram\'s horns to make victory magic (Joshua 6:4), showing \n\nRape that they were led by the divine ram in battle. \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 2, 64. 2.

One gets the impression that the Greeks \nthought women always had to be forced into sexual relationships, even \nwith gods. But the word translated "rape" usually meant seduction. \nTeiresias, who lived as both a man and a woman, announced his \ndiscovery that a woman\'s pleasure in sex was nine times that of a \nman. 1 \n\nTrue rape was not common in the ancient world. Like the males \nof all other mammalian species, the ancients believed sexual activity \nshould be initiated by the female. The modern conventional description \nof a rapist as an "animal" is a slur on the animal kingdom; animals do \nnot rape. Only man forces sexual attentions on an unwilling female. \n\nThe Bible tells of a Levite who gave up his concubine-wife to a \nmob to be gang-raped to death in order to save himself from \nmolestation, and then cut her to pieces. "All who saw it said, There was \nno such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel \ncame up out of the land of Egypt unto this day" (Judges 19:30). A war \nwas fought over the incident, showing that it was highly unusual. \n\nA change in the attitude toward rape was one of the contrasts \nbetween the ancient world and the medieval one in western Europe. \nThe Romans and Saxons punished rapists by death. Normans cut off a \nrapist\'s testicles and gouged his eyes out. 2 The gypsies\' Oriental \nheritage demanded the death penalty for a rapist. 3 Hindu law said a \nrapist must be killed, even if his victim was of the lowest caste, an \nUntouchable; and his soul should "never be pardoned. " 4 The Byzan- \ntine Code decreed that rapists must die and their property must be \ngiven to the victim, even if she was no better than a slave woman. 5 \n\nChristian laws changed the picture. Serfs\' wives, sisters, or daugh- \nters were always sexually available to their overlords under the new \n\n\n\n842 \n\n\n\nime. 6 Peasant brides were raped by the baron before being turned Rape \n\ner to their bridegrooms probably to be raped again. The Church \nmade it illegal for any wife to refuse sexual intercourse unless it was a ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nholy day when marital sex was prohibited. Therefore, marital rape \nwas encouraged. \n\nVictorian England almost achieved one of patriarchy\'s most \nsought-after goals: total male control of female sexuality. Until 1884 a \nwife could be jailed for trying to deny her husband his "conjugal rights." \nShe was as much a sexual slave as any inmate of an eastern harem. 7 \nForced to consent to frequent rape by husbands who neither knew nor \ncared about women\'s sexual enjoyment, 19th-century wives became \npredictably indifferent to the delights of the marriage bed, in such \nnumbers that medical authorities described women as "largely devoid \nof sexual pleasure." It was said in a standard marriage manual used for \ndecades, and translated into 1 2 languages: "Wives seldom seek the \ncloser embraces of their husbands. They are generally indifferent; often \nabsolutely averse. . . . God has made the passivity of the wife the \nprotection of her husband and a source of manifold blessing to their \nchildren." Having thanked God for a world of unaroused women, the \nauthor went on: "There can be little doubt that much marital indiffer- \nence upon the part of wives is due to chronic constipation, which is so \nprevalent among women. " 8 The implied assumption would be that \nGod foresightedly afflicted women with chronic constipation in \naddition to the other curses on Eve. \n\nSocieties retaining the idea of Goddess-worship seldom demon- \nstrate marital or extramarital rape; female sexuality is nearly always \nfully developed. Sadistic, violent sexual fantasies do not appear in the \nimagery of India. 9 The matriarchal Semai held it illegal for a man \neven to try to talk to a woman into sexual relations if she said no in the \nbeginning. 10 Anti-rape rules inspired warmer relationships, as G.B. \nShaw said: "The desire to give inspires no affection unless there is also \nthe power to withhold." n \n\nThe laws of Shaw\'s culture, however, were designed to deprive \nwomen of the power to withhold. Before 1653, any Englishman \ncould kidnap and rape a child heiress, after which the law viewed him as \nher legal husband. He was rewarded for rape with the acquisition of \nthe victim\'s property. In 1653 the law was changed not to help the \nvictim, but to cut the government in on the loot. A man could be \nimprisoned for raping a young girl for her money, but half the victim\'s \nestate was taken by the government. 12 \n\nVictorians never held men legally responsible for debauching \nadolescent girls, since the legal "age of consent" for females was \ntwelve. A child under the age of eight was not allowed to give evidence \nagainst a man who violated her, on the ground that she was too \nyoung to understand the legal oath. 13 Yet in the 16th century, authori- \nties set the "age of consent" at six years. 14 Raping children was a \ncommon enough pastime of Victorian men, who maintained that sexual \n\n\n\n843 \n\n\n\nRape intercourse with a virgin child was a sure cure for syphilis. As late as \n\nthe 1930s, the madam of a West End whorehouse advertised, "In my j \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ mB house you can gloat over the cries of the girls with the certainty that \nno one will hear them besides yourself." 1S \n\nVictorian pornography reflects an obsessive fascination for vio- \nlence and rape, often describing sexual partners as "adversaries," \nthough they were certainly not evenly matched. One male writer \nfantasized a female experience of defloration by a rapist who "quickly \nburied his tremendous instrument too far within me to leave me any \nchance of escape. He now paid no kind of attention to my sufferings, \nbut followed up his movements with fury, until the tender texture \naltogether gave way to his fierce tearing and rending, and one \nmerciless, violent thrust broke in and carried all before him, and sent it \nimbrued, reeking with blood of my virginity, up to its utmost length \nin my body. The piercing shriek I gave proclaimed that I felt it up to the \nvery quick; in short, his victory was complete." The same male writer \nmused complacently: "How magical is the influence of our sex over the \nfeelings of the softer one." 16 \n\nThe magic was not apparent to a modern rape victim who, \nnevertheless, displayed an almost catatonic acceptance of the victim\'s \nrole, in effect giving her attackers the right to abuse her: \n\nThey were just taking advantage of me because I was alone and available. \nThat\'s just the way men relate to women. If they \'re alone and available, \nwell, use them. Audit\'s nothing perverted. It\'s just their normal way of \nrelating to a woman. . . . \n\nAfter it was over, I was aware of pain and dirtiness in my body, and I \nwas hurt in my pride and confused about why they had raped me and \nwhy they were laughing at me and making fun of my body and taunting \nme. And I was also very sure that God was watching the whole thing \nand shaking his head and saying what a horrible person I was for allowing \nmyself to get raped. \' 7 \n\nStudies have shown that raped women often were reluctant to \nhurt their assailants, e.g. by gouging eyes or twisting testicles, even when \nthey had a chance. "Women often take the responsibility when men \ntreat them as prey. This isn\'t just an odd female quirk. The attitude is \ndeeply entrenched Women are taught to make themselves at- \ntractive to men. Those who don\'t are ignored by men or incur their \ndispleasure. But if they become victims of sexual assault, they are \nimmediately suspected of collusion. No man is ever guilty." 18 \n\nIn San Francisco in 1971, a gunpoint rapist was acquitted because \nhis unmarried victim admitted having a lover. Women picketers \nprotested the decision in vain, handing out leaflets which said: \n\nWhen a person is robbed, the robber is put on trial. When someone is \nmurdered, the murderer is tried. But when a woman is raped, it is the \nwoman and not the rapist who is put on trial. . . . If she can be shown to \nhave any sexual history, the rapist must be acquitted, for by their \ndefinition it is then no rape at all. For a woman to allow herself to be a sex- \\ \n\n\n\n844 \n\n\n\nual person, to enjoy her sexuality in her own way in her own time, is for Rape \n\nher to lose all protection from being forced to commit sexual acts with any \n\nman at any time. \' 9 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSometimes the culture forces on men a pseudo-rapist stance vis- \na-vis women, where men in groups gang up on a woman verbally or \nsymbolically, to injure her sense of self. One young woman wrote: \n"When I first started to live in the city, I would walk by the construction \nworkers having lunch and hear all those horrible comments. I didn\'t \nquite know how to deal with it. I was embarrassed because I had breasts. \nI felt it was my fault for having them, and that of course I deserved to \nbe commented upon. Now I know that\'s not true. It\'s they who have to \nchange, not me." 20 A recent investigator wrote: \n\nThe virility mystique . . . predisposes men to rape. If women were physi- \ncally stronger than men, I do not believe there would be any instances \nof female raping male, because female sexual socialization encourages a \nwoman to integrate sex, affection, and love, and to be sensitive to what \nher partner wants. Of course, there are many women who deviate from \nthis pattern, just as there are men who have managed to reject their \nsocialization for virility. But cultural trends make these cases exceptional. \nIf our culture considered it masculine to be gentle and sensitive, to be \nresponsive to the needs of others, to abhor violence, domination, and \nexploitation, to want sex only within a meaningful relationship, to be \nattracted by personality and character rather than by physical appearance, \nto value lasting rather than casual relationships, then rape would indeed \nbe a deviant act. . . . \n\nIf lynching is the ultimate racist act, rape is the ultimate sexist act. It \nis an act of physical and psychic oppression. . . . [L] ike lynching, it is \ncowardly, and like lynching, it is used to keep individual women, as well as \nwomen as a caste, in their place. And finally, as with lynching, the rape \nvictim is blamed for provocation. \n\nRape is an abuse of power, and the increase in rape shows that men \nare increasingly unable to handle their excessive power over women. . . . \nEradicating rape requires getting rid of the power discrepancy between \nmen and women. 2 \' \n\nFrom the Inquisition\'s torturers, who usually raped their victims \nfirst, to Victorian doctors who attacked female genitals with leeches, \nmany kinds of rape could be traced to what has been called "the \nvirulent woman-hatred in fundamentalist Christianity." 22 Recent stud- \nies show that most rapists were professed members of a religious sect \nand learned to regard sex as evil, in the traditional Christian manner. 23 \nOne rapist said, "I\'ve always been brought up that sex was dirty, sex \nwas not to be practiced." Another said he was "confused about just what \nthe sex act was and how they went about it." Another was so naive he \ndidn\'t know where babies came from, and another was ignorant of the \nword "vagina," calling it \'Virginia" instead. 24 "Sex offenders as a \ngroup were extremely naive about sexual matters, felt inferior, had \nsuffered in childhood from anxiety and fears about sex . . . and had \nlacked accurate sex instruction." 25 \n\n\n\n845 \n\n\n\nRati \n\n\n\nIn some areas, the laws of both church and state actually encour- \naged rape until very recently. Up to 1978 in Italy, a rapist could go \nunpunished if his victim agreed to marry him. By a combination of \nviolation and coercion, it was quite possible for a man to force \nmarriage on a woman who had every reason to fear and hate him.

J There may have been a connection with the \nGreeks\' Erato, "Passionate One," the Muse of erotic poetry. 2 Images of \nRati displayed the overflowing sexuality and fertility admired in \nancient matriarchies: huge breasts, a pregnant belly, a mouth twisted to \none side and shaped like a vulva. Zimmer\'s description shows the \ntypical uneasiness of the western male in the presence of such exagger- \nated symbols of the Eternal Feminine: \n\nThe goddess of maternity and fertility . . . is indicating, with a traditional \ntwofold symbolic gesture, the two main functions of the female \nprinciple. One forearm lifts the breasts that nourish the creatures she \nbrings forth, while the other hand, placed at the lower abdomen, \nimmediately above the organ of generation, presses the ever-pregnant \nwomb. The sensual mouth, with its half-open lips and broadening gap \nat the left corner, has a voluptuous, dolorous trait, suggesting simulta- \nneously the delights of love and conception and the pangs and throes of \nbirth. The figure exhibits, frankly, all the innocent shamelessness of \narchaic mother figures, but in addition or so it seems the challeng- \ning, calm, watchful, and consciously exhibitionistic attitude of a curiously \ndemonic, suprahuman harlot. The hideous and grotesque features are \nsuffused with a sinister, devilish allure of sex. . . . \n\nThe image, though by no means isolated in the art of Bali, is one of \nits most challenging and meaningful specimens . . . rawly protesting, as \nit were, against the lofty doctrines of release and transcendent redeeming \nwisdom, which, in the forms of Buddhist and yogic asceticism, were the \nmost conspicuous and forceful products, in that period, of the masculine \nspirit. After milleniums of the struggle of the gurus to disengage man \nfrom the brutish thrall of the demonic powers of sheer nature, these \nunabated, unconquered, and unreconciled still were there. And they \nare both shocking and attractive. * \n1. Budge, G.E. 1, 328. 2. Graves, G.M. 2, 390. 3.

Many forms of the Lord of Death were incarnate in a raven. \nChukchi shamans called their ancestral wizard-king Big Raven, he \nwho was ceremonially castrated and killed. 1 Danes spoke of a Valraven \nwho was Hel\'s king in the underworld. As a son and mate of the \nnether Goddess, he was sometimes personified as King Morvran, "Sea- \nRaven." 2 \n\nValkyries could take the form of ravens to drink the blood of slain \nwarriors, which is why Norse skalds called blood "the raven\'s drink." 3 \nLike a Valkyrie-psychopomp, a raven was supposed to perch on the \nshoulder of the Orphic initiate as he entered the temple for the \nceremony of mock death and rebirth. 4 According to the Mithraic \nMysteries, the initiate received the title of Raven when he attained \nthe first degree of enlightenment, which corresponded to ascent to \nheaven\'s lunar sphere, the domain of the Moon-goddess who re- \nceived and cared for the dead. 5 \n\nSo constant was the death-and-resurrection symbolism of the raven \nin Germanic tradition that the new Germanic hero of the Second \nComing, Emperor Frederick, was said to be guarded by ravens as he \nwaited, sleeping, in his underground sanctuary for the day of his \nreturn to earth. According to the Armenian version, the emperor still \nsleeps under a magic hill called Rock of the Raven. 6 In fairy tales, a \nraven is often the soul-bird who conducts the hero into mysterious \nunderground places and out again, or gives information concerning \nthe after-world. \n\n1.

Borchardt, 152. \n\n\n\nReincarnation \n\nLiterally, "re-fleshing," the basic Oriental view of cyclic rebirth after \neach death; the original meaning of being born again. In the role of \nFate-goddess, the Great Mother governed the Wheel of Becoming \n(Greek, kyklos geneseon) which meant the cycles of successive lives, \nlike the wheel of karma governed by Kali. 1 \n\nPatriarchal thinkers tended to deny the doctrine of reincarnation in \n\n\n\n847 \n\n\n\nReincarnation \n\n\n\nFirst Book of \n\nAdam and Eve One of \n\nthe legendary \napocrypha (works \nwritten in Greek \nfrom Jewish sources) \ngiving additional \ndetails or alternative \nversions of the \nGenesis myths. \n\n\n\nfavor of the one-way trip to heaven or hell after only one life on \nearth. They sought eternal stasis rather than cycles. Yet reincarnation \nwas the standard belief of all the ancient nations, with the patriarchal \nprinciple of eternal stasis appearing only as a late development. \n\nPythagoras believed in transmigration of souls from one body to \nanother: "The spirit wanders, comes now here, now there, and \noccupies whatever frame it pleases. From beasts it passes into human \nbodies, and from our bodies into beasts, but never perishes." 2 Plato \nhad the same idea. His Republic depicted Greek heroes in the under- \nworld choosing bodies for their next incarnation on earth. The rebirth \ndoctrine prevailed among cultured Greeks who had been initiated into \nthe Mysteries. Their idea was the same as the Tantric idea, which \npromised free choice of subsequent bodies to the Enlightened Ones in \nthe Intermediate State between death and the next life. 3 \n\nEven Jewish tradition retained traces of the reincarnation doctrine. \nIn the First Book of Adam and Eve, Adam offered God a sacrifice of \nhis own blood, saying, "Be favorable to me every time I die, and bring \nme to life." 4 Orthodox Jews made it a rule not to name a newborn \nchild after a living person, lest untimely transmission of the name-soul \nshould bring death to the elder. The rule stemmed from the ancient \nbelief that every infant possessed the soul of an ancestor in a new body. 5 \nThe Jewish belief that a woman could conceive by bathing in water \nused to wash a corpse clearly points to a belief in reincarnation. 6 Indeed, \nthe Talmud says Adam was reincarnated in the person of David, and \nthen again in the Messiah. 7 \n\nReincarnation was the general belief not only in the Orient but \nthroughout pagan Europe. Caesar said the druids taught this doctrine \nof cyclic rebirths. 8 It is still the prevailing opinion among "primitive" \npeoples who imagine their own souls to be temporary bits of the \nWorld Soul that animates all living things. The Poetic Edda demon- \nstrates a belief in the karmic wheel of reincarnations, from which one \nmay be released only by self-destruction. Brynhild\'s suicide insured that \n"born again she may never be." 9 Among the Eskimos as among \nancient Greeks and Hindus, cycles of reincarnation include all forms of \nlife. They say the Goddess of Animals looks after all creatures and \ndoesn\'t like to see too many of them killed, since they are of the same \nspiritual substance as human beings. "Life is endless," the shamans \nsay, "only we do not know in what form we shall reappear after \ndeath." 10 \n\nReincarnation was necessarily bound up with motherhood in all \nsocieties, since mothers were its agents and carriers. It was the mother \nof Lemminkainen, hero of the Kalevala, who gave him another life after \nhe was killed. 11 In northern India, dead infants were buried under the \nthreshold of the house, so their spirits might enter the bodies of mothers \nwho passed in and out and so be born again. 12 \n\nReincarnation seems to have been a secret tenet of some of the \nearly Christian churches, not explained to ordinary congregations but \n\n\n\n848 \n\n\n\nivealed in secret after the preliminary stages of initiation into an inner \n;roup of "elect" or "perfected" mystics. Later, the exoteric church \nrepudiated the doctrine of karmic rebirth. In 553 a.d. the Second \nCouncil of Constantinople laid down a decree: "Whosoever shall \nsupport the mythical doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul and the \nconsequent wonderful opinion of its return, let him be anathema." \nOrigen, once accounted a saint and a father of the church, taught the \ndoctrine of reincarnation; but three centuries after his death he was \nofficially excommunicated "on account of his beliefs." 13 \n\nThe concept of reincarnation made nonsense of the Christian \ndoctrine of reward and punishment after death. If all souls returned to \nthe same Cauldron of Regeneration, including animal souls mingling \nwith human ones, logically they were not differentiated for eternity \ninto "evil" and "good" souls. The West\'s traditional denial of soul-stuff \nto animals, and its insistence that man alone was immortal and stood \nat the pinnacle of all creation, led to abuses contributing to the present- \nday ecological crisis. At a symposium of theologians in California, \n1970, "virtually all the scholars agreed that the traditional Christian \nattitude toward nature has given sanction to exploitation of the \nenvironment by science and technology and thus contributed to air and \nwater pollution, overpopulation and other ecological threats." Lynn \nWhite wrote, "One of the causes of our present crisis is to be found in \nthe Judeo-Christian traditions . . . which speak of man\'s dominance \nover nature. ... By destroying pagan animism, Christianity made it \npossible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of \nnatural objects." M It is odd that even here, those living things with \nfeelings are called "objects." \n\nEastern opinions on reincarnation mitigated man\'s cruelty to his \nfellow creatures, at the price of attributing to them a psychic content \nindistinguishable from that of human beings. It is no great moral victory \nto refrain from killing a spider if one sincerely believes the spider \ncould contain the soul of one\'s grandmother. It might be more moral to \nrefrain from killing a spider simply because it is alive, and wishes to \nremain so; and all will to live deserves respect. \n\nPerhaps the best one could say for reincarnation was that it was not \nwasteful. Its soul-stuff was preserved and recycled. The Christian \ntheory was less tidy, with constant new creation of supposedly "immor- \ntal" souls, since the world began: a vast accumulation, still increasing \ndaily. In practice, however, many Christians secretly believed in some \nform of the forbidden reincarnation. Like Orphics, some even \nclaimed they could remember their former lives. The conspicuous \nabsence of proof for such claims only seems to strengthen the faith of \nthose who wish to believe. \n\nI. Bardo Thodol, lxvii. 2. Campbell, P.M., 293-94. 3.

At first \nhe was accounted a \nsaint, but three \ncenturies after his \ndeath he was declared \na heretic because of \nGnostic elements \nfound in his writings. \n\n\n\n849 \n\n\n\nReligion \n\n\n\nSir Richard Francis \n\nBurton (1821-1890) \nBritish traveler, \nconsul, orientalist, \ntranslator of The \nArabian Nights, author \nof more than 50 \nbooks on Indian, \nArabian, South \nAmerican and African \ncultures including \na book on the Mormons \nof Salt Lake City. \nBurton was one of the \nfirst Europeans to \nmake the pilgrimage to \nMecca and Medina; \nand with J.H. Speke, \none of the first to \ndiscover Lake \nTanganyika and the \nsources of the Nile. \n\n\n\nReligion \n\nLatin rehgio meant re-linking or reunion, a restoration of the umbili- \ncal bond between nature and man, or between the Mother Goddess and \nher son-consort, typified by human sexual union. The Sanskrit \nequivalent was yoga, which also meant linking or joining, root of the \nEnglish "yoke." 1 \n\nA need to re-establish the mother-child bond in symbol may have \nbeen the source of all religion, which Schleiermacher defined as an \ninfantile "feeling of absolute dependence." 2 Gaylin says "the helpless- \nness of infancy" is transmuted in religious imagery to "a plea for a \nsolution to the problem of survival." 3 Significantly, the mature, caretak- \ning figure even in patriarchal religious imagery was the female, not \nthe male. God nearly always had a baby stage, appearing in his Mother\'s \narms. But the Goddess, even in her virgin form, was full grown and \nmaternally capable. This curious fact may be based on the attitude of \nworshipper to deity as a child to parent, and the true biological parent \nrecognized by all mammals is the mother. Thus, even patriarchal \nreligions conceal the "strong unconscious trend towards mother- \nworship." 4 \n\nFreud defined religion as an attempt to control the mental world \n"by means of a world of wishes." Religious images are "fulfilments of \nthe oldest, strongest, most compelling wishes of mankind." 5 Apart from \nthe wish to control the Mother figure, and the wish not to die, the \ngods made in the image of men expressed a rather paltry, self-seeking \nseries of wishes obviously drawn from limited imagination. Santayana \nremarked, "It is pathetic to observe how lowly are the motives that \nreligion, even the highest, attributes to the deity, and from what a \nhard-pressed and bitter existence they have been drawn. To be given \nthe best morsel, to be remembered, to be praised, to be obeyed \nblindly and punctiliously these have been thought points of honor \nwith the gods." 6 Of course these were points of honor with men first. \nAs Sir Richard Francis Burton said, "The more I study religions, the \nmore I am convinced that man never worshipped anything but \nhimself." 7 \n\nBuddhist ascetics concurred, saying a man\'s self is "nearer to us \nthan anything else, indeed dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, \ndearer than all beside. Let a man worship the Self alone as dear, for if he \nworship the Self alone as dear, the object of his love will never \nperish." Children were of no interest to the male ascetics: "Realizing \nthe glory of the Self, the sages of old craved not sons nor daughters. \n\'What have we to do with sons and daughters,\' they asked, we who \nhave known the Self, we who have achieved the supreme goal of \nexistence?\' " 8 \n\nWith the advent of male gods, religions tended to become obses- \nsive about guilt and sin, worried about what the gods might punish as \nhubris, fearful of giving offense by a careless word or deed. In short, the \n\n\n\n850 \n\n\n\ngods behaved like not particularly loving fathers, or elder males Religion \n\nseeking to maintain ascendancy over younger ones. The Judeo-Chris- \n\ntian deity became one of the foremost examples of Oepidal hostility ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nin the world pantheon. He punished the whole human race for one sin \nof its remote ancestor, with a punishment so terrible that it would last \nforever in merciless agony. The fear of so irrational and vindictive a \ndeity drove a whole civilization into neurosis. Social evils that might \nhave been remedied were left unchecked, on the theory that all human \nbeings were sinful wretches who deserved to suffer especially wom- \nen, the primary sinners. Serfdom, slavery, legalized brutality, economic \noppression all were excused in the name of a vengeful God, whose \npriesthood insisted on his hostility toward humanity, to the point where \nunspeakable atrocities were committed to the greater glory of reli- \ngion. 9 Christian history shows that religion may follow a humane course \nin response to social trends; but it does not lead the way. \n\nWith its doctrine of inherited sin, for which no man could atone by \nhimself without the intercession of the Son whose death the Father \ncommanded, Christianity set out to formalize the hostile parent figure \nin its insistence that the only way to righteousness was to fear God. \nAccordingly, fathers of the church emphasized this point. Lactantius \nclaimed all religion depends on fear; Tertullian asked, "How are you \ngoing to love, unless you are afraid not to love?" ,0 The horror story of \nGod\'s hostility toward his wretched children was treated as a literal \nreality, not a psychological image. This "fiction of timeless truths has \ntaxed the ingenuity of even the ablest of rationalizers who seek by \nmeans of subtle taxonomic devices to fit embarrassing new discoveries \ninto the framework of the old beliefs." n As the old beliefs were \nproducts of primitive ignorance, their framework has had to be stretched \nto cover an immense body of fact that it was never meant to cover. \nThe fit is still poor: \n\nNo ethics and no religion can contain any wisdom that can transcend \nman \'s own knowledge about the immediate and future consequences \nof his own behavior. Every religion and every ethical system must \nrecognize that it might well be made obsolete by an extension of \nhuman knowledge in almost any area. . . . \n\nFar from any evidence of far-sighted and consistent leadership, the \nclergy has shown nothing other than all too human tendency to fill \ntheir sails with whatever winds of public opinion may blow, and always \nwith their vested interest firmly at the helm. \' 2 \n\nThe clergy\'s vested interest now dictates revision of traditional \nillusions to suit more modern thinking. Augstein says theologians now \nadmit that "Christianity has been on the wrong track for sixteen \nhundred years, ever since Constantine, that it has had a wrong concep- \ntion of God all that time and is only now in a position to disclose its \nsocial mores in short, that it must start all over again. But when \nreligion was powerful, it never wielded any positive influence on \n\n\n\n851 \n\n\n\nReligion \n\n\n\nRev. Kirsopp Lake \n\nBritish ecclesiastical \nhistorian, author of \nLandmarks in the \nHistory of Early \nChristianity, 1920. \n\n\n\nsocial mores; so why should it do so today, when it is a survival sinking \nout of sight?" " Churches have not shown any inclination to reform \nthemselves except when sales of their nonproduct decline to the danger \npoint, and few take much active interest in social issues. Farm worker \nRoberto Acuna spoke bitterly of his church\'s indifference: "I could tear \nthe churches apart. I never saw a priest out in the fields trying to help \n\npeople [I]t\'s always the church taking from the people." M \n\nJames Martineau, professor of moral philosophy at Manchester \nNew College, summed up the dilemma of conventional religion in \nThe Seat of Authority of Religion: \n\nChristianity . . . has been mainly evolved from that which is unhistorical \nand perishable in its sources; from what is unhistorical in its traditions, \nmythological in its preconceptions, and misapprehended in the oracles of \nits prophets. From the fable of Eden to the imagination of the last \ntrumpet, the whole story of the divine order of the world is dislocated and \ndeformed. . . . \n\nThe spreading alienation of the intellectual classes of European \nsociety from Christendom, and the detention of the rest in their \nspiritual culture at a level not much above that of the Salvation Army, are \nsocial phenomena which ought to bring home a very solemn appeal to \nthe consciences of ordinary churches. ,f \n\nSome scholars find it baffling that man seems unable to found \nan ethic or a philosophy on perceptions of reality, but instead must cling \nto crude myths even to the point of filling his own life and the lives \nof others with unnecessary horrors. 16 Among the worst of these is the \nreal violence with which man attacks the questioners or doubters of \nhis myths: as if to kill his own reasonable doubts before they rise up to \nthe surface of his mind and become fully conscious. \n\nTo purvey an unenlightened education, teaching myths as if they \nwere facts, is another abuse of cultural communication, inflicting on \nchildren a confusion between truth and fantasy that may haunt them all \ntheir lives and prevent them from developing clear thought on any \nsubject. It isn\'t always easy for a child to know where the real world \nstops and his own imagination begins. If adults can\'t help him draw \nthe line, because their own minds are muddled by an age-old ignorance, \nthe next generation will repeat the errors of centuries. \n\nReligions affect to purvey "higher Truth," but all too often their \ncapital-T Truth bears an uncanny resemblance to a capital-L Lie. One \ntheologian said the objective of religion is "to know the truth and to \nlive by it"; but the same theologian defined religion as "believing things \nthat do not seem to be so, and always it is believing what cannot be \nproved to be so." A less subtle seminarian once defined religion as "the \npower that enables us to believe what we know to be untrue." 17 No \nwonder the Rev. Kirsopp Lake lamented that a clergyman is "apt to \nhave a lower standard of intellectual honesty than would be tolerated \nin any other profession." A noted historian writes: "The churches have \nlong brought up the intellectual rear of our civilization, and . . . their \n\n\n\n852 \n\n\n\nI claims to spiritual leadership are still weakened by their engrained Religion \n\nI tendency to resist new knowledge and aspiration. Most are still \n\ndisposed to a dogmatic supernaturalism that saps the intellectual honesty ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nand courage essential for a responsible idealism." 18 \n\nIt is often taken for granted that religion helps to keep the ordinary \n\ncitizen honest, presumably through fear of divine punishment. This \n\nmay be a misapprehension: \n\nEvery survey ever undertaken of the composition of the criminal popula- \ntion reveals a percentage of the avowedly religious higher than a \nrandom sample of the population will show. . . . Little or no relationship \nwas found between the presence or absence, intensity, or kind of \nexpression of religious faith, and conduct or moral standard. Some of \nthose who were most skeptical, or who denied all need of faith or \nconcern with religious problems, were unimpeachable in behavior, kind \nand helpful to others, and of high integrity. . . . \n\nThe many attempts to find evidence that religion or its practice have \n[sic] desirable consequences in crime prevention have without excep- \ntion ended in failure . . . there seems to be no convincing evidence that \nconventional religion, of itself, has proved an effective antidote to \ncrime. \' 9 \n\nUnfortunately, in the western world religion has proved more \noften an instrument of oppression than a guide to more honest or more \ntolerant living. Churches generally supported the powerful at the \nexpense of the powerless. For example, the church helped even the \ncrudest monarchies in history by formulating and upholding the \ndoctrine of the divine right of kings. In the present century the world \nhas seen cardinals praying for the success of dictators. 20 \n\nThe common symbol of religious organization is "the shepherd \nand the herd he must tend . . . and at the bottom of it lies the childlike \nconcept that our elders run the world for our benefit." 21 Of course, the \nshepherd doesn\'t tend the herd for the benefit of the sheep. He tends \nthem for his own benefit. He makes his living from them. In some ways \nthe analogy is apt. Ecclesiastical "shepherds" in the past have resorted \nto every imaginable crime to increase their profits: land-grabbing, \nvandalism, false advertising, defamation of character, forgery, plagia- \nrism, even all-out war and murder, ever since Pope Leo the Great \nendorsed the death penalty for "erroneous beliefs." There is still a \ntendency among Christians to "assume that theirs is the only true \nreligion, and that their Christian duty is to convert the rest of the \nworld. The rest of the world, which happens to include the great \nmajority of mankind, still resents this assumption." 22 \n\nChristian elitism allowed theologians to "believe that they speak \nfor everyone when they lecture about things like guilt, love, sin, and \ngrace. This naivete allows them to make definitive statements about the \ntrue way in which all people should live and think about these \nmatters. Theologians are ignorant of what every anthropologist \nknows i.e, that the forms of our thought derive from the forms of \n\n\n\n853 \n\n\n\nRenenet our culture." It has been demonstrated often enough that women \n\nparticularly suffered from the suppression of their own natural reli- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ gious imagery in favor of an imposed masculine, alien, hierarchical \nsystem. "For women to become intellectually responsible and cre- \native members of society, they have to outgrow Oedipal dependence on \npaternal authority whether that authority is embodied in a paternalis- \ntic husband, or father, or God." Feminists have shown "how important \nthe demise of Yahweh and Christ is to the intellectual independence \nof Western women. Freud was certain that Judaism and Christianity \nstunted the intellectual maturity of men. It is probable, however, that \nthese religions are even more damaging to the intellectual growth of \nwomen." 23 \n\nOne might hope that, if women again become free to create their \nown religion as they were in the distant past, it would be a religion \nless sullied by the profit motive, the cruelty, hostility, and Oedipal \njealousy that disfigures the religious images of men. One might hope, \nalso, that it would remain open to correction by new scientific discover- \nies, as Christianity has never been. Thomas Aquinas warned long ago \nthat the faith would become a matter of ridicule "if any Catholic, not \ngifted with the necessary scientific learning, presents as dogma what \nscientific scrutiny shows to be false." 24 Later churchmen forgot this \nadvice. In consequence they can offer no reason other than the \nchurch\'s decree at present to endorse such impossibilities as a virgin \nbirth, transubstantiation, resurrection of the flesh, and all the biblical \nmiracles. At the same time they must deny the very same impossibilities \nclaimed by Christianity\'s historical rivals, on equally credible (or \nincredible) grounds. \n\nIt seems the religions of the western world have reached a period \nof crisis and must dissolve and re-form according to new principles, \nperhaps more realistic and humanistic ones. \n\n1.

Her title was \na traditional epithet of a harlot-priestess. See Grail, Holy. \n\nl.Guerber.L.M.A.,200. \n\n\n\nRestituta, Saint \n\n"Restored One, " a saint whose legend probably was based on a \nvandalized and half-burned statue of the Goddess found on the isle of \nIschia and replaced in her temple. According to the Christian myth, \nRestituta was a "virgin martyr" slain in Africa and consigned to a boat \nfilled with burning pitch. The boat drifted ashore on Ischia where her \nremains were taken up by Christians and "reverently cared for." \' The \nmore likely possibility was that the Ischians took up the damaged \nimage of their Goddess and restored her to her temple after an attack by \nfanatical iconoclasts. \n\n1. Brewster, 245. \n\n\n\nRevelation \n\nLatin revektio meant to draw back the veil (velum). 1 It was the \nGoddess\'s rainbow veil that concealed the future and the secrets of the \nspirit under the colors of earthly appearances. After death, men might \nsee her "face to face." A vision of the naked Goddess was vouchsafed to \nher sacred kings, who could draw back the veil of her temple, the \nhymen, pierce her virginity and die in their mating, to become gods. \nBut, as the Goddess said on her temple at Sais, "No mortal has yet \nbeen able to lift the veil which covers me." 2 Those who saw her \nunveiled were no longer mortal. \n\nIn time, the word revelation was applied to every religious vision \nor opinion. It even described the stereotyped pronouncements of \nfortune-tellers. \n\nThe Bible\'s Book of Revelation purports to be a doomsday-vision \nexperienced by St. John the Divine, but it is in fact a collection of \nimages and phrases from many sources. Literature of this kind was \n\n\n\n855 \n\n\n\nRhadamanthys plentiful in the first few centuries a.d., and it still occurred a thousand \n\nRhea years later in European pagan traditions, e.g. the very similar Voluspa \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ (Sybil\'s Vision) of the Scandinavian version of doomsday. \n\n1. Funk, 282. 2. Lurousse, 37. \n\n\n\nRhadamanthys \n\n"Diviner," one of three Cretan god-kings born of the Full-Moon \ngoddess Europa, fathered by Zeus. The other two were Sarpedon and \nMinos. \n\nRhadamanthys was said to have been so wise and just that in the \nunderworld he was made a judge of the dead, like the similar bull- \nking Yama in India. Some myths said when Rhadamanthys was installed \nin the paradise of the Elysian Fields he married Alcmene, "Moon- \npower," the virgin mother of Heracles. 1 Thus he was another form of \nthe Moon-bull king, like Zeus himself as consort of the Moon-cow \nEuropa a son identified with his divine father, like all other versions of \nthe Lord of Death. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,294. \n\n\n\nRhea \n\nCretan name of the Aegean Universal Mother or Great Goddess, \nwho had no consort and ruled supreme before the coming of patriarchal \nHellenic invaders. Rhea was the archetypal Triple Goddess, with \nseveral titles suggesting her separate functions: she was Britomartis the \nSweet Virgin, and Dictynna the Lawgiving Mother of Mount Dicte, \nand Aegea the foundress of Aegean civilizations. 1 Another of her names \nwas Coronis, both a carrion crow (death-goddess) and a virgin mother \n(life-goddess) of the great hero of healing, Asclepius, whose Titan cult \nthe Hellenic Zeus angrily destroyed. \n\nRhea was not restricted to the Aegean area. Among ancient tribes \nof southern Russia she was Rha, the Red One, another version of \nKali as Mother Time clothed in her garment of blood when she \ndevoured all the gods, her offspring. 2 The same Mother Time \nbecame the Celtic Goddess Rhiannon, who also devoured her own \nchildren one by one. 3 This image of the cannibal mother was typical \neverywhere of the Goddess as Time, who consumes what she brings \nforth; or as Earth, who does the same. When Rhea was given a \nconsort in Hellenic myth, he was called Kronus or Chronos, "Father \nTime," who devoured his own children, in imitation of Rhea\'s earlier \nactivity. He also castrated and killed his own father, the Heaven-god \nUranus; and he in turn was threatened by his own son, Zeus. 4 These \nmyths reflect the primitive succession of sacred kings castrated and killed \nby their supplanters. (See Kingship.) It was originally Rhea Kronia, \n\n\n\n856 \n\n\n\nMother Time, who wielded the castrating moon-sickle or scythe, a Rhinemaidens \n\nScythian weapon, the instrument with which the Heavenly Father \n\nvas "reaped." Rhea herself was the Grim Reaper. \n\nPre-Roman Latium knew her as Rhea Silvia, "Rhea of the \n\nWoodland," an early form of the Moon-goddess Diana, called the \n\nirst Vestal Virgin and the mother of Romulus and Remus. Under the \n\nrule of Rhea Silvia, the Vestal Virgins were neither celibate nuns, nor \n\nservants of the state, as they became in later ages. They were choosers \n\nand deposers of the early Latin kings, a college oimatronae who \n\nruled the rulers and took no husbands. Consequently all their children \n\nwere begotten by "gods," not by men, as were the children of Rhea \n\nSilvia herself. Once born, Rhea\'s children were cared for by Acca \nLarentia, a "holy harlot" or high priestess who also mothered all the \nancestral spirits (lares) of Rome. See Akka. \n\nHellenic myth assimilated Rhea as both mother and wife of the \nGreat God Zeus. Zeus "raped" his mother Rhea because she forbade \nhim to make a monogamous marriage (her own people had practiced \ngroup marriage). Then again, Zeus "raped" his sister-bride Hera, \nRhea\'s daughter, alter ego, and virgin phase, whose name was really the \nsame as Rhea\'s He Era, the Earth. 5 \n\nHaving forced Rhea-Hera to marry him, Zeus became a symbol of \nGreek wife-abuse. The Mother and Father of the Olympian gods \ndespised one another, constantly bickered and argued; mythographers \nalways carefully described Hera\'s hostile "jealousy" of Zeus\'s many \nimpregnations of mortal virgins to provide the earth with god-begotten \nheroes. To spite her twin-brother-son-husband, Rhea-Hera returned \nto her ancient birth-magic and parthenogenetically conceived and bore \nthe serpent god Python just as under the archaic title of Eurynome \nshe had created the world alone and given birth to the serpent god \nOphion. \n\nAnother name for Rhea was Pandora, "the All-giver," which \nHesiod converted into an Eve-like giver of disasters to mankind, \nthrough her excessive curiosity. 6 The myth had its origin in the idea that \nthe Goddess did indeed give all kinds of fate, death as well as birth, \nsuffering as well as joy, in her endless time-cycles. \n\nI, Lurousse, 85-86. 2.

Since the Nibelungs were "shades," or spirits of the dead, \nthe Ring symbolized the karmic wheel and the Rhinemaidens were \nkeepers of the dead who were consigned to water, like aquatic Valkyries. \nThey resembled eastern Vilas and Homeric Sirens; hearing their \nsweet songs could mean death to men. In antiquity, such songs were \n\n\n\n857 \n\n\n\nRobin \n\n\n\nsung by priestesses in connection with sending a corpse to the Water- \nmother by way of the funerary boat. \n\n\n\nRobin was Saracenic, \nfrom Rah-bin, "a seer," \ncognate with the \nSemitic rabba, "lord," \nreb or rabbi, a priest. \nRobin\'s cult penetrated \nnorthern Europe \nfrom roots in Moorish \nSpain. 7 The Iberian \npeninsula was not \nChristianized until \nthe overthrow of its \nArab governors in \nthe 11th century. Like \nScandinavia in the \nsame period, it was a \nfount of pagan ideas \nand practices. \n\n\n\nRobin \n\nGod of the Witches, with numerous variations: Robin Goodfellow, \nRobin son of Art, Robin the Bobbin, Robin Hood, or Robin Red- \nbreast the last apparently derived from memories of the Norman \nsacred king with blood-runes or gens-odd carved in the flesh of his \nbreast on his "red-letter day" (see Runes). As Lord of the Hunt and \na dying god he became the slain Cock Robin, whose executioner in the \nnursery rhyme did him in "with my wee bow and arrow" a Saxon \nversion of the Celtic Cu Chulainn who died at Mag Muirthemne \nbound to the sacred pillar and riddled with arrows. 1 \n\nThe red-breasted bird of spring was Cock Robin\'s soul; the red was \nhis blood, shed by a pagan sacrifice, though a pseudo-Christian \nlegend tried to explain it in a different way. A robin tried to pluck away \nthe thorns from Christ\'s crown, but only succeeded in tearing its own \nbreast, so all robins had red breasts thereafter. 2 This fable failed to \nremove the curse of Cock Robin in the opinion of Christian authori- \nties who knew quite well that he was a phallic god. \n\nIn Cornwall, Robin meant a cock in the other sense: a penis. His \nsurname Hood, or Hud, referred to the symbolic pine log, planted in \nMother Earth as a sacred pillar. A pamphlet of 1639 showed Robin as a \nhorned, hoofed, ithyphallic satyr, leading witches\' revels in the \ncompany of a black dog and an owl. 3 \n\nRobin Hood, Wizard of the Greenwood, was a real person or \npersons leading Sherwood Forest covens in the early 14th century, \nwith a wife or paramour taking the role of the Goddess Maerin, or \nMarian, or Mari-Anna, the Saxon wudu-maer, literally the Mary or \nthe Mother of the Grove. Great sacramental feasts in honor of Robin \nand his lady were remembered in popular rhymes nearly three \ncenturies later, when he was "Robin the Bobbin, the big-bellied Ben, \nwho ate more meat than fourscore men." 4 \n\nFamily names can be found dating back to the "greenwood \nmarriages" performed by heathen shamans, symbolized by the rene- \ngade Friar Tuck. Morrises and Morrisons descended from orgiastic \nMorris-dancers, also called Marian\'s morrice-men. 5 Like Robin (or \nRobinson), Morris dancers\' May Day rites came from Moorish Spain. \nThe original word was morisco, "Moorish." 6 \n\nThe common folk of England liked Robin, which is why they \ncalled him Goodfellow, or Puck, which descended from a word for \n"God." He was supposed to right the wrongs inflicted on the peasants \nby the church. He stole the treasures of the rich clergy and nobles \nand bestowed them on the poor. By force of arms he maintained a \nheathen preserve in the wildwood, a sanctuary for heretics and others \n\n\n\n858 \n\n\n\npersecuted by the church. Popular legend said Robin was born of a Roch, Saint \n\nvirgin impregnated by Oberon, King of the Fairies. He traveled to Romance \n\nfairyland, and was shown "many secrets which he never did open to the ^^m^mm^^^^m^ \nworld." 8 \n\nLike the Greeks\' Pan, Robin defended unspoiled land against the \nencroachment of towns. In country districts, each village set aside a \nplot of raw woodland, which was not to be disturbed, because it \nbelonged to The Goodfellow, or the Good Man. 9 Elders of the \nScottish church in 1 594 exerted their utmost influence to abolish this \nGoodfellow\'s Croft, which they called the devil\'s acre, claiming it \ngave "great offence." 10 \n\nMystery plays of the 1 6th century still continued to celebrate \nRobin, Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, Little John, and the other heathen \nheroes. A Churchwardens Account Book lists the prices of costumes for \nRobin and Marian as King and Queen of the May. The lady \nimpersonating Marian wore a crown, a purple coif, a blue surcoat, a \nyellow skirt, and red sleeves. 11 In such a way did the church ingest \npagan ceremonials by sponsorship, and eventually deprive them of \nserious meaning. \n\nI.

Male, 271. \n\n\n\nRomance \n\nPoets of the Middle Ages kept alive many druidic and other pre- \nChristian sacred tales, orally transmitted from generation to generation \nin the manner of the Vedas, under the guise of "romances." Earlier \nrhyme-makers were priests of the Goddess, who gave them the gift of \ninspiration from her magic cauldron, or Holy Grail. 1 A poet was like a \nseer or wizard, able to deal in "words of power," to create by the charms \nof speech, a blessing of the Muse. Medieval poets were worshippers \nof Art and Woman, founders of the cult of courtly love, singers of \nmansongr, the "woman-songs" beloved by the Goddess; and they \nwere mockers of the church. \n\nPoets seem to have regarded themselves as a dispossessed priest- \nhood of the Goddess Love (Minne), who inspired the church\'s \n\n\n\n859 \n\n\n\nRomance \n\n\n\nFrithiof s saga \n\nSwedish national poem \ncomposed by Esias \nTegner (1782-1846), \nbased on an Old \nIcelandic saga. \n\n\n\nChansons de gestes \n\nOld French epic \npoetry of the 11th to \n13th centuries. \n\n\n\nhostility. Before the 13th century, poets were denied Christian commu- \nnion, and denounced by churchmen as "ministers of Satan." Later, \nthey won acceptance by using biblical and theological motifs in their \nsongs, but romantic poetry remained suspiciously heretical. 2 \n\nOld romances depicted the clergy as rude, brutish fellows who \nmistreated delicate ladies, and even displayed sadistic behavior toward \ntheir own brethren. 3 The pagan gods were credited with warmer \npersonalities. Frithiof \'s saga suggested that, though Christ despised \nlovers, the god Balder did not. Lovers could meet in the temples of \nBalder, "the pious god," because "Is not his love for Nanna part of \nhis own nature, pure and warm? " Romantic heroes generally avoided \nthe Christian paradise and went to the earthly one, governed by the \nGoddess Morgan, or the Fairy Queen. 4 \n\nAccording to the Lay of Gudrun, the poet had more magic power \nthan any priest. Like the poet-savior Orpheus, he could charm birds \nand beasts with his music, and even raise the dead. His songs were \nbetter liked than clerical sermons: \n\nWhate\'er he might be singing, to no one seemed it long; \nForgotten in the minster were priest and choral song, \nChurch bells no longer sounded so sweetly as before, \nAnd every one who heard him longed for the minstrel sore. s \n\nMinstrels\' ballads have been praised as works that seem "to have \nlooked deepest into the human heart," excluding their occasional \nChristian moralizing which is always "manifestly a later addition." \nSteenstrup calls attention "to what small degree the ecclesiastical, or the \nstrictly Catholic, element . . . gets leave to appear. . . . [T]he religious, \nthe ecclesiastical, the Catholic element has been clapped on later, and \n... it is a disturbing and jarring force." 6 The bards invoked not God but \nErda Mother Earth and the Goddess Minne, whose name was a \nsynonym for Love. 7 \n\nTo churchmen, love was "nothing." To play at a game of chance \n"for love" was to play for nothing. 8 The expression "for love or \nmoney" began with this distinction between pagan and Christian \nmotivations. The troubadours and minnesingers acted for Minne- \ndienst, the "service of love." 9 Of course, donations were always \nacceptable. \n\nThe cult of Love rarely included marriage, which was usually \narranged by the couple\'s elders, for economic reasons. Ladies of the \nCourts of Love in southern France said true love couldn\'t exist between \nmarried people. True love could exist only between a lady and her \nchosen knight, who was expected to prove "gallantry" in combat before \nhe could be a "gallant," or lover. Ladies told their suitors, "It is \n\nnecessary that for love of me you should do deeds of chivalry I will \n\ngive you all my love as soon as I have seen you fight your first joust." \nChansons de gestes advised warriors to strike their enemies squarely in \\ \nthe bowels, so as to win the love of "the most beautiful ladies of the \ncourt." 10 \n\n\n\nS60 \n\n\n\nThis was a curiously mammalian-biological system, in which \nwomen watched men in combat and rewarded the winners with \nsexual favors. Bishop Jacques of Vitry complained that knights fought in \ntournaments only to gain "the favors of the shameless women whose \ntokens they wear." The monk Gildas described the barbarian aristocracy \nas "addicted to vice, adulterous, and enemies of God." u \n\nOld ballads and romances depict a society in which men constantly \nshowed off to excite women\'s admiration, almost like male birds and \nbeasts displaying themselves to females. Norse skalds said everything \nmen did was to impress the ladies. When women were watching, \nthey spurred their horses to go faster, so "readily will look the ladies and \nlasses, as we are passing." 12 Geoffrey of Monmouth said the noble \nwomen were celebrated for their wit, and "esteemed none worthy of \ntheir love, but such as had given proof of their valor in three several \nbattles." 13 \n\nThere arose a corollary belief that no man could fight well unless \ninspired by the promise of his lady-love. Tristan said a man couldn\'t \nbe a warrior unless he was a lover. Lancelot became invincible only \nbecause Elaine gave him her sexual-symbolic love-token, a red silk \nsleeve as "sheath" for his "sword." Minnesinger Wolfram von Eschen- \nbach wrote of the love-trance that made a knight invincible, like a \nberserker. Wolfram\'s Parsifal asserted that for every kind of spiritual aid, \nincluding courage in battle, "it is better to trust a woman than \nGod." 14 \n\nThis Germanic Parsifal incorporated no Christian ceremony but \nwas written as if the church didn\'t exist. Parsifal\'s prayers were \naddressed to his lady, who magically protected him in battle and gave \nhim success as if she were a sacred agent of the ancient Lady of \nVictory. He fought in a love-trance of communion with her spirit, \nwhich made him virtually superhuman. 15 \n\nThis pagan knight fought his own alter ego, a Christian knight who \nfell back before the onslaught of the "heathen man" made invincible \nby his lady\'s love. "The heathen never wearied of love; his heart, \ntherefore, was great in combat." When he cried the name of his \nqueen\'s dwelling place, "his battle strength increased." 16 \n\nFor a while, certain sects of warriors undertook to defend the \nbeleaguered rights of women, in the name of the Goddess. From this \nperiod dated romantic stories of knights who rescued "castles of \nwomen" from robber barons who had seized their property. About the \n12th century, when the church began to arm its laws with the teeth of \nthe Inquisition, emphasis shifted from defense of women to defense of \nthe church. Sir Parsifal, or Perceval, presented a typical example of \nthe pagan hero who finally turned Christian and renounced women. \n\nAt first he was a champion of Love; but later he was "purified," \nand described by an ecclesiastical writer as "one of the men of the \nworld at that time which most believed in our Lord Jesus Christ, for in \nthose days there were but few folks who believed in God perfectly." \nPerceval set out to rescue "a gentlewoman which is disherited," but \n\n\n\nRomance \n\n\n\nWolfram von \nEschenbach Highly \ninfluential 13th- \ncentury author of such \npoetic epics as \nWillehalm, Titurel, \nParzival, and various \nTagelieder. \n\n\n\n861 \n\n\n\nRomance \n\n\n\nJohann Huizinga \n(1872-1945) Dutch \nhistorian, author of \nThe Waning of the \nMiddle Ages (1924), \nprofessor of history at \nGroningen and \nLeiden University until \nhe was arrested by \nthe Nazis in 1942. \n\n\n\nGuilhem \n\nMontanhagol Provencal \ntroubadour who took \nthe lead in raising \nideals of romantic love \nin Renaissance \npoetry. \n\n\n\nchanged his allegiance in mid-adventure, and renounced her as a \nseductress and witch. 17 \n\nRomantic literature reveals continual conflict between the min- \nstrel\'s love-oriented philosophy and the church\'s anti-love attitude. \nChurchmen said lovers became "vile" by forgetting God and making \nthe beloved woman a divinity. One priest said the bards "sinfully love \nwomen, whom they make into deities," and this was exactly the same as \nloving Satan. 18 Professor Huizinga noted that "from the side of \nreligion, maledictions were poured upon love in all its aspects." Yet the \npoets insisted that "Love was a divine visitation, quelling mere animal \nlust. . . . The lover, whose heart was rendered gentle by the discipline of \nhis lady, was initiate to a sphere of exalted realizations that no one \nwho had experienced such could possibly identify (as the church \nidentified them) with sin." 19 \n\nModern scholars have struggled to define the later stages of the \ncourtly-love movement, when the Meistersinger school was founded \nby men with the title of Frauenlob, "Lover of Women." The obvious \nspirituality of the movement led some to interpret it as a sentimental \nasceticism inspired by adoration of the virgin Mary. Yet some of the \nminstrels\' poetry was intensely even grossly erotic, focused on a \nreal female body, not an ethereal vision. Scholars failed to understand \nthis combination of spirituality and carnality because they failed to \ndiscover its historical root: the penetration of Europe by yet another \nwave of Tantric sex-worship. \n\nThe most mysterious element in courtly love was the secret \ntechnique of lovemaking known as drudaria, druerie, or karezza. It \ncan only have been a western version of Tantric maithuna, the sacra- \nment of coitus reservatus. This alone can explain its blend of erotic \nand spiritual ecstasy. Significantly, one of the heroes of courtly love \nmost revered as a model for poets was Tristan, who had reversed his \nname and called himself Tantris for the secret understanding of his lady- \nlove. 20 See Tantrism. \n\nThe poets kept their secret but obliquely referred to it when \ndefending themselves against charges of lechery. They claimed their \naim was not selfish pleasure but only gratification of the lady. Montan- \nhagol wrote, "A lover should on no account desire what would \ndishonor his lady-love," probably meaning an unwelcome pregnancy. \n"Desire never had any power over me to make me wish her to whom \nI have given myself aught that should not be. I would not reckon that a \npleasure which might debase her." Another poet said, "A true lover \nmust seek the interest of his beloved a hundred times more than his \nown." 21 \n\nThe poets were angered by certain ignorant men who copied \ncourtly-love behavior without understanding its basis. Men who \npursued women for their own sexual satisfaction were regarded as \nvulgar boors who "confounded everything by their behavior, which is \nno better than that of dogs." Men who didn\'t understand the true \n\n\n\n862 \n\n\n\ninitiation of love "adopted other maxims, which bring about shame." \nMarcabru said scornfully, "If they call that drudaria, they lie." Arnaud \nDaniel claimed to have renounced the love of wealthy women, who \nknew only pleasures of the shameful sort. "From such love as moves me \nare debarred those disloyal seekers of women who destroy courtli- \nness." 22 Courtliness was synonymous with Minnedienst, the service of \nwomen who knew how to be served. 25 \n\nWhere did the bards learn of maithuna? Probably from several \nsources. The gypsies practiced it, and gypsies infiltrated Europe from \nat least the 1 1th century on. 24 Even more influential was the Moorish- \nSaracen tradition emanating from Spain and the Middle East after \nthe crusades. Yoni-worship was preserved by such sects as the Sufis, \nwhose "Sufi Way" involved a sexual initiation by a fravashi, an occult \nlove-priestess like the Tantric shakti. Sufi sages taught that a man can \nfind spiritual fulfillment only in love, realizing Woman as "a ray of \ndeity." The word Sufi contained "in enciphered form, the concept of \nLove." Deciphered, it reduced by the Arabic numerological system \nto three letters: FUQ, meaning "that which is transcendent." 25 \n\nUnder the same language system, the title of a singer was Ta Ra B, \nwhich picked up the Spanish suffix -ador and became "troubadour." \nThus the troubadours\' worship of Love was a synthesis of pagan and \nOriental themes, founded on the idea of Woman as the true source \nof benevolence. Troubadour Bernard de Ventadorn wrote to his be- \nloved: "Noble lady, nothing do I ask of thee but that thou shouldst \ntake me for thy servant. I would serve as one serves a good lord, \nwhatever reward I might gain. Behold, I am at thy command: sincere \nand humble, gay and courteous. Neither bear nor lion art thou, to kill \nme, as I here to thee surrender." 26 Gentleness and sensuality reigned \ntogether in the mythical fairyland visited by Aucassin, a French roman- \ntic hero based on the Arabic "sultan of love," Al-Kasim. 27 \n\nMinnesingers worshipped their Goddess Minne as Love, but \nmocked the syncretism of Christian dogmas. Gottfried von Strassburg \nwrote: "The very virtuous Christ is as yielding as a wind-blown sleeve; \nhe adapts himself and goes along whatever way he is pressed, as \nreadily and easily as anyone could ask." 28 Wolfram von Eschenbach \nparodied the pope as a eunuch named Clinschor ("Clergyman") who \noffered his services to the devil. 29 Walther von der Vogelweide repri- \nmanded the clergy for their condemnation of love: \n\nWhoever says that Love is sin, \n\nLet him consider first and well: \n\nRight many virtues lodge therein \n\nWith which we all, by rights, should dwell. * \n\nMinnesinger Konrad of Megenburg wrote a scathing satire \nwhich he presented in the form of a debate between Lady Church \n(Mary-Ecclesia) and her servants, the clergy, who only pretended to \nserve her, but actually served her rival, Lady Avarice-and- Vainglory. \n\n\n\nRomance \n\n\n\nMarcabru, or \nMarcabrun One of the \nearliest Provencal \ntroubadours, of whose \nwork about 40 pieces \nsurvive, dated ca. 1135- \n1148. \n\n\n\nGottfried von \nStrassburg One of the \ngreatest medieval \nGerman poets, author \nof the epic Tristan \nund Isolde (early Bth \ncentury) and many \n, lyric poems. \n\nWalther von der \nVogelweide (ca. 1170- \n1230) Great German \nlyric poet, self-described \nas a Minnesinger, \nauthor of many love \npoems, protege of \nseveral Swabian and \nThuringian princes. \n\nKonrad von \nMegenburg German \nanti-papal imperialist \nscholar, author of \nPlanctus Ecclesie in \nGermaniam (1337) and \nDe translatione \nRomani Imperii (1354). \n\n\n\n863 \n\n\n\nRomulus and Remus Lady Church denounced her servants in most unladylike terms and \n\ncalled their real mistress " a whore, a wretched nurse of vice, a \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ superlative evil, a hypocrite." 31 \n\nOut of the courtly-love movement came one of the oddest of \nChristian pseudo-saints: St. Dymphna, a corruption of the romantic \npoet\'s name for his lady-love, madonna or ma dompna, "my mistress, \nmy lady."

See Motherhood. \n\nRomulus himself was a patriarchal invention based on an ancient \nfeminine clan name: the Etruscan gens Romulia, the real founders of \nRome. 5 \n\n1 . Lamusse, 315. 2.

The \nj usual virgin martyr myth was invented for Rosalia, but not even her \n: bones were real. The osteologist Buckland studied Rosalia\'s relics and \nI found them to be the bones of a goat. 1 Nevertheless, even after this \n! discovery, the goat\'s bones retained an undiminished power to perform \nj healing miracles that had been the speciality of Rosalia\'s shrine for \nj many centuries. \n1. White 2, 29. \n\n\n\nRosalia, Saint \nRosary \n\n\n\nRosary \n\nDominicans pretended that the rosary began with St. Dominic\'s \n"beatific vision" at the church of St. Sabina in Rome. Actually, \nChristians copied the rosary from eastern pagans. Its real origin was \nthe Hindu japamak, "rose-chaplet," called the Rosary of the Mantras \nworn by Kali Ma. Its alternately red and white beads symbolized her \nMother and Virgin forms (see Gunas). The Rosary Upanishad said the \nsounds of her mantras were white, the bead-touchings were red. 1 \nArab poets viewed both white and red roses as emblems of the female \nprinciple, and called their rosaries wardija, "rose-garden." The same \nword in Latin, rosarium, described early rosaries associated solely with \nthe cult of the virgin Mary up to the 14th century. The Litany of \nLoreto calls Mary "Queen of the Most Holy Rosary." The German \nterm Rosenkranz, "rose- wreath," was sometimes shortened to Kranz- \nlein, "little wreath," a symbol of virginity or "flower of maidenhead." 2 \nIn the east, the flower-wreath represented sacred marriage, circling \nthe "head" of the phallic god. 3 \n\nLike a portable prayer-wheel, the rosary was used everywhere to \ncount repetitive prayers or mantras. Constant repetition of such \nverbal charms was believed to bring about blissful after-life, automatic- \nally. The Book of the Dead said the spoken formula of the rosary (in \nEgypt hung with an image of Horus) was "a protection upon earth, and \nit will secure for the deceased the affection of men, gods, and the \nSpirit-souls which are perfect. Moreover it acteth as a spell in Khert- \nNeter, but it must be recited by thee on behalf of the Osiris Ra, \nregularly and continually millions of times." 4 \n\nEarly Christians at first rejected rosaries and denied the efficacy of \nconstantly repeated prayers counted on the beads. Jesus said, "When \nye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that \nthey shall be heard for their much speaking" (Matthew 6:7). Despite \nthis Gospel directive, however, Christians eventually adopted the hea- \nthen custom of "vain repetitions" along with the heathen rose-wreath \n\n\n\nUpanishads Buddhist \nscriptures representing \nthe final stage in Vedic \nthought, dealing with \nthe philosophy known \nas Vedanta. The Katha \nUpanishad discusses \ntransmigration of souls, \nthe nature of eternal \nlife, the doctrine of \nmaya, and an account \nof a visit to Yama, Lord \nof the Dead. \n\nBook of the Dead \n\nCommon name for the \ncollection of \nEgyptian funerary \npapyri written \nbetween 1500 and 1350 \nB.C., including \nVignettes, Hymns, \nChapters, and \ndescriptive Rubrics. \nAmong the best- \npreserved, and most \ntypical, copies of the \nTheban Recension of \nthe Book of the \nDead is the much- \nstudied Papyrus of \nAni. \n\n\n\n865 \n\n\n\nitself, relating both to their own version of the Great Mother just as the \nHindus related them to Kali Ma. To this day, the user of the rosary \nappeals most often to Mary, imploring her to be present at his death, \njust as the Tantric sages implored Kali-Shakti. \n\nAssociation of the rosary with death is still found in the archaic \nreligion of Tibet, where rosaries sometimes had beads made of \nhuman skull bone, recalling the rosary of skulls worn by Kali the \nDestroyer. In a remarkable parallel, Christian rosaries were some- \ntimes made of tiny skulls carved from bone or ivory. Many eastern \nrosaries had a retaining bead formed like a vase, said to give birth to \nthe other beads. In the west, both the pagan Goddess and the virgin \nMary the primary object of rosary worship were known as the \nHoly Vase. 5 \n\nMohammedan rosaries usually contained 99 beads, one for each ol \n\nAllah\'s miracle-working names (see Name). Smaller rosaries were \n\nmade of 33 beads, with 3 groups of 1 1 set apart by markers, probably in \n\nimitation of the Vedic tradition of 33 gods divided into 3 companies \n\nof 1 1 each. 6 Arabs sometimes called the rosary Gulistan, the Rose \n\nGarden, which was also the title of a mystical work by Sufi poet Saadi \n\nof Shiraz, a Goddess-worshipper of the 13th century a.d. Europe\'s \n\nheraldic "gules," meaning red, came from the Arabic word for \n\n"rose." 7 \n\nl.Wilkins, 44, 194,201. 2. Wilkins, 40, 42, 151. 3. Larousse, 335. \n\n4. Book of the Dead, 567. 5.

Shah, 98. \n\n\n\nRose \n\nThe rosary was an instrument of worship of the Rose, which ancient \nRome knew as the Flower of Venus, and the badge of her sacred \nprostitutes. 1 Things spoken "under the rose" (sub rosa) were part of \nVenus\'s sexual mysteries, not to be revealed to the uninitiated. 2 The red \nrose represented full-blown maternal sexuality; the white rose or lily \nwas a sign of the Virgin Goddess. Christians transferred both of these \\ \nsymbolic flowers to the virgin Mary and called her the Holy Rose. \n\nRose windows in Gothic cathedrals faced west, the direction of the \nmatriarchal paradise, and were primarily dedicated to Mary as the \nfemale symbol opposing the male cross in the eastern apse. At Chartres, \nthe window called Rose of France showed "in its center the Virgin in \n\nher majesty Round her in a circle, are twelve medallions; four \n\ncontaining doves; four six-winged angels or Thrones; four angels of a \nlower order, but all symbolizing the gifts and endowments of the Queen \nof Heaven." Beneath, the Marian number of five windows centered \non Mary\'s mother, "the greatest central figure, the tallest and most \ncommanding in the whole church." 3 \n\nFive was the Marian number because it was the number of petals! \nin the rose, and also in the apple blossom another virginity-symbol \n\n\n\n866 \n\n\n\ngiving rise to the five lobes of the mature apple, the corresponding Rose \n\nsymbol of motherhood, fruition, regeneration, and eternal life. Five was \n\nconsidered "proper to Marian devotion" because Rose-Mary was the ^^^mm^^mi^^^m \n\nreincarnation of Apple-Eve. Christian mystical art showed apples and \n\nroses growing together on the Tree of Life in Mary\'s "enclosed garden" \n\nof virginity. \n\nThe fivefold rose and apple were also related to numerous pre- \nChristian images of the Goddess, the witches\' pentacle, the \nfive-pointed Star of Ishtar, and the Egyptian symbol of the uterine \nunderworld and cyclic rebirth. Mysteries of the Rose belonged to \nAphrodite, according to the poet Nossis: "Anyone the Cyprian does not \nlove, knows not what flowers her roses are." Aphrodite was repre- \nsented by a Rose-Mary plant, named for her as rosmarina, the Dew of \nthe Sea. 4 \n\nIn the great age of cathedral-building, when Mary was worshipped \nas a Goddess in her "Palaces of the Queen of Heaven" or Notre- \nDarnes, she was often addressed as the Rose, Rose-bush, Rose-garland, \nRose-garden, Wreath of Roses, Mystic Rose, or Queen of the Most \nHoly Rose-garden. 5 The church, the garden, and Mary\'s body were all \nmystically one; for she was Lady Ecclesia, the Church, as well as "the \npure womb of regeneration." Like a pagan temple, the Gothic cathedral \nrepresented the body of the Goddess who was also the universe, \ncontaining the essence of male godhood within herself. This was largely \nforgotten after the passing of the Gothic period. In later centuries, \n"Gothic" became an epithet of contempt, synonymous with "barba- \nrous." The symbolism of the Palaces of the Queen of Heaven was no \nlonger understood. By the 18th century, its secrets were as obscure as \nthe crypto-erotic art of the temples of India. 6 \n\nIn fact it was in India that the Great Mother, whose body was \nthe temple, was first addressed as Holy Rose. 7 The "Flower of the \nGoddess" was the scarlet China rose. 8 This was sometimes identified \nwith the mystic Kula flower, source of a virgin\'s menstrual blood, \nrepresenting the life of her future children and her bond of union \nwith the past maternal spirit of her clan. 9 \n\nThe eastern World Tree was often envisioned as a family rose- \ntree, a female Tree of Life and Immortality. In central Asia the tree \nwas called Woman, the Wellspring, Milk, Animals, Fruits. "The \nCosmic Tree always presents itself as the very reservoir of life and the \nmaster of destinies." Mongols knew the tree as Zambu, whose roots \nplunge to the base of Mount Sumer; it is the Mother-tree whose \nfruits feed the gods. 10 Zambu was undoubtedly the same as the Hindu \nparadise, Jambu Island, home of the cosmic Rose-Apple tree. The \nisland was shaped like a yoni. In its "diamond seat" (a symbolic clitoris), \none could be reborn as a human being with keen intelligence. 11 \n\nJudeo-Christian tradition associated this tree of ancestors with a \nmale Tree of Life (genitalia), regarding male ancestry as the only \nimportant kind. The genealogy of Christ was depicted in medieval art as \n\n\n\n867 \n\n\n\nRose \n\n\n\na tree-phallus rising from the loins of a recumbent Jesse, with its \nflowers and fruit surrounding the figures of David, Mary, and Jesus. \nStill, mystics generally assigned feminine gender to the rose-tree, \nrose-garden, rose-wreath, etc., fully realizing that these were genital \nsymbols. The medieval scholar Pierre Col said the Gospel of Luke \nrepresented the Holy Rose as a sign of the vulva. 12 \n\nBritain had a traditional Mummers\' dance known as The Rose: \nfive dancers formed a five-pointed star of swords over a victim, called \nthe Fool, who was symbolically slain and resurrected with a mysterious \nelixir, the Golden Frosty Drop, or Dewdrop in the Rose. This was \nsimply a western version of the Jewel in the Lotus: i.e., a seminal drop \nin the female flower. It is said the " \'garden\' may symbolize the \nuterus, as \'scarlet flower\' may signify the vulva." The Frosty Drop, or \ndew, signified the semen of the God reincarnating himself in the \nGoddess. The Bible says dew was a poetic synonym for semen (Song of \nSolomon 5:2). Meister Eckhart understood quite well the sexual \nsignificance of both dew and rose when he wrote, "And as in the \nmorning the rose opens, receiving the dew from heaven and the sun, \nso Mary\'s soul did open and receive Christ the heavenly dew." 1? \n\nThe dance called The Rose seems to have been a pagan ritual so \nvital that it couldn\'t be suppressed. The accompanying chant was \n"ring-around-the-rose-wreath"; in German, Ringel Ringel Rosenkranz; \nin English, Ring-Around-A-Rosy. 14 The "pocket full of posies" in \nthe nursery rhyme probably referred to the cave of flowers, an old \nsymbol of the underground Fairyland. The final instruction, "All fall \ndown," was the behest of Morgan the Grim Reaper, or Mother Death \nbringing an end to the fertility season. According to Danish folk \ncustom, roses decorated sacred groves for the dances of Midsummer \nEve, which had to be guarded by armed men against possible \nintruders: \n\nMidsummer night upon the sward, \nKnights and squires are standing guard; \nIn the grove a knightly dance they tread \nWith torches and garlands of roses red. I5 \n\nThe Rose was likened not only to Mary but to other surviving \nforms of the pagan Goddess. As Spenser\'s Faerie Queene she had a \nBower of Bliss signifying her sexual nature, where the central holy of \nholies was the Rose of Love. 16 Medieval myths of Lady Briar Rose \npictured the Virgin as a rose in the midst of a thorn bush, a sexual \nimage established long ago by the poet Sedulius: \n\nAs blooms among the thorns the lovely rose, herself without a thorn, \nThe glory of the bush whose crown she is, \nSo, springing from the root of Eve, Mary the new Maiden \nAtoned for the sin of that first Maiden longago.\' 7 \n\nNo matter how consistently the Rose was assimilated to Mary, it \nwas obviously a sexual symbol of Goddess- worship brought back to \n\n\n\n868 \n\n\n\nEurope from Arabia with the returning crusaders. 18 Sufi mystics in Rudra \n\nArabia wrote romantic-religious works centering on the rosary and the \n\nRose. Fariduddin Attar\'s Parliament of the Birds explained the ^^^^^^^^^^^ m \n\nsymbol in the words of the "passionate nightingale": \n\nI know the secrets of Jove. Throughout the night I give my love call . . . It \nis I who set the Rose in motion, and move the hearts of lovers. \nContinuously I teach new mysteries. . . . When the Rose returns to the \nworld in Summer, I open my heart to joy. My secrets are not known to \nall but the Rose knows them. I think of nothing but the Rose; I wish \nnothing but the ruby Rose. . . . Can the nightingale live but one night \nwithout the Beloved? \' 9 \n\nThis Eros-nightingale reappeared in European romances as the \nSpirit of the Rose, or a "devil" named Rosier in the 17th century. \nAccording to the exorcist Father Sebastien Michaelis, the devil \nRosier whispers sweet words that tempt men to fall in love. Rosier\'s \nheavenly adversary was St. Basil, "who would not listen to amorous \nand enchanting language." 20 Still later, the same devil became the hero \nof the classical ballet Le Spectre de la Rose in which he tempts a \nyoung girl to fall in love. \n\nSometimes the male Spirit of the Rose was a briar rose with \n\n"pricking" thorns. "Pricking flesh to acquire blood artificially is the \n\nonly way that men can \'produce\' it. In the European romantic legend of \n\ntwo heterosexual lovers, the female red rose is paired with the male \n\nbriar, or \'prick.\' Prick, when used as a slang, taboo name for the penis, is \n\na descriptive-magical term for access-to-power. . . . The briar is the \n\nmale rose." 21 \n\n1. Wilkins, 108, 136. 2. Hazlitt, 527. 3. Campbell, M.I., 235. 4. Wilkins, 108, 1 10, 133. \n5. Wilkins, 93, 106. 6. de Riencourt, 261. 7. Wilkins, 44. 8.

The Maruts became similar flayed gods or red gods \nin the west e.g. Mars the red god, and his Phrygian counterpart \nMarsyas, the flayed satyr, hung on a pine tree and sacrificed to Apollo. \nSatyrs were goat gods, and goats were typical victims of flaying- \nsacrifices for atonement in Rome (e.g., the Lupercalia), Phrygia, Syria, \nand Mesopotamia. \n\nRudra was also called Tryambaka, "He Who Belongs to Three \nMother Goddesses." 2 Like Shiva after him, he seems to have been \noffered to the original female trinity. Like Shiva also, he merged with \n\n\n\n869 \n\n\n\nRunes her or them and became known as an androgynous Lord Who is \n\nHalf Woman.\' \n\nHis name passed into Latin as "rude," meaning a primitive deity of \n\nwild animals and woodlands, a typical satyr. 4 Thus it might be said \nthat Rudra was the prototype of all the primitive Aryan gods of fertility \nand death. \n\n1.0\'Flaherty,357. 2.

Runic letters appear first in the hands of \nthe Goddess Idun, keeper of the gods\' magic apples of immortality. \nShe gave runes to her consort Bragi by engraving them on his tongue; \nthus he acquired the magic of words and became the first wizard-king \nof skaldic poetry. \n\nOdin received knowledge of the runes by his self-sacrifice, hanging \non the gallows-tree Yggdrasil for nine nights that is, for a nofnden, \nthe traditional lying-in period for a woman in childbirth. In the old \nmyths, self-sacrifice or suicide was often demanded as the price of \nmale acquisition of feminine wisdom. This also meant a journey to \nparadise (Fairyland), and godlike immortality. \n\nOdin died to acquire the runes for men; but men were expected to \nimitate his sacrifice, as Christian martyrs imitated that of Christ. If a \nNorse hero couldn\'t die in battle, which would automatically make him \na son of Odin, then he could commit a kind of hara-kiri by carving \nthe runes in his own flesh and bleeding to death. 1 In this manner Sigurd \nRing summoned the Valkyries to take him to Valholle: "Bravely he \nslashes Odin\'s red letters, blood-runes of heroes, on arm and breast." 2 \n\nThe festal day of a hero\'s death thus became a "red-letter day," \nmarked in red on runic calendars, as modern calendars still print \nSundays and holidays in red. Special sacrificial runes called geirs-odd \nwere recommended for ceremonial suicide. These enabled the hero \nto compose his own death-song in his final "inspiration" (literally, \n"breath"). Skaldic tradition associated poetry with blood. The Mead \nof the Poets was also called the Sea of Odin\'s Breast, meaning the blood \nthat flowed from his breast when he was pierced on the Rood. \n\nThe nursery-rhyme figure of slain Cock Robin Redbreast descend- \ned from the folklore of the geirs-odd. Robin was the God of the \nWitches, frequently identified with Odin, sacrificed in a sacred grove to \nMarian the Virgin, whom the Northmen called Maerin and wor- \nshipped with blood sacrifices at Trondheim as late as the 1 1th century. 3 \nRobin Redbreast appeared as a human martyr in an old Danish \nballad. He won the love of a bird-maiden (Valkyrie) by cutting slices of \nflesh from his breast for her, and she took him to paradise. "The \n\n\n\n870 \n\n\n\nyouth has now got his reward, safely has he won from harm; at night he Rusalki \n\nsleeps full joyously within his truelove\'s arms." 4 \n\nThe death song composed by Ragnar Lodbrok for himself presents ^^^^^^^^^^^ \na pagan version of a runic epitaph, supposed to be sung by the \nbleeding man with his final breath, like the song of a dying swan; \nindeed, runes and swan-princes were often associated. Ragnar sang, \nwith a certain gallantry: \n\nCease, my strain! I hear a voice \nFrom realms where martial souls rejoice; \nI hear the maids of slaughter call, \nWho bid me hence to Odin \'s hall: \nHigh seated in their blest abodes \nI soon shall quaff the drink of gods. \nThe hours of life have glided by; \nI fall, but smiling shall I die. 5 \n\nKnowing the runes of heathen alphabets were connected with \ndeath charms and mysterious curses, Christians came to regard the \nrunes as devilish. They believed witches could cause death by \n"casting the runes." But the original purpose of casting runes was \ndivination, in a system not essentially different from casting yarrow \nstalks of the I Ching, or casting "the lot of rods" in medieval churches, \nor casting dice as magic knucklebones, or shuffling Tarot cards. The \nrunes were scratched on wooden shingles or chips, like dice, and these \nwere thrown in certain patterns. The process of interpreting them \nwas raedan, "reading"; the result was raedelsox "riddles." In old- \nfashioned usage, "reading" meant to solve a riddle. 6 From the runes \ncame such English construction as "read me this riddle," and the use of \n"reading" to mean fortune-telling. \n\nI.

During Rusalki Week at the beginning \nof summer, they would emerge from the waters by moonlight and \ndance.

Churchmen said witches held four Great Sabbats a \nyear "in derision of the four annual festivals of the Church"; but the \nchurch had copied these from the pagans in the first place. 2 They were: \n(1) Candlemas Eve; (2) May Eve, or Walpurgisnacht; (3) Lammas \nEve; and (4) Halloween. Some lists included Midsummer (the Feast of \n\n\n\n874 \n\n\n\nSt. John) and the solstitial festival on December 2 1 (the Feast of St. Sabbat, Witches\' \n\nThomas). 3 \n\nDetails were drawn from classical descriptions of Roman fertility ^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\nfestivals, such as the Bacchanalia, Saturnalia, Lupercalia, etc. At the \nancient ceremony of purification for the New Year, in the Lupercal \ngrotto where Lupa the She-Wolf was said to have suckled Romulus \nand Remus, he-goats were sacrificed and youths were touched with the \nblood; priests in raw goatskins struck women\'s hands with strips of \ngoatskin as a fertility charm; men and women exchanged clothing and \nengaged in orgiastic sex. Late in the 5th century, this Lupercalia was \nadopted into the Christian calendar and renamed the Feast of Purifica- \ntion of the Virgin. 4 \n\nOther pagan practices supposedly incorporated into the witches\' \nsabbat included widdershins (counterclockwise) dancing in a ring, in \nhonor of the Moon-goddess; wearing masks; jumping over fires; sacrifi- \ncial feasting; worshipping trees, springs, and sacred stones; and \nmaking lewd jokes and horseplay in a carnival atmosphere. Indeed the \nCarnival, or Feast of Fools, descended from pagan holidays when the \nsocial order was temporarily reversed, and everything was done back- \nward, a prototype of the "reverse Christianity" of the Black Mass. \nThe Saturnalia was still kept by medieval Christians in this manner: \n\nThe priests of a church elected a bishop of fools, who came in full pomp, \nplacing himself in the episcopal seat in the choir. High mass then \nbegan; all the ecclesiastics assisted, their faces smeared with blacking, or \ncovered with a hideous or ridiculous mask. During the course of the \ncelebration, some of them, dressed like mountebanks or in women \'s \nclothes, danced in the middle of the choir, singing clownish or obscene \nsongs. Others ate sausages or puddings from the altar, played at cards or at \ndice in front of the officiating priest, incensed him with the censer, or, \nburning old shoes, made him breathe the smoke. s \n\nSuch carnival clownishness was "simply the last form which the \nPriapeia and Liberalia assumed in Western Europe, and in its various \ndetails all the incidents of those great and licentious orgies of the \nRomans were reproduced." 6 However, certain authorities came to \nperceive such revels as profoundly evil. In 1445 the Paris Faculty of \nTheology called for reform, writing to the French bishops a puritanical- \nly shocked description of pre- Lenten customs: "Priests and clerks \nmay be seen wearing masks and monstrous visages at the hours of office. \nThey dance in the choir dressed as women, panders or minstrels. \nThey sing wanton songs. They eat black puddings at the horn of the \naltar while the celebrant is saying Mass. They play at dice there. \nThey cense with stinking smoke from the soles of old shoes. They run \nand leap through the church, without a blush at their own shame." 7 \n\nCopies of letters like this one, drawn from the archives, surely gave \nthe Inquisition\'s judges many ideas for details of the Sabbat that they \nput in the mouths of their victims, and confirmed by torture. With only \n\n\n\n875 \n\n\n\nSad minimal imagination, a judge could reverse any ordinary church \n\n\n\nSacred \n\n\n\nservice and accuse his victim of kissing the devil\'s anus (instead of the \nbishop\'s ring), eating children\'s corpses and drinking menstrual blood \n(instead of bread and wine), saying the prayers backward, making the \nsign of the cross with the left foot instead of the right hand, addressing \nsubterranean deities instead of celestial ones, and so on. \n\nWeekly sabbats were supposed to be held on Friday, once a lunar \n"Eve" of the original sabbath, the day of Saturn or of Zeus Sabazius. \nFriday was the day sacred to Venus-Freya, and after sunset it was the \nJews\' sabbath day, both of which made it a bad or unlucky day in \nChristian opinion. Friday the 13th was especially ill-favored. \n\nl.Ravensdale& Morgan, 153; Shah, 210. 2. Knight, D.W.P., 225. 3. Robbins,415. \n4. Larousse, 208. 5. Crawley, 333. 6. Knight, D.W.P., 207. 7.

O\'Flaherty, 351. 2. Larousse, 36. \n\n\n\nSacred \n\nDerivation of Latin sacer, which meant "untouchable" in the dual \nsense of both holy and unclean. A sacer person or thing was set aside for \na divine purpose; it was taboo, dedicated to the other world, shunned \nby ordinary folk because of its dangerous charge of spiritual mana. A \ncase in point is the biblical story of Uzzah, who dared to seize the ark \nof the covenant to keep it from falling off its oxcart. Though Uzzah\'s \nintentions were entirely honorable, God struck him dead for touching \nthe sacer object (2 Samuel 6:3). Priests knew a special insulating charm \nwhereby they could approach the Holy of Holies without deadly risk: \n"When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash \nwith water, that they die not" (Exodus 30:20). This same insulating \ncharm was used throughout the centuries in Catholic churches, where \npeople dipped their fingers in the stoup of holy water and made a self- \nprotective sign of the cross. \n\nThe biblical word "unclean" also meant sacer. Menstrual blood \nand parturient women were "unclean" because filled with mysteri- \nous, dangerous magic (Leviticus 15). Sacrificial victims, set aside for \nconsumption by the gods, were sacer. Certain animals were "unclean" \n\n\n\n876 \n\n\n\nexcept when eaten on ceremonial occasions, like the sacred bulls of Sacrifice \n\nEgypt and the pigs of Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine. Lucian said the \n\npigs kept in the temple at Hierapolis were taboo in the typical ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ndualistic sense, both "unclean" and sacred. 1 Simple people everywhere \n\nstill demonstrate fear in the presence of whatever they consider \n\nsacred: the common emotion Coleridge called "holy dread." \n\n1. Crawley 1,1 14. \n\n\n\nSacrifice \n\n\n\nHuman or animal, the sacrificial victims of ancient cultures were \nalmost invariably male. Worshippers of Shiva sacrificed only male \nanimals; the god himself ordered that female animals must never be \nslain. 1 Males were expendable, for there were always too many for a \nproper breeding stock. \n\nThe same was true even of human sacrifices, which were men, not \nwomen. "The fertility of a group is determined by the number of its \nadult women, rather than by its adult men." 2 Therefore male blood \nonly was poured out on the earliest altars, in imitation of the female \nblood that gave "life." That is why totemic animal-ancestors were more \noften paternal than maternal. The animals\' blood and flesh, ingested \nby women, was thought to beget human offspring; and the rule was \n"Whatever is killed becomes father." 3 The victim was also god, and \nking. \n\nAmazonian Sacae or Scythians founded the Sacaea festivals of \nBabylon, where condemned criminals died as sacrificial surrogates for \nthe king, to mitigate the earlier custom of king-killing. The chosen \nvictim was a sacred king, identified with the real king in every possible \nway. He wore the king\'s robes, sat on the king\'s throne, lay with the \nroyal concubines, wielded the scepter. After five days he was stripped, \nscourged, then hanged or impaled "between heaven and earth," in a \nprototype of the crucifixion ceremony later extended to sacred kings \nof the Jews. 4 The object of scourging and piercing was to make the \npseudo-king shed tears and blood for fertility magic. 5 Babylonian \nscriptures said, "If the king does not weep when struck, the omen is bad \nfor the year." 6 The king or pseudo-king "became God" as soon as he \nwas dead. He ascended into heaven and united himself with the \nHeavenly Father, i.e., the original totem father, or first victim. 7 \nProbably the promise of apotheosis and privileged immortality induced \nvictims to accept death willingly, even as the same kind of promise \nattracted Christian martyrs. \n\nWhen ritual murder of kings or human king-surrogates came to be \nconsidered crude and uncivilized, then animal victims took their \nplace. Ceremonies were invented to identify the animal with the man. \nThe Egyptians, for instance, "put off their dead with counterfeits, \noffered an animal to their gods instead of a man, but they symbolized \n\n\n\n877 \n\n\n\nSacrifice their intended act by marking the creature to be slain with a seal \n\nbearing the image of a man bound and kneeling, with a sword at his \n\n^^^^^^^a throat." 8 \n\nPigs were often set aside as sacer victims in Egypt, India, and the \nMiddle East, which explains why their flesh was taboo to the Jews. \nThe sacrificial boar-god Vishnu had many western counterparts, such as \nAres, the boarskin-clad consort of Aphrodite, whose children Phobos \n(Fear), Deimos (Horror), and Harmonia (Peace) may have represented \nthe three stages of the sacred drama from the victim\'s point of \nview. 9 \n\nMeat was not to be wasted, so early theologians were anxious to \ninvent ways to pretend the sacrifice was politely offered to the deity, \nwhile they actually kept it for their own consumption. The usual \nmethod was to offer the deity only inedible portions of the animal, or \nportions that couldn\'t be readily collected and used, such as blood. \n"Kosher killing," draining the blood from a sacrificed animal, was not \na Jewish idea. It was a common Oriental method of offering the \nanimal\'s blood to the Great Earth Mother while the worshipper kept \nthe meat for himself. 10 The Jews, like the Hindus, taught that the \nanimal\'s soul was in its blood (Leviticus 17:1 1). \n\nGreeks assumed their gods resented being deprived of the best part \nof the sacrifice, but they avoided guilt by blaming Zeus\'s ancient rival, \nthe titan Prometheus. When the first sacrificial bull was butchered, \nPrometheus sorted it into a portion of bones concealed under fat, and \nanother portion of meat hidden under the entrails, and invited Zeus to \nchoose his portion on behalf of all the gods. Zeus chose the fat, and \nlater raged helplessly when he found he had been tricked. 11 But this \nbecame the standard fare for the gods, even Yahweh: "the fat of the \nbeast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord" \n(Leviticus 7:25). \n\nJews were even more parsimonious with their offerings than the \nGreeks. Sometimes Yahweh didn\'t even get the fat of the beast. All \nhe got was a smell of it. Levite priests legalized the "wave offering," \nwhich meant the goodies were waved in front of the altar, then eaten \nby the priests: "the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the \nLord . . . but the breast shall be Aaron\'s and his sons\' " (Leviticus \n7:30-3 1). The Jews however did retain a custom of human sacrifice, for \nspecial occasions, longer than any other people in the sphere of \ninfluence of the Roman empire. 12 Out of this tradition arose the figure \nof the dying Christos in Jerusalem. \n\nConcerning the biblical concept of sacrifice, E.C. Stanton wrote: \n"The people have always been deluded with the idea that what they \ngave to the church and the priesthood was given unto the Lord, as if the \nmaker of the universe needed anything at our hands. How incongru- \nous the idea of an Infinite being who made all the planets and the \ninhabitants thereof commanding his creatures to kill and burn animals \nfor offerings to him. It is truly pitiful to see the deceptions that have \n\n\n\n878 \n\n\n\nbeen played upon the people in all ages and countries by the priests Saga \n\nin the name of religion." n Saints \n\n\n\nI.

Helene, or Feu de S. Herme: Fire of \nthe Holy Helen or the Holy Hermes. In Spain it was known as St. \nHelmes or St. Telmes fire, regarded as a form of witchfire, like the \nFata Morgana (marsh gas). 1 In fact it is a static discharge from points \nsuch as masts and spars of a ship, or from the wings of earlier \nairplanes. \n\nAccording to some sea stories, if one flame appears, it is Helen, \nwho presages bad weather; if two flames appear, they are Helen\'s \nbrothers Castor and Pollux, who indicate that the weather will clear, and \nalso that even sea-myths demonstrate patriarchal bias. Other names \nfor the mysterious light are Corposant from Italian corpo santo, \nChrist\'s body St. Anne\'s Light, and even Saint Electricity. 2 \n\nSaint Elmo was entirely mythical. Some scholars claimed he was \nthe same as St. Erasmus of Syria, who was also mythical, his legend \nbased only on a spurious "Acts" written three centuries after his alleged \nmartyrdom. It was claimed that he died of having his intestines \nwound out of his body onto a windlass; therefore his symbol in sacred \nart was a windlass. Through this tenuous link, he became a patron \nsaint of sailors. 3 But since he probably never existed at all, the point is \nonly academic. \n\n1. Hazlitt, 94. 2. Jobes, 180. 3. Attwater, 117. \n\n\n\nSaints \n\nCanonization of saints was a Christian extension of the ancient Greco- \nRoman custom of apotheosis (god-making), whereby mortals could \nbecome immortal and live forever in heaven through identification with \n\n\n\n879 \n\n\n\nSaints a deity. The liturgy and forms of canonization were taken from the \n\npagans, including the ceremonial release of bird-souls to represent the \ndeified one flying to heaven to join the other immortals. 1 \n\nThe canon of saints made Christianity in effect a form of polythe \nism, just as the similar system of multiplying bodhisattvas created a \nBuddhist polytheism. Medieval Europeans wanted many deities, not \none. Thus, in medieval churches, "the life of Christ fills a smaller \nplace and is told with far less complacence than are the lives of the \nsaints." 2 Much time and effort were expended to ascertain the right \nsaint or saints to answer any particular kind of appeal. \n\nThe mythical saints included numerous transformations of the \nGreat Goddess under names that were only her various pagan titles, \nin the same way as the Judeo-Christian God was called "Almighty" or \n"Ancient of Days" or "Lord." Among the sainted Goddess-names \nwere Mari, Marina, Margaret, Aphra, Venerina, Martina, Mary of \nEgypt, the Three Marys, Aphrodite, Demetra, and such title-names \nas Irene, Philomena, Reine, Pelagia, Corona, Rosalia, Sophia, Eugenia, \nViviana, Columba (Peace, Moon-lover, Queen, Sea, Crown, Holy \nRose, Wisdom, Health, Life, Dove). 3 \n\nDiana Ilithyia was canonized as St. Yllis. Artemis became St. \nArtemidos. Keraunos the thunder-serpent became St. Ceraunos. \nCastor and Pollux were transformed into Sts. Cosmas and Damianus, \nwhose images replaced those of the pagan Heavenly Twins in their \nhealing shrine at Aegaeae. Sts. Sebastian and Hubert, patrons of archers \nand hunting dogs, were once pagan Lords of the Hunt; so was St. \nEustace, allegedly converted by Christ who spoke to him from the horns \nof a magic stag. 4 \n\nThe sun god Helios became St. Elias. Gods and heroes like \nBacchus, Dionysus, Hyacinthus, Narcissus, Nereus, and Achilles \nwere canonized under their own names. Mercury became a warrior- \nsaint, supposedly sent from heaven to assassinate the emperor Julian, \n"the Apostate." Under his other name, Hermes, he was canonized by \nthe spurious passio of Pope Alexander I. The satyr-god Silvanus was \ncanonized, and called a son of the equally fictitious St. Felicity. 5 Even \nBuddha became a Christian saint, disguised as St. Josaphat (Bodisat). 6 \n\nAs St. Aphra or Afra, Aphrodite appeared in the role of a repentant \nprostitute, embracing martyrdom to atone for her promiscuous be- \nhavior. She was quoted as saying, "My body has sinned, let it suffer." \nShe was burned to death on an island in the river Lech meaning \nthat the Goddess\'s image was burned in its former Temple of Lechery. \n\nA late absurdity was the canonization of the Goddess\'s Holy Vial \nas an anthropomorphic saint, which one 18th-century historian \nreferred to as St. Ampoule. 8 \n\nAbout the beginning of the 9th century, bones, teeth, hair, \ngarments, and other relics of fictitious saints were conveniently \n"found" all over Europe and Asia and triumphantly installed in the \nreliquaries of every church, until all Catholic Europe was falling to its \n\n\n\n880 \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\n\nknees before what Calvin called its anthill of bones. 9 Martyrs\' remains Saints \n\nbecame extremely valuable, as Gibbon says: "The satisfactory experi- \nence that the relics of saints were more valuable than gold or precious ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nstones stimulated the clergy to multiply the treasures of the church. \nWithout much regard for truth or probability, they invented names for \nskeletons, and actions for names." 10 Myths invented for the fictitious \nrelics of the evangelists provide typical examples. \n\nSome Venetian merchants pretended to find the bones of St. Mark \nin Alexandria in 81 5. They brought their find home to Venice and \nsold it to the municipal treasury. A great church was built over the bones \nin the Square of St. Mark who was only associated with the city in \nthe first place because the original municipal totem was a lion, and the \nevangelist was assigned to the season of Leo in the pagan calendar. \nThe bones remain in Venice to this day, for the fiction has not yet been \nrenounced. \n\nIn like manner, the bones of "St. Matthew" were dug up in \nParthia at Hierapolis, and carried to a church in Salerno in 1080 a.d., \nat the height of the early saint-making fad. Matthew\'s legend was \ninvented by Pope Gregory VII, who claimed to have learned by \ndivine inspiration of the apostle\'s travels through Egypt, Ethiopia, and \nother places, and of the miracles he worked to shame the poor magic \nof pagan magicians. 11 St. Luke was touted as one of the ancient world\'s \nmost prolific artists, to judge from the numerous portraits of the \nVirgin, painted by him, that appeared in many churches. Some still \nremain, despite ample proof that all such portraits were actually \npainted during the Middle Ages. 12 \n\nConversion of pagan gods and goddesses to saints usually accom- \npanied the church\'s takeover of their shrines. An example is the \nso-called Isle of Saints whose sacred inhabitants were not saints at all but \nwomen called Gallicenae, former priestesses of the Gallic oracle. \nPomponius Mela, Latin geographer of the 1st century a.d., said they \nwere "holy in perpetual virginity, said to be nine in number, with \nsingular powers, so as to raise by their charms the winds and seas, to turn \nthemselves into what animals they will, to cure wounds and diseases \nincurable by others, to know and predict the future; but this they do \nonly to navigators who go thither purposely to consult them." 15 \n\nLike pagan oracles and wise-women, sacrificial gods were also \nconverted into saints. The Blutritt (blood rite) of northern heathens was \neasily transformed into a Christian ceremony by simple substitution \nof the blood of Christ or the relic of a local saint, the former god. A \n10th-century ecclesiastical decree in Westphalia ordered that "every \nyear, on the second day of Whitsuntide, with the grace of the Holy \nGhost, ye shall bear the patron saint of your cloister church in a long \nprocession through your parochial district. . . . This processional will \ncause the seed of the fields to grow more abundantly, and the \nharshness of the weather will be subdued." H \n\nIn the old shrines of Great Mother Cybele at Acrae in Sicily, \n\n\n\n881 \n\n\n\nSaints rock-cut niches dating from the 3rd century B.C. sheltered numerous \n\nfigures of the Goddess, some dating from a much earlier period. After \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Christian conquest of the area, the Goddess\'s figures became known as \nSantoni, "saints," and are so called to this day. 15 \n\nPseudo-saints often retained jurisdiction over those departments of \nnature that they ruled as pagan deities. St. Medardus controlled the \nrain, and during droughts his statue was drenched with water to \nstimulate him to action. St. Caesarius of Aries was identified with \nBoreas, god of the north wind. In the valley of Vaison his holy glove was \nsaid to hold the air that let loose winds and storms, so his power \nactually approximated that of Satan who was Prince of the Power of the \nAir. 16 \n\nThe church that slaughtered the heathen for worshipping false \ngods was itself guilty of worshipping false saints which, sometimes, \nwere even the same deities as those of the heathen. This became so \nobvious in the 8th century that the Synod of Leptinnes had to \nprohibit the offering of sacrifices to saints instead of to God. 17 \n\nChristians surpassed their pagan ancestors in credulity, propagating \nand believing saintly miracle-tales apparently without any limitations. \nPope Gregory the Great wrote a book of saints\' lives filled with \nimpossible feats. St. Honoratus for example halted in mid-air a giant \nboulder that was rolling down a mountainside toward his monastery \nsimply by making the sign of the cross at it. The monk Maurus \nwalked on water, like Jesus and St. Peter. 18 In fact, the miracles \nattributed to Jesus were negligible compared to the wonders per- \nformed by saints. Angobard wrote in the 9th century, "The wretched \nworld lies now under the tyranny of foolishness; things are believed \nby Christians of such absurdity as no one ever could aforetime induce \nthe heathen to believe." 19 \n\nThe church never lost sight of practical common sense on one \npoint, however; saints were leading sources of its income, thanks to \nthe mandatory pilgrimage system, donations, and tithes. Gold, silver, \nand gems were collected to house and adorn the precious relics. An \necclesiastical chronicler of Trier related how the priests buried the \nchurch\'s treasures to hide them from attacking Norsemen, "so that \nthe relics might not be mocked and jeered at by the barbarians." 20 Of \ncourse the real fear was not mockery of the relics, but robbery of their \nvaluable vessels. \n\nSome genuine flesh-and-blood saints achieved their canonization \nby adding to the wealth of the church through trickery. A common \ntrick seems to have been manipulation of the popular belief in ghosts. \nSt. Fridolin of Sakingen claimed for the church the property of a \ndeceased Count Urso, on the ground that Urso had promised it to the \nchurch while receiving the last rites from Fridolin. But the property \nhad passed into the hands of Urso\'s heir, his brother Landolf, and there \n\n\n\n882 \n\n\n\nwas no document to prove Fridolin\'s claim. However, the saint won Saints \n\nhis case by summoning Count Urso himself to rise from the grave and \n\nappear before the judges, testifying "in sepulchral tones" that Lan- ^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\ndolf \'s holdings must be turned over to the monastery. The unfortunate \n\nLandolf lost not only his inheritance, but also his life. Fridolin \n\nbecame the patron saint of Sakingen and was buried in the church he \n\nbuilt with the dead man\'s money. 21 \n\nThe same thing happened in the case of St. Stanislaus the Martyr, \nBishop of Cracow, who managed some "very ample estates" belong- \ning to a man named Peter. After Peter\'s death, his heirs claimed the \n| estates, but the bishop refused to part with them. As he was unable to \nshow any documents of ownership, a court ruled in favor of Peter\'s \nheirs. Then the bishop went to Peter\'s tomb, touched the body, and \ncommanded it to rise and follow him to the court. The corpse then \n"confirmed the statement of the bishop in every particular, and \nfearful as they sat the judges reversed their former decision." 22 The wily \nsaint kept the estates, doubtless contributing a share to whatever \naccomplice it was who impersonated the dead Peter. \n\nSuch miracles were more common than might be expected. The \nsame thing happened in the time of St. Augustine the Apostle of \nEngland, according to his biographer John Brompton. "St. Augustine \nhad long been endeavoring to persuade a certain nobleman of great \nwealth to pay the appointed tithes, but out of obstinacy these were \nconstantly refused, which did great mischief and caused others to \nbecome discontented and impudently follow so bad an example." One \nday during High Mass, St. Augustine directed all who were excom- \nmunicate to leave the church. A tomb in the crypt suddenly opened, \nand a corpse came forth, explaining that it had been excommunicated \nby a priest now dead. St. Augustine led witnesses to the dead priest\'s \ntomb, and asked why the revenant had been excommunicated. The \npriestly ghost replied, in "a low, far-off" voice, "I excommunicated him \nfor his misdeeds, and particularly because he robbed the church of \nher due, refusing to pay his tithes." 25 Through this elaborate charade, \nthe saint was able to improve economic piety in the district. \n\nThe multitudes of phony or commercial saints are treated by \nmodern Catholic scholars with a rather amused tolerance, as if the \nsaint-makers\' fantasies held something of the same charm as tales \ninvented by bright children. It is rarely admitted that these fantasies \nwere not intended to charm but rather to defraud. The saints were \nmade up to earn money for the church, and many of the made-up \nsaints are still doing so, for the church refrains from publicizing their \nspurious origins lest such publicity might disappoint the faithful \nwhich, translated, means the donations might cease. \n\n1.

The "feminine" qualities of red- \nness, roundness, and fruition made the cherry everywhere sacred to the \nGoddess, along with other red fruits like the apple and pomegranate. \n\n\n\nSalacia \n\n"Salacious" Sea-goddess, Venus-Aphrodite worshipped in Rome as \nthe feminine abyss "with fish-teeming womb." \' The name probably \nwas related to Greek Thalassa, "Sea," which also gave rise to the holy \ncry Takssio raised by wedding guests in honor of the Goddess of \n\n\n\n884 \n\n\n\nMarriage, or maritare. Romans didn\'t know the origin of this wedding Salem \n\ncry but continued to use it nevertheless. 2 See Fish. Salome \n\n1. Neumann, A.P., 6. 2. Rose, 192. \n\n\n\nSalem \n\nSemitic "Peace," with variations like Shalem, Shalom, Selim, Solo- \nmon, Shalman, Salmon, Shalmaneser. Jeru-salem was "the House of \nPeace," or of the god Salem, whose earlier city was ruled by \nMelchizedek (Genesis 14), the "King of Light" called Melek or \nMolech in Phoenicia. "Peace" was the word spoken daily to the \ndying sun, and also to the dying sacrificial victim who impersonated him \nin the rites that "brought forth bread and wine" (Genesis 14:18). See \nLucifer. \n\n\n\nSaliva \n\nBoth Mohammed and Jesus claimed to restore sight to the blind by \napplying saliva to their eyes (Mark 8:23). This was an imitation of cures \npreviously attributed to priestesses of the Goddess. A clay tablet from \nNineveh says eye diseases could be cured by the mixed saliva and milk \nof a temple harlot. Romans thought blindness could be cured by the \nsaliva of a mother of sons. As late as the 19th century, Italian folk \nhealers were still trying to cure blindness with the saliva and milk of \nthe mother of a premature child. 1 \n\nNotions of the wonderful curative power of female saliva may be \ntraced back to Tantrism and its Chinese offshoot, Tao, whose \nscriptures called women\'s saliva "a great medicine," one of the three \nwonderful yin juices, the others being breast milk and menstrual \nblood. 2 \n\nEuropean pagan heroes also cured blindness with saliva so many \nof them that medieval churchmen had to say this was one of the \nrecognition signs for Antichrist. 3 \n\n1.

Gifford, 120. \n\n\n\nSalome \n\nThe Bible presents the Dance of the Seven Veils as a mere vulgar \nstriptease performed by Salome to "please Herod" (Matthew 14:6-8). \nActually, the Dance of the Seven Veils was an integral part of the \nsacred drama, depicting the death of the surrogate-king, his descent into \nthe underworld, and his retrieval by the Goddess, who removed one \nof her seven garments at each of the seven underworld gates. The \npriestess called Salome or "Peace" (Shalom) impersonated the de- \nscending Goddess, passing through seven gates in the temple of \nJeru-salem which meant House of Peace. "Josephus records that the \n\n\n\n885 \n\n\n\nSalt \n\n\n\nfirst name of the city was Solyma. Salma, or Salim, was evidently the \nSemite god of the rising or renewed sun; Salmaone was the Aegean \ngoddess from whom he took his titles, as did Salmoneus the Aeolian." \' \n\nSalome represented Ishtar as the third of her three high priestesses \nor "Marys." Her name was a translation of the Greek Irene, \n"Peace," the third of the sacred harlots called Horae. 2 She may have \nbeen identical with the sacred harlot Mary Magdalene, or Mary of \nthe Temple, whose so-called "seven devils" were the same underworld \ngatekeepers to whom the temple dancer gave her veils. These veils, \nlike the rainbow veils of Maya, signified the layers of earthly appear- \nances or illusions falling away from those who approach the central \nMystery of the deeps. Isis too had seven stoles with the same mystical \nsignificance. 3 \n\nThe dancing priestess was more than a trivial entertainer. Salome\'s \nhusband Joseph was killed after he lay with the queen, Mariamne or \nMiriam (Mary). 4 Salome was present with the virgin Mary the same \nMary? at the birth of Jesus; some said she was the midwife who \ndelivered the holy child. 5 Salome was present with all three Marys at the \ndeath of Jesus (Mark 15:40). Obviously she was also involved in the \ndeath of John the Baptist, which seems to have been not a murder but a \nritual sacrifice. \n\nSome early Christian sects (the Mandaeans) ignored Jesus, and \nworshipped John the Baptist as the true sacrificed Christ. 6 An early \nGreek epiphany hymn said it was the blood of John the Baptist that \n"bedewed" i.e., fructified the mothers and children of Jerusa- \nlem. 7 As an initiated Essenic prophet, John would have been sacer and \n"chosen" to die as a surrogate for the king, whose blood was required \nfor fertility of the land. John was beheaded, a common form of sacrificial \ndeath throughout the early Aegean and Levantine cultures, still \npracticed to this day in some of the eastern temples of the Goddess, \nthough the victims are now animals instead of men. 8 \n\nThough only a fragment in its present form, the story of Salome \npresents evidence for the survival of the Tammuz-Ishtar cult in \nJerusalem, where someone periodically died in the role of the god, and \nthe women raised the ancient lament for the victim in the temple \n(Ezekiel 8:14). \n\n1.

M., 1 52. \n\n\n\nSalt \n\nOne of the few substances known to the ancients that could preserve \nfoodstuffs and dead bodies was salt. Egyptian mummies were preserved \nin a brine solution called natron, "birth-fluid." Salt was accepted as a \nsubstitute for the Mother\'s regenerative blood; it came from the sea- \nwomb and had the savor of blood. Therefore salt became a symbolic \n\n\n\n886 \n\n\n\ninstrument of kinship, like maternal blood. The Roman rite of con far- alt \n\nreatio (patrician marriage) had the bride and groom share a cake of \n\nflour and salt, which stood for flesh and blood respectively, and \n\nmagically transformed them like those who in older times shared \nreal flesh and blood into blood kin, unable to harm one another. 1 \n\nThe Arabs signified a similar bond of good faith by sharing a meal \nof bread and salt, which created the binding portion of any covenant. \nThe Bible speaks of a "covenant of salt" (Numbers 18:19) as one that \ncannot be broken, even when it is a covenant between man and God. \nSalt was an acceptable substitute for blood also in dedicating an altar, \neither Jewish or Christian (see Blessing). \n\nA common Semitic metaphor for enlightened seers was "salt of the \nearth," i.e., true blood of the Earth Mother. The term was applied to \nChrist\'s followers (Matthew 5:31) to suggest that they could prophesy \ntruly. \n\nChristian uses of salt were copied largely from Roman pagans, who \nused salt to bless every public sacrifice. "Immolate" came from mola, \nthe flesh-and-blood-symbolic combination of salt and flour prepared by \nthe Vestal Virgins to sprinkle over every beast that was led to \nsacrifice. 2 \n\nChurch bells were solemnly anointed with salt and water, wiped \nwith linen, blessed, and christened. God was requested to give the \nbells power to dispel demons by their sound, and to send thunder and \nlightning far away from the vicinity of the church though bell- \nringing was never very successful in the latter endeavor, since church \nbell-towers were struck by lightning more often than any other \nstructure. 5 \n\nChristian infant baptism often involved rubbing the infant with salt \nto repel demons. It was said that heretics carefully rubbed the salt off. 4 \n\nSuperstitious fear of spilling salt was directly related to the idea of \nspilling blood. Throwing a pinch of salt over the shoulder to take off \nthe curse was a symbolic way of putting bloodshed "behind," or turning \none\'s back on it. \n\nNatural salt pillars in the vicinity of the Dead Sea proved profitable \nto enterprising medieval Saracens, who learned that Christians would \npay good money to be guided to the exact spot where "Lot\'s wife" \nstood, to behold a biblical miracle with their own eyes. Eroded by \nwind, the salt pillars often assumed fantastic shapes. One may well have \nbeen shaped like a woman; if not, a few touches of the chisel could \nmake it so. \n\nCabalistic tradition suggests that the biblical Lot\'s wife was really a \nform of the Triple Goddess. Hebrew MLH, "salt," is a sacred word \nbecause its numerical value is that of God\'s name of power, YH WH, \nmultiplied three times. 5 The same word is also a root of Malkuth, the \ncabalistic Queen Mother Earth. \n\n1.

Medieval Gnostics were accused \nof worshipping his as Sammael or Satanael. \n\nIn Britain he had a feminine counterpart, Samothea (Death- \nGoddess), queen of the mysterious land of the Hyperboreans, where \nPythagoras traveled to learn the arts of letters, astronomy, and science \nfrom this all-wise lady. 3 She seems to have been another form of \nSkadi or Scatha. \n\n1.

Samson\'s "mill" was the same as Omphale\'s wheel, to which \nHeracles was bound. His loss of hair meant the cutting of the sun god\'s \nrays, in the season when he became weak. \n\nAs Heracles was controlled by Omphale, and Ra was "made weak" \nby Isis, so Samson was deprived of his strength in due season by \nDelilah, "She Who Makes Weak." Another interpretation of her name \nwas Lily of the Yoni, that is, the female principle that deprived the \nphallic god of strength by drawing his "rays" or energy into herself. \nHair-cutting was a common mythic symbol of castration, since phallic \npower was supposed to reside in a man\'s hair, according to ancient \neastern beliefs. 1 The castrating priestess Delilah was a Semitic copy of \nHeracles\'s deadly consort Deianira, the instrument of his destruction. \nBlinding, also, meant putting out the "phallic eye." \n\nTalmudic tradition viewed Samson\'s "grinding" in Philistia as a \nsymbol of fornication suggesting a sacred-king cult in which a \nstrongman assumed the role of the sun hero, deflowered all the virgins \nuntil his strength was gone, then faced castration and sacrifice. 2 It has \n\n\n\n888 \n\n\n\nbeen supposed that Samson\'s wrecking of the Philistine temple stood for Sanguis ac Genus \n\nithe sun\'s power to dry out and crumble a structure made of mud Sapientia \n\ncricks. ^^^^^t^^^mi^^m \n\n1.

In \nfact Sapientia was sometimes represented as "the Siren of the Philoso- \nphers," pouring the red-and-white wines of enlightenment from her \nbreasts, rising from the sea like a crowned Aphrodite. 1 \n\nRenaissance mystics depicted Sapientia as the Shakti of God, \nidentifying her sometimes with the virgin Mary, sometimes with \nMother Nature, sometimes with God\'s "inner mind" or Goddess- \nWithin (I-dea). She was described as God\'s wisdom; indeed, as "all \nthe wisdom he had." 2 Spenser said Sapientia dwelt in God\'s bosom, as \nhis spouse, "the sovereign darling of the Deity, clad like a Queen in \nroyal robes." She was described as "the basic and primordial foundation \nof all things ... the being, life, and light of intelligible things," and a \nTriple Goddess: Sapientia creans, the Creatress; Sapientia disponans, \n"who unites all things in harmony"; and Sapientia gubernans, "other- \nwise known as Divine Providence." 5 \n\nThe Christian writer pseudo-Dionysius credited Sapientia with \ncreation itself, calling her "Thou unbegun and everlasting Wisdom, \nthe which in thyself art the sovereign-substantial Firsthood, the sover- \neign Goddess, and the sovereign Good." 4 \n\n\n\n889 \n\n\n\nSapphire Sapientia was the hidden Creatress of medieval thought the \n\nSara-Kali unofficial Goddess supposedly eliminated from Europe\'s religions \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ centuries earlier, but still living fragmented under various names: Mary, \nNature, Luna, Earth, Venus, or Sophia. \n\nI. de Givry, 361. 2. von Franz, 16. 3.

Persian forms \nreferred to a matriarchal government, evolving into "temple of wom- \nen," seraglio, or harem. 1 \n\nSarah was the maternal goddess of the "Abraham" tribe that \nformed an alliance with Egypt in the 3rd millenium b.c. 2 This was \nthe real meaning of the embarrassing biblical story about Abraham\'s \npimping for his wife (Genesis 12). According to Jewish tradition, \nSarah ranked higher than her husband, and her death brought "confu- \nsion" to a nation that was in good order while she lived. 3 She was \ninterred in the holy cave of Machpelah, a womb-necropolis of the \nGoddess of the Anakim. Votive idols in this cave were later adopted \nby the Jews and called by the names of deified ancestors: Sarah, \nAbraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob. 4 \n\n1. Briffault 3, 1 10. 2. Graves, W.

Some gypsies appeared in 10th-century \nPersia as tribes of itinerant dervishes calling themselves Kalenderees, \n\n\n\n890 \n\n\n\n"people of the Goddess Kali." ! A common gypsy clan name is still Sara-Kali \n\nKaldera or Calderash, descended from past Kali-worshippers, like the \n\nKele-De of Ireland. 2 ^^^^^^^^ \n\nEuropean gypsies relocated their Goddess in the ancient "Druid \nGrotto" underneath Chartres Cathedral, once the interior of a sacred \nmount known as the Womb of Gaul, when the area was occupied by \nthe Carnutes, "Children of the Goddess Car." Carnac, Kermarjo, \nKerlescan, Kercado, Carmona in Spain, and Chartres itself were named \nafter this Goddesss, probably a Celtic version of Kore or Q\'re, \ntraceable through eastern nations to Kauri, another name for Kali. 3 \n\nThe Druid Grotto used to be occupied by the image of a black \nGoddess giving birth, similar to certain images of Kali. 4 Christians \nadopted this ancient idol and called her Virgo Paritura, "Virgin Giving \nBirth." Gypsies called her Sara-Kali, "the mother, the woman, the \nsister, the queen, the Phuri Dai, the source of all Romany blood." They \nsaid the black Virgin wore the dress of a gypsy dancer, and every \ngypsy should make a pilgrimage to her grotto at least once in his life. \nThe grotto was described as "your mother\'s womb." A gypsy pilgrim \nwas told: "Shut your eyes in front of Sara the Kali, and you will know \nthe source of the spring of life which flows over the gypsy race." 5 \n\nA gypsy prayer to the Goddess demonstrates her Kali-like trinity of \nCreator, Preserver, and Destroyer: \n\nThou destroyest and dost make everything on earth; thou canst see \nnothing old, for death lives in thee, thou givest birth to all upon the \nearth for thou thyself art life. . . . Thou art the mother of every living \ncreature and the distributor of good; thou doest according to thy \nwisdom in destroying what is useless or what has lived its destined time; by \nthy wisdom thou makest the earth to regenerate all that is new. . . . \n[TJhou are the benefactress of mankind. 6 \n\nSara-Kali was also known as Bibi, "the Aunt," a Destroyer- \nCrone corresponding to Russia\'s Baba Yaga. Like the Kalika who \ncreated fatal illnesses, Bibi "has the power to cause all kinds of \ndisease, especially at the beginning of a new month when there is a full \nmoon." 7 Bibi dressed in red, recalling the red-clothed Kali at the final \ndissolution of the world when her garment is made of "a red mass of \nblood" from all the gods she devours. 8 As Kali\'s dakinis identified \nthemselves with the Destroyer at ceremonies of death, so gypsy women \nwore red for funerals. 9 \n\nGypsies also used the Indo-Egyptian Yoni Yantra (triangle) as a \nsign for "woman," practiced Tantric sexual rites like those of the east, \nand believed in reincarnation according to Hindu doctrines of karma \ngoverned by the Goddess. The gypsy said, "The sands of truth will \ndeposit me on the bed of earth from which I came. . . . [Njaked, I shall \nreturn to the womb of my mother." 10 \n\nSome gypsies insisted that Sara-Kali was Queen of Heaven and \nEarth. According to a secret tradition, all the cathedrals in France \nwere arranged to form an earthly reflection of the constellation Virgo, \n\n\n\n891 \n\n\n\nSarama Sara-Kali\'s true home in heaven. 1 \' After being semi-Christianized, \n\nSaranyu gypsies identified Sara-Kali with the virgin Mary. Gypsies celebrated th \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin by piling up the heads \nof sacrificed fowls in front of her church, as Kali\'s votaries in India piled \nup the heads of sacrificed animals. 12 \n\nFurther Christianization inspired legends to provide Sara-Kali witl \na Christian background. Some claimed she was not a mother goddess \nbut a saint, the patron saint of the gypsy people. She accompanied the \nthree Marys from the foot of Jesus\'s cross on their sea voyage to the \nwest. They landed at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. Another story said \nSara-Kali was a gypsy queen from the Rhone delta, who swam from \nSaintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to meet the boat carrying Mary Salome, \nJoseph of Arimathea, Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus, \nand other Christian celebrities, whose bones were displayed at the site \nthroughout the Middle Ages. 15 \n\nI.Keightley,20. 2.Esty,67. 3.

Like other Huntress-figures she symbolized the death- \ndealing function of the Goddess who implacably hunted down all whos \ntime of dissolution had come, according to the cycles of karma. \n\n1.0Tlaherty,352. \n\n\n\nSaranyu \n\nThe Vedic Goddess as a mare, mother of the Asvins or centaurs. Her \nwestern counterparts were Leukippe, Melanippe, Epona, or Mare- \nheaded Demeter. (See Horse.) Saranyu also gave birth to Yama and \nYami, the Lord of Death and Lady of Life, when she occupied the \nform of a woman instead of a mare. According to one story, Saranyu \ncreated a shadow-woman exactly like herself, and left this simulacrum \nwith her husband while she departed in the form of a mare. When \nher husband Vivasvat realized the deception, he turned himself into a \nstallion and followed her, as Poseidon became a stallion in order to \nmate with Mare-headed Demeter. However, Saranyu\'s mating took \nplace in a peculiar way. Vivasvat spilled his semen on the ground, \nand Saranyu snuffed some of it into her nostrils. In this way she became \npregnant, and later gave birth to the physician-gods, the Asvins, from \n\n\n\n892 \n\n\n\niher mouth. 1 The myth evidently came from an early period when the Sarapis \n\n(mechanism of impregnation was thought to be variable and the \n\norifice of birth not always exclusively genital. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nl.O\'Flaherty.61,69. \n\n\n\nSarapiS V ar. Serapis \n\ni Syncretic god worshipped as a supreme divinity in Egypt to the end \nof the 4th century a.d. The highly popular cult of Sarapis used many \ntrappings that were later adopted by Christians: chants, lights, bells, \nvestments, processions, music. \n\nSarapis represented a final transformation of the savior Osiris into a \nmonotheistic figure, virtually identical with the Christian God. The \n(religion of Sarapis was founded in the 3rd century B.C. by Ptolemy Soter \n((Ptolemy the Savior), the Macedonian pharaoh who identified him- \njself with the deity in traditional pharaonic style. 1 This Ptolemaic god \n(was a combination of Osiris and Apis, called Osarapis, or Sarapis. As \nChrist was a sacrificial lamb, so Sarapis was a sacrificial bull as well as a \ngod in human form. He was annually sacrificed in atonement for the \n[sins of Egypt, with the words: "If any evil be about to befall either those \nwho now sacrifice, or Egypt in general, may it be averted on this \nhead." 2 \n\nIn his later development, Sarapis picked up the qualities of every \nEgyptian deity and became both Father and Son, ruler and victim. \nHe was called lord of Death, Good Shepherd, creator, healer, sun, \nfertility god, impregnator of the Goddess his image carried in holy \nprocessions was a huge phallus. His greatest temple, the Sarapeum at \nAlexandria, was a cathedral of pilgrimage and medicine. The philoso- \npher Demetrius of Phalerum testified that Sarapis had cured him of \nblindness; his paeans to the god were still sung as hymns centuries \nlater. 3 Alexandrian psalms declared: "There is only one Zeus Sarapis." 4 \n\nSarapis became a great patron of arts and letters. The Sarapeum \nincluded a vast library of literary treasures from all over the Roman \nempire, a storehouse of contemporary learning. When Christianity \ncame to power in Alexandria, the library was attacked, though it was \ndesperately defended for three years. 5 Finally, in 389 a.d., Theodosius \ngave a direct order that the building must be wrecked and the books \nburned. Christians therefore destroyed the Sarapeum and its library, \nthus eliminating most of the ancient world\'s important literature in \none holocaust. 6 \n\nThe "deceased" pagan god was later assimilated into the canon as \nan artificial saint or saints. Among several Egyptian St. Sarapions, the \nmost notable was called a companion of St. Anthony, but a legend of his \nmartyrdom was constructed from the destruction of Sarapis\'s temple. \nThe late official canonization of St. Sarapion at the end of the 19th \n\n\n\n893 \n\n\n\nSarasvati century was based on an ecclesiastical literary hoax, the "discovery" \n\nSatan of some texts alleged to be copies of material in the lost Sarapean \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ library. 7 \n\nl.Cumont,A.R.G.R.,74. 2.

She was said to have invented all \nthe arts of civilization: music, letters, mathematics, calendars, magic, the \nVedas, and all other branches of learning. Sometimes she bore the \nname of Savitri, listed by some scholars as a male god, even though \nancient records called Savitri "wife of Brahma" and "Daughter of the \nSun." 1 Frequently she was identified with the holy waters of Ganges. \n\n1.

Early Egyptians called \nhim the Great Serpent Sata, Son of the Earth, immortal because he was \nregenerated every day in the Goddess\'s womb. A man could become \' \nimmortal, like Sata, by repeating prayers to identify himself with the \ngod: "I am the serpent Sata, whose years are infinite. I lie down dead. I \nI am born daily. I am the serpent Sata, the dweller in the uttermost parts \nof the earth. I lie down in death. I am born. I become new, I renew \nmy youth every day." 1 \n\nSata seems to have been an underground aspect of the sun, Horus-s \nRa, corresponding to Apollo\'s underground serpent-form Python, \nwhom the Jews called Apollyon, Spirit of the Pit. He was a phallic \n\n\n\n894 \n\n\n\nconsort of the archaic Goddess Sati, or Setet, whose name was the Satan \n\nsame as that of a virgin aspect of Kali, and who once ruled Upper Egypt \n\nwhich was known as the Land of Sati. 2 The god was also called Set ^^^^^i \n\nthe biblical Seth, who may not have been immortal but did manage to \n\nlive 912 years (Genesis 5:8). \n\nThe snake\'s communion with the life-giving fountains of the deep \nwas still an important image in dynastic times, when Sata became the \nkeheret-snake, living in a yonic orifice in Isis\'s temple and giving oracles, \nlike Python at Delphi. It was felt that disasters would strike the \ncountry if the serpent should leave the Goddess\'s sacred hole. 5 \n\nThe serpent was often a symbol of the sun god\'s alter ego, the \nBlack Sun, spirit of night or of death. He combined with the solar disc \nas the god during his dark hours. The pattern was the same in Osiris- \nSet, Apollo-Python, Anu-Aciel, Baal-Yamm, etc. The dark god was \nthe light god\'s adversary not because he was originally viewed as evil, \nbut because he represented a sleeping or quiescent phase of the same \ngod. \n\nSata dwelling forever in the underworld reappeared in Russian folk \ntales as the great underground serpent Koshchei the Deathless. 4 In \nhis "adversary" role he eventually became the immortal Dragon whom \nthe sun-hero had to slay, as men wished to slay the spirit of death \ndwelling within their own bodies, the archetypal "betrayer" who led \nthem sooner or later to destruction. \n\nTo the Hebrews, a "satan" was an adversary in the sense of a \njudge: one who tested the faith of another by asking trick questions or \nposing problems to be solved. The "satan" first appears in the Bible as \none of the sons of God, advising God to test the faith of Job (Job 1:6). \nIn the original wording, Satan was one of the bene ha-elohim, sons of \n"the gods"; but Bible translators always singularized the plurals to \nconceal the fact that the biblical Jews worshipped a pantheon of \nmultiple gods. 5 \n\nThis "son of God" was identified with the lightning-serpent \nLucifer by the words of Jesus, who claimed to have seen Satan \ndescending into the earth as lightning (Luke 10:18). This repeated \nPersian myths concerning Ahriman, the lightning-serpent cast from \nheaven to the underworld by the god of light. Persians held that God \nand the Great Serpent were twin brothers, an idea that entered into \nGnostic tradition and led to medieval magic books that called upon \nSatan by the mystic names of God, such as Messias, Soter, Emman- \nuel, Saboth, Adonai (Messiah, Savior, Immanuel, Lord of Hosts, the \nLord). 6 \n\nSatan not only answered to God\'s names, he even assumed a \ndivine appearance when he wished. The medieval church insisted \nthat Satan "transfigures himself into an angel of light," so anyone \nclaiming an unofficial angelic vision could be charged with devil \nworship at the discretion of inquisitors who, naturally, always knew the \ndifference between a real angel and a devil in angelic disguise. 7 \n\n\n\n895 \n\n\n\nSati Islamic writers called Satan Shaytan, or Iblis. He governed the race \n\noidjinn, the "genies" who were once ancestral spirits, like the \n\n_^^^^^^^^ Roman genius. The djinn scorned Allah\'s prophets, so an army of \n\nangels attacked them, killed many, and took the rest prisoner. Among \nthe prisoners was Iblis-Shaytan, also called Azazel, to whom the Jews \nused to offer scapegoats on the Day of Atonement. Iblis-Shaytan had \nrebelled against Allah when Allah created Adam and ordered all the \nangels to worship his creation. Allah says in the Koran, "We said \nunto the Angels, Worship ye Adam, and they worshipped except Iblis \nwho was of the Jinn." 8 \n\nThe background of this story may have come from the early \nGnostic Gospel of Philip, which the church censored for obvious \nreasons: "Human beings make gods, and worship their creation. It \nwould be appropriate for the gods to worship human beings! " 9 \nSatan\'s worst offense seemed to be that he was not disposed to respect \nman, whose faults he well knew; nor did he have any good to say of \nGod, who had governed heaven too harshly and stimulated rebellion. \nMedieval Christians interpreted everything apart from their own \northodoxy as a manifestation of Satan-worship: astrology, magic, \npagan ceremonies, divination, etc. \n\nService of Satan is everything dealing with paganism, not only the \nsacrifices and the worship of idols and all the ceremonies involved in \ntheir service, according to the ancient custom, but also the things that have \ntheir beginning in it. Service of Satan is clearly that a person should \nfollow astrology and watch the positions and motions of the sun, the \nmoon, and the stars for the purpose of traveling, going forth, or \nundertaking a given work, while believing that he is benefited or harmed \nby their motion or their course; and that one should believe the men \nwho, after watching the motions of the stars, prognosticate by them. w \n\n1 .

Saturn was the same as the Black Sun \n\n(Aciel) of Chaldean astrologers, the Lord ofDeathjit the nad ir of th e \n\nunderworld, representing the sun at his lowest aspect in the midwin- \n\nter solstice. Sometimes he was called Sun of Night. \n\nAt Harran, near old Edessa in what is now Turkey, Saturn\'s \nworship included the wearing of black clothing, and burning candles \nmade of incense, opium, goat\'s fat, and urine, with the prayer: "Lord, \nwhose name is august, whose power is widespread, whose spirit is \nsublime, O Lord Saturn the cold, the dry, the dark, the harmful . . . \ncrafty sire who knowest all wiles, who art deceitful, sage, understand- \ning, who causest prosperity or ruin, happy or unhappy is he whom thou \nmakest such." \' \n\nAs a rule the Lord of Death was both a god and a demon, like \nShiva the Destroyer. He was the negative side of the summer sun, \npropitiatedJajnidwinleiiso he might allow spring tocomejgain. This \nimportant festival became the Roman Saturnalia, which contributed \nmany of its customs to Christmas. At Saturn\'s festival, death and \natonement were featured as well as joyous celebration of the sun\'s \nnew birth. \n\nA sacrificial victim was chosen to represent both the god himself \nand the king-surrogate. He was slain and sent to the underworld to \nmerge with his divine counterpart. "It was the universal practice in \nancient Italy, wherever the worship of Saturn prevailed, to choose a \nman who played the part and enjoyed all the traditionary privileges of \nSaturn for a season, and then died, whether by his own or another\'s \nhand, whether by the knife or the fire or on the gallows-tree, in the \ncharacter of the good god who gave his life for the world." 2 \n\nThough the real killing of the victim was gradually replaced by \nsymbolic killing, the festival was never abandoned, and in Christian \ntimes it became part of the midwinter Carnival. "The mock execution \nof King Carnival is a vestige of the ancient Saturnalia, when the man \nwho had acted as king of the revels was actually put to death at the end \nof his reign. This practice continued in parts of the Roman army well \ninto Christian times." 3 \n\nSaturn gave his name to Saturday, the sabbath of the week\'s end, \nbefore the coming of the new sun on Sun-day (Latin dies soli\'s). To \nthe Jews this was the seventh day when God "rested," like Saturn \nquiescent in darkness before the sun rose again. Saturn was identified \nwith the seventh planetary sphere, whose astrological influences partook \nof "saturnine" qualities such as somberness, heaviness, darkness, \npassivity, coldness, etc. \n\nThe Babylonian name of the planet Saturn was Ninip, which was \nalso a name of the underworld god: "the black Saturn, the ghost of \nthe dead sun, the demoniac elder god." 4 But Saturn was not altogether \n\n\n\n897 \n\n\n\nSavior demoniac. Like most chthonian deities, he was ambiguous. He was \n\noften revered as a healer. Our medicinal symbol Rx began as the \n\nplanetary sigil of Saturn, which was often written on paper and eaten \n\nas a cure for disease. 5 \n\nl.Cumont,A.R.G.R.,28,90. 2. Frazer, G.B., 679. 3.

Its literal meaning \nwas "one who sows the seed," i.e., a phallic god, like Rome\'s Semo \nSancus Holy Seed consort of Mother Earth. 1 After sowing or plant- \ning, the Soter was "born again" in the new grain as a Divine Child, \nand his advent was hailed with the formula, "He is risen." 2 \n\nIt was usual for the Savior to sow his "seed" three times, like the \nPersian Messiah who spilled his seed three times into the womb of \nMother Earth (Hvov). 3 At Eleusis the savior Iasion bore the title of \nTriptolemus, "Three Plowings," ostensibly because he lay with \nMother Demeter "in a thrice-plowed field"; but the field was Demeter \nherself, as Mother Earth, and the Savior was the plow. 4 Ptolemy, the \nroyal name of the Macedonian line of Egyptian pharaohs, meant \n"plower" or "sower," like the Greek Soter. 5 \n\nSince most kings were gods made flesh, many bore the title of \nSavior. Antiochus Soter (Antiochus the Savior) ruled Babylon from \n280 to 260 b.c, and was identified with the sacrificial god Nabu, \n"exalted Son, powerful leader of the gods." 6 In 48 B.C., Julius Caesar \nwas hailed as "God made manifest and universal Savior of human life." \nHis successor Augustus was "Ancestral God and Savior of the whole \nhuman race." 7 The emperor Nero was immortalized on his coins as \n"Savior of Mankind." 8 Roman emperors were routinely deified and \nmade "saviors," as shown by the address prepared for the birthday \ncelebration of Augustus in 9 b.c. \n\nThis day has given earth an entirely new aspect. The world would have \ngone to destruction had not there streamed forth from him who is now \nborn a common blessing. Rightly does he judge who recognized in this \nbirthday the beginning of life and of all the powers of life. . . . The \nprovidence which rules over all has filled this man with such gifts for the \nsalvation of the world as designate him the Savior for us for the coming \ngeneration: of wars he will make an end, and establish all things worthily. \nBy his appearing are the hopes of our forefathers fulfilled: not only has \nhe surpassed the good deeds of men of earlier times, but it is impossible \nthat one greater than he can ever appear. The birthday of God has \nbrought to the world glad tidings that are bound up in him. From this \nbirthday a new era begins. 9 \n\n\n\nSuch speeches were often copied by followers of less exalted \n\n\n\n898 \n\n\n\n"saviors," of which the early Christian era had many, especially in the \nMiddle East. "Palestine was seething with eschatological (i.e., salva- \ntional) movements. . . . [T]he emergence of the Christian sect was \nanything but an isolated incident." One of the greatest problems of \nearly Christianity was to decide what the savior was supposed to be \nsaving humanity from. Among the many theories put forth were: \nChrist saved mankind from (1) death, or (2) sin, or (3) demons, or (4) \nthe fleshly world and its evil demiurge. 10 \n\nCelsus quoted a typical speech of the kind of self-styled savior \ncurrently prevalent in his day: \n\nlam God (or a son of God, or a divine Spirit). And I have come. Already \nthe world is being destroyed. And you, O men, are to perish because of \nyour iniquities. But I wish to save you. And you see me returning again \nwith heavenly power. Blessed is he who has worshipped me now! But I \nwill cast everlasting fire upon all the rest, both on cities and on country \nplaces. And men who fail to realize the penalties in store for them will \nin vain repent and groan. But I will preserve for ever those who have been \nconvinced by me. " \n\nGnostics believed in a Buddhistic succession of saviors. Some \nGnostic leaders said "the savior does not come just once into the world \nbut that from the beginning of time he wanders in different forms \nthrough history." n The belief of Jewish Essenes in a savior of this type \nprobably contributed to the medieval legend of the Wandering Jew. \n\n1.

O\'Flaherty, 49-50; Lurousse, 344. \n\n\n\nScold \n\nProbably derived from Skuld (Skadi), the Norse Goddess of cursing, \nthird of the Norns, who spoke the deadly words that condemned every \n\n\n\n899 \n\n\n\nScorpion man to death sooner or later. Even after Christianity discredited \n\nSkuld, men continued to believe that women\'s curses had effective \n\n^^^^^^^^^ power to injure them, to cause bad luck, disease, or death. \n\nCertainly Christian laws displayed fear of women\'s maledictions. \nMen were permitted to curse women, but a woman could be jailed or \ntortured for "scolding" a man. In England, "a common scold" was \nconsidered a criminal, like a thief. The ducking stool, frequently used \nto drown witches, was also used to punish a scold. 1 \n\nIn 1632 the English brought from Scotland an instrument of \ntorture called a brank, or "scold\'s bridle": an iron head-cage with a \ntongue piece to be inserted in the mouth, the cage being locked around \nthe head. Sometimes the tongue piece was shaped like a spoon; \nsometimes it was a sharp spike. A brank with four sharp spikes, two to \npierce the tongue and two to pierce the cheeks, was used to fasten the \n"witch" Agnes Sampson to the wall of her cell, as part of the torment to \nmake her confess to the crime of witchcraft. 2 \n\nThe brank was still in use as a punishment for "scolding" women \nup to the middle of the 19th century. In 1856 a woman locked into \none of these devices was paraded from the town cross to the church at \nBolton-le-Moors, in Lancashire. 3 \n\n1. Hazlitt, 158. 2. Robbing, 359. 3.

Scorpio was the same in Babylonia, India, and Greece; and \nthe Maya of Yucatan also called the same constellation "scorpion \nstars." 1 \n\nAstrological myths everywhere placed Aquarius the Water-drawer \nat the winter solstice, Taurus the Bull at the spring equinox, Leo the \nLion at the summer solstice, and Scorpio at the autumnal equinox. 2 \nTherefore it was said in Egypt that the Scorpion killed Horus, the \nsun, sending him to his midwinter death and resurrection as his Mother \nIsis gave him rebirth; and Pharaoh\'s daughter apparently played the \npart of the Water-drawer or divine midwife on the banks of the Nile, as \nshown by the myth of Moses. \n\nSpirits of the four points of the year were sometimes called Sons of \nHorus, and placed as small images in the four corners of a pharaoh\'s \ntomb. As man, bull, lion, and scorpion (or serpent) they were adopted \nby Christianity and converted into the four totems of the evangelists \nand the four angels of the Apocalypse. \n\n1.

Budge, G.E. 1,341. ^^^^ mm ^^^^ amam \n\n\n\nSerpent \n\nIt was a general belief in the ancient world that snakes don\'t die of old \nage like other animals, but periodically shed their skins and emerge \nrenewed or reborn into another life. Greeks called the snake\'s cast \nskin geras, "old age." The Chinese envisioned resurrection of the dead \nas a man splitting his old skin and coming out of it as a youth again, \nlike a snake. Melanesians say "to slough one\'s skin" means eternal life. \nA basic serpent-myth said the dual Moon-goddess of life and death \nmade the first man. Her bright aspect suggested making him immortal \nlike a snake, able to shed his skin; but her dark aspect insisted that he \nshould die and be buried in the earth. 1 Eternal life and serpenthood are \nstill equated in the Italian expression averpiu annid\'un serpente \n"being older than a serpent." \n\nThe ageless serpent was originally identified with the Great \nGoddess herself. Hinduism\'s Ananta the Infinite was the serpent- \nmother who embraced Vishnu and other gods during their "dead" \nphase. 2 She was also Kundalini, the inner female soul of man in serpent \nshape, coiled in the pelvis, induced through proper practice of yoga to \nuncoil and mount through the spinal chakras toward the head, bringing \ninfinite wisdom. The Serpent-goddess occupied the famous Khmer \ntemple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia where she embraced the king every \nnight. If one night the Goddess did not appear, it was a sign that the \nking must be killed and a new king chosen. 3 \n\nThe Negritos said the divine people called Chinoi (Chinese) were \ndescended from a mighty Serpent-goddess named Mat Chinoi, \nMother of the Chinese. In her belly lived beautiful angels who received \nthe souls of the dead. Since her womb was Paradise, shamans \nunderwent their death-and-rebirth initiations by entering the serpent\'s \nbelly. 4 \n\nThe ancient Aegean world worshipped primarily women and \nserpents. Men didn\'t participate in religious ceremonies until late in \nthe Bronze Age, when Cretan kings were allowed to become priests of \nthe bull-god. Even then, the priest\'s role was subordinate to that of \nthe priestess, until the priest himself took the title of "serpent." 5 The \nword for "priest" among ancient Akkadian peoples literally meant \n"snake charmer." 6 \n\nThe Indian Serpent-goddess Kadru gave birth to all the Nagas or \ncobra people, and made them immortal by feeding them her divine \nlunar blood. 7 She had a Babylonian counterpart, the Goddess Kadi of \nDer, worshipped as a serpent with a woman\'s head and breasts. 8 Her \nchildren like the Nagas were depicted as water-serpents, human from \n\n\n\n903 \n\n\n\nSefpent \n\n\n\nBookofThoth \n\nLegendary Egyptian \nmagical text sup- \nposed to have been \nwritten by the god \nThoth, found in the ne- \ncropolis at Memphis \nby a young prince \nnamed Satni- \nKhamois. \n\nMagic Papyri Col- \nlections of exorcisms, \ninvocations, charms, \nand spells widely circu- \nlated during the early \nChristian era, used as \nbases for later gri- \nmoires and Hermetic \ntexts. \n\n\n\nMahabharata Indi- \nan epic poem, \nconsisting of histori- \ncal and legendary \nmaterial gathered be- \ntween the 4th and 10th \ncenturies a.d., in- \ncluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\nthe waist up, like mermaids and mermen. The Nagas guarded "great \ntreasures of wealth and precious stones, and sometimes books of secret \nteachings in underwater palaces." 9 \n\nA similar serpent guarded the wonderful Book of Thoth, which \nwas hidden in an underwater palace. 10 Like his Greek twin Hermes, \nThoth was often incarnate in a snake, signifying his magical wisdom. \nEgypt agreed with India in depicting the first serpent as a totemic \nform of the Great Mother herself. Egypt\'s archaic Mother of Creation \nwas a serpent, Per-Uatchet or Buto. The Egyptian uraeus-snake was \na hieroglyphic sign for "Goddess." " Incongruously, "Uraeus" later \nbecame one of the most popular "secret names of God" listed in \nMagic Papyri and medieval texts of sorcery. \n\nEgypt\'s Serpent-goddess also had the title of Mehen the Envel- \nopes similar to Kundalini or Ananta. Each night, Mehen enfolded \nthe ram-headed god Auf-Ra (Phallus of Ra) during his sojourn in the \nuterine underworld. This was a mythic image of the king\'s sexual \nunion with his Goddess, reminiscent of the custom of Angkor Wat. 12 At \nPhilae, the Serpent-goddess received the title of Anqet, from anq, to \nsurround, to embrace. 13 "Serpent of the Nile" was the title, not only of \nCleopatra, but of all Egyptian queens who represented the nation and \nthe Goddess embracing the king. \n\nThe birth-and-death Goddesses Isis and Nephthys became identi- \nfied with the dual Serpent-mother of life and after-life. Only they \ncould help the soul through the section of the underworld inhabited by \nserpent deities, Egypt\'s version of the Nagas. 14 The Mahabharata \ndepicts a hero seeking immortality in a similar underworld called "city of \nserpents," where the dual Mother of Life and Death wove the web of \nnights and days with black and white thread, binding them with the red \nthread of life. 15 \n\nThe Akkadian Goddess Ninhursag, "She Who Gives Life to the \nDead," was also called "Mistress of Serpents" as yet another form of \nKadru or Kadi. 16 Babylon\'s version of her made her a dark twin of the \nHeaven-goddess Ishtar, calling her Lamia or Lamashtu, "Great \nLady, Daughter of Heaven." Cylinder seals showed her squatting, Kali- \nlike, over her mate, the god Pazuzu, he of the serpent penis. 17 As \nanother Lord of Death, he gave himself up to be devoured by the \nGoddess. The image of the male snake deity enclosed or devoured by \nthe female gave rise to a superstitious notion about the sex life of snakes, \nreported by Pliny and solemnly believed in Europe even up to the \n20th century: that the male snake fertilizes the female snake by putting \nhis head in her mouth and letting her eat him. 18 \n\nThe male serpent deity became the phallic consort of the Great \nMother, sometimes a "father" of races, because he was the Mother\'s \noriginal mate. In some myths, he was no more than a living phallus she: \ncreated for her own sexual pleasure. In other myths, she allowed him \nto take part in the work of creation or to fertilize her world-producing \nwomb. When the serpent-creator turned arrogant and tried to pre- \n\n\n\n904 \n\n\n\ntend that he alone made the universe, the Goddess punished him, Serpent \n\nbruising his head with her heel and banishing him to the under- \nworld. 19 On this version of the creation myth the Jews based their ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nnotion of Eve\'s progeny bruising the serpent\'s head, and the rabbini- \ncal opinion that the serpent was Eve\'s first lover and the true father of \nCain. 20 \n\nActually, the serpent was worshipped in Palestine long before \nYahweh\'s cult arose. Early Hebrews adopted the serpent-god all their \ncontemporaries revered, and the Jewish priestly clan of Levites were \n"sons of the Great Serpent," i.e., of Leviathan, "the wriggly one." 21 \nHe was worshipped in combination with his Goddess, the moon. 22 The \nBible shows that Yahweh was a hostile rival of the serpent Leviathan, \nfor the two gods battled each other (Psalms 74:14; 89:10, Isaiah 5 1:9). \nThey would engage in another final battle at doomsday (Isaiah 27: 1 ; \nRevelation 12). \n\nAnother Jewish name for the Great Serpent was Nehushtan, \ndescribed as the god of Moses. Hebrew nahash, "serpent," descended \nfrom an ancient Vedic serpent-king, Nahusha, once "the supreme ruler \nof heaven," until he was cast down to the underworld by a rival. 23 \nNehushtan was the same god whose image Moses made: a "fiery \nserpent" according to Numbers 21:8. The Israelites worshipped him \nuntil the reign of Hezekiah, when the new priesthood "cut down the \ngroves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made" \n(2 Kings 18:4). \n\nYet serpent worship continued in Israel. Seraph, the Hebrew word \nfor the divine fiery serpent, used to mean an earth-fertilizing light- \nning-snake, and later became an angel. 24 The seraphim were originally \nserpent-spirits, like those of the caduceus created by Hermes the \nGreat Serpent and copied by Mosaic tradition. Jewish medallions of the \n1st and 2nd centuries B.C. represented Jehovah as a serpent god, like \nthe "snake-tailed winds" of the Greeks. 25 Jews of Asia Minor said their \nJehovah was the same as Zeus Sabazius the serpent god of Phrygia. 26 \nSome Jewish Gnostics early in the Christian era maintained that the \npost-exilic Jehovah was no god, but a devil, the usurper of the original \nKingdom of the Wise Serpent. 27 \n\nMuch Gnostic literature praised the serpent of Eden for bring- \ning the "light" of knowledge to humanity, against the will of a tyrannical \nGod who wanted to keep humans ignorant. 28 This view of the Eden \nmyth dated back to Sumero-Babylonian sources that said man was made \nby the Earth Mother out of mud and placed in the garden "to dress it \nand to keep it" (Genesis 2:1 5) for the gods, because the gods were too \nlazy to do their own farming and wanted slaves to plant, harvest, and \ngive them offerings. 29 The gods agreed that their slaves should never \nlearn the godlike secret of immortality, lest they get above themselves \nand be ruined for work. Therefore, as the Epic of Gilgamesh reports, \nthe gods gave death to humanity, and "Life they kept in their own \nhands." 50 \n\n\n\n905 \n\n\n\nSerpent \n\n\n\nHypostasis of the \nArchons ("Reality of \nthe Rulers") A \nGnostic Gospel written \nabout the 3rd centu- \nry A.D., incorporating \none of the alternate \nversions of the Adam \nand Eve myth. \n\n\n\nIn one of the interwoven Genesis stories, God was not one but \nmany, the elohim or "gods-and-goddesses." 31 The God of Eden \nremarked to his divine colleagues, "Behold, the man is become as one \nof us, to know good and evil"; therefore he must be ejected from the \ngarden at once, lest he "take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for \never" (Genesis 3:22). The serpent\'s teachings would have led man to \nconquer death and become godlike, against the will of the elohim. \n\nThe Hypostasis of the Archons showed that the serpent was a \ntotemic form of the Goddess, apparently taking pity on her doomed \ncreature and seeking to instruct him in the attainment of eternal life: \n"The Female Spiritual Principle came in the Snake, the Instructor, \nand it taught them, saying, \'y u sna H not die; for it was out of jealousy \nthat he said this to you. Rather, your eyes shall open, and you shall \nbecome like gods, recognizing evil and good.\' " Then "the arrogant \nRuler" (God) cursed the serpent and the woman. 52 Some Gnostic \nsects honored both Eve and the serpent for their efforts on behalf of \nhumanity. 33 \n\nThe present form of the biblical story is obviously a much-revised \nversion of the original tales of the Great Mother and her serpent. \nBabylonian icons showed the Goddess attended by her snake, offering \nman the food of immortality. The Pyramid Texts said it was the \nserpent who offered the food of eternal life. 34 As Ophion, or Ophi, he \nwas the ancestor of the African serpent god Obi, whose name is still \npreserved in the voodoo-magic system, oheah?^ The Bible uses a \nHebrew version of the name, obh, for the familiar spirit of the Witch \nof Endor, and the Vulgate renders this word "python." 36 In Dahomey, \nthe primal Mother-Creatress Mawu was supported by a Great \nSerpent. 37 \n\nGnostic accounts of the Eden myth used the Aramaic pun \nidentifying Eve, the Teacher, and the Serpent: Hawah, Mother of \nAll Living; hawa, to instruct; and hewya, Serpent. 38 Eve\'s name in \nArabic still combines the idea of "life" (hayyat) with the name of the \nserpent (Hayyat). 39 Hippolytus viewed the serpent as a feminine Logos, \n"the wise Word of Eve. This is the mystery of Eden: this is the river \nthat flows out of Eden. This is also the mark that was set on Cain, whose \nsacrifice the God of this world did not accept whereas he accepted \nthe bloody sacrifice of Abel: for the lord of this world delights in blood. \nThis Serpent is he who appeared in the latter days in human form at \nthe time of Herod." * \n\nArabian tradition identified the food of immortality with the female \nuterine blood, colored "royal purple"; and the Mother\'s uterine \ngarden with the moon temple at Marib in Sheba. Legend said the \nserpents of Sheba were purple with the divine essence, and lived in \ntrees; the people were serpentlike, with forked tongues, great wisdom, \nand longevity. 41 From Sheba might have come the mysterious life- \ngiving substance called shiba in the Epic of Gilgamesh, dispensed by the \nwife of Uta-Napishtim (Noah), who had become the only immortal \n\n\n\n906 \n\n\n\nman; his wife therefore was a Goddess. When this holy matriarch gave Serpent \n\nshiba to Gilgamesh, he shed his old, diseased skin like a snake, and \n\nemerged from it reborn. 42 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nPersians also maintained the symbolic connections between men- \nstrual blood and the serpent\'s secret of longevity. Mithraists claimed \nimmortality was conferred by the blood of the sacrificial bull, but a \nserpent was there to collect the blood as it flowed from the bull\'s \nbody; and this blood was imitation-menstrual blood in that it was \n"delivered by the moon." 43 \n\nImmortality was the special province of the skin-shedding Serpent \nand the blood-bestowing Goddess from earliest times. Some of the \nvery oldest traditions of the Great Serpent identified him with the \nEarth\'s intestines. Archaic serpent gods like Egyptian Apep and \nSumerian Khumbaba were said to "resemble intestines." 44 In this \nconnection, the biblical phrase for birth or rebirth was "separation \nfrom the bowels." Serpents understood how to restore life to the dead, \naccording to the myths of Crete, where the sorcerer Polyidos learned \nthe serpents\' secret and won great honor at the Minoan court by \nbringing the dead prince Glaucus back to life. 45 \n\nMany Gnostic traditions identified the Serpent with Jesus. In the \nPistis Sophia, Jesus was the serpent who spoke to Eve "from the tree \nof knowledge and the tree of life, which were in the paradise of Adam." \nJewish Naassians (Serpent-worshippers) said the serpent was the \nMessiah. Magic Papyri called him "World Ruler, the Great Serpent, \nleader of gods ... the god of gods." 46 Some Christians held that the \nserpent was the father of Jesus, having "overshadowed" the bed of the \nvirgin Mary and begotten the human form of the Savior. \n\nThese traditions were still extant, though hidden, in Renaissance \ntimes. Barrel Bruyn\'s Gnostic-symbolic painting of the Annunciation \nshowed an unmistakably Hermetic serpent-caduceus as the rod extend- \ned toward Mary by the impregnating angel Gabriel. The Dove \npoised in a halo in its tip, making a sign like a cross between a fairy-wand \nand the emblem of Venus. 47 This made a combined symbol of the \nmale-and-female mystery of the Serpent and Dove, which was inserted \ninto the mouth of Jesus according to Matthew 10:16. Many theolo- \ngians claimed the crucified serpent Nehushtan was a prophecy of Jesus: \n"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must \nthe Son of Man be lifted up" (John 3:1 5). In the 16th century, German \nsmiths made golden thalers with a crucified Christ on one side and a \ncrucified serpent on the other, hinting that they were two faces of the \nsame redeemer. 48 \n\nEvery mythology had some form of the World Serpent. Like the \nHermetic or Gnostic serpent encircling the World Egg, he was a \nbasic Indo-European religious symbol. Norse myth called him the \nMidgard-Worm, who encircled the whole round of Middle-Earth \n(Midgard), his tail in his mouth. 49 Russians called him Koshchei the \nDeathless, encircler of the underworld. 50 This seems to have been a \n\n\n\n907 \n\n\n\nSerpent \n\n\n\nvariation of the Japanese dragon of sea-tides, Koshi. 51 Egyptians called \nhim Sata (Satan), or the Tuat, on whose back the sun god rode \nthrough the underworld each night. Greeks called him Okeanos, the \nsea-serpent of the outermost ocean. \n\nOften the Heavenly Father assumed this serpent form, like Zeus \nMeilichios, worshipped as a gigantic serpent in the 4th century B.C. 52 \nIn the shape of a serpent he became the consort of chthonian Perseph- \none." He also begot heroes on mortal women. Alexander the Great \nwas allegedly fathered by God who in the form of a serpent impreg- \nnated his mother, Queen Olympias. 54 \n\nThe Pyramid Texts spoke of the serpent as both subterranean and \ncelestial. In his heavenly aspect, he was a dispenser of immortality. 55 \nAs the divine phallus in perpetual erection he was the Tree of Life, or \naxis mundi, a Pole passing through the center of heaven and earth \nthat is, Father Heaven coupled to the Goddess\'s "hub." His eye was \nseen as the pole star. In 3000 B.C., the pole star was Alpha Draconis, \nthe Serpent\'s Eye. 56 \n\nThe Mahabharata said the pole star to which the yoke of the world \nwas fixed was "the supreme snake, Vasuki." The same snake was the \nphallic god who stirred the uterine Abyss at creation, according to the \nVedas. 57 Like the God of Genesis, the Vedic deity Indra claimed to \nhave cast down the Great Serpent from heaven into the world- \nencircling abyss of the outer ocean. 58 Like the Bible story, this myth \nre-interpreted the original meaning of the serpent as a descending, \nfertilizing phallus. \n\nThe sexual image of the phallic serpent\'s head as the Jewel in the \nLotus ramified into many versions of the myth of menarche: the \nbelief that menstruation was initiated by copulation with a supernatural \nsnake (see Menstrual Blood). According to this imagery, the divine \nmale serpent acquired a "blood-red jewel" in his head. Hindus said all \nthe great snakes carried blood-red rubies of immortality in their \nheads. 59 \n\nGermans remembered this Aryan lore, and said a serpent with a \nmagic stone in its head would be found at the root of a hazel tree \nwitchwood near mistletoe. The serpent\'s stone was sacred to the \nmoon, and was identified with the Philosopher\'s Stone, which could \nbring eternal life. 60 Remnants of the serpent\'s phallic symbolism \nappeared in medieval magic charms, such as the conviction that "female \ndiseases" could be cured by applying to the sufferer a staff with which \na snake had been beaten. 61 \n\nIn 13th-century France, a snake on a pole like the Ophites\' image \nof Christ was carried in triumphal procession during Easter Week to \nthe baptismal font of the church. 62 Sometimes the fetish was an \nenormous stuffed serpent, like a Chinese carnival dragon. Church- \nmen tried to assimilate the custom by saying the serpent was the devil \n"driven from his kingdom by the Passion of Christ"; but this was but \n\n\n\n908 \n\n\n\na lame explanation for a rite that was already old when Christianity was \nnew. 63 \n\nEarly Ophite Christians adopted serpent worship and claimed \nMoses as the founder of their sect, alleging that Moses taught the \nJews to worship the serpent in the wilderness. 64 Besides, the serpent had \ncertainly given knowledge to Adam and Eve, and therefore was a \nsavior of humanity, an earlier incarnation of Christ who also suffered at \nGod\'s hands for the enlightenment he brought. The Ophites\' holy \nserpents were made to twine around the bread of the Eucharist, and \nwere adored hanging on crosses. Ophite "colleges" still existed in \nBithynia in the 5th century a.d., when bishops began leading mobs to \nwreck the Ophite churches. 65 \n\nMedieval Hermetists worshipped the serpent as Ouroboros, king of \nmagic, a syncretic mixture of the Ophites\' Christ-Ophion, the \nGreeks\' Hermes, the Phoenicians\' Taaut, the Egyptians\' Tuat, and \nother ancient snake-tailed gods including the underground oracle \nPython. 66 Ouroboros was linked with the Chinese p;-dragon, symbol of \nthe universe, carved on jade discs as a dragon or serpent eating its \nown tail. 67 This may have been the prototype of the serpent Python and \nthe Pythagoreans\' worship ofp/as the mystic numerical principle of \nthe circle. Two serpents eating each other\'s tails combined the yang- \nand-yin mandala with the caduceus, expressing the bisexual nature of \nHermes and all cyclic alternations: birth/death, summer/winter, light/ \ndark, etc. The Ouroboros was still pictured under the earth in certain \nEuropean areas, and some people claimed to be able to feel his slow \nmovements through their feet when they stood in the ancient shrines. \n\nl.Briffault 2, 643-48. 2.

Dr. Joseph Fletcher of the Episcopal Theological School wrote, \n"The Christian churches must shoulder much of the blame for the \nconfusion, ignorance, and guilt which surrounds sex in Western \nculture [T]he Christian church, from its earliest primitive begin- \nnings, had been swayed by many Puritanical people, both Catholic \nand Protestant, who have viewed sex as inherently evil." \' \n\nOthers have been less forgiving, and stated bluntly that Christian \nchurches must shoulder not just "much of the blame, but all of it. \nR.E.L. Masters declared, "Almost the entire blame for the hideous \nnightmare that was the witch mania, and the greatest part of the \nblame for poisoning the sexual life of the West, rests squarely on the \nRoman Catholic Church." 2 The rest of the blame presumably \ndevolves upon Protestantism, for there was no institution in western \nculture other than Christianity that made any effort to teach human \nbeings to hate or fear sex. \n\nChristian abhorrence of sex began with the fathers of the church, \nwho insisted that the kingdom of God couldn\'t be established until \nthe human race was allowed to die out through universal celibacy. 5 \nMarcion announced that all propagation must be abandoned at once. \nSt. Jerome ordered: "Regard everything as poison which bears within it \nthe seed of sensual pleasure." 4 St. Athanasius declared the great \nrevelation and blessing brought by Jesus was knowledge of the saving \n\n\n\n910 \n\n\n\ngrace of chastity. 5 Tertullian said chastity was "a means whereby a \nman will traffic in a mighty substance of sanctity," whereas the sex act \nrendered even marriage "obscene." 6 \n\nNumenius of Apamea proclaimed that only total cessation of all \nsexual activity could bring about the union of the soul with God. 7 St. \nAugustine pronounced the doctrine that "concupiscence" is the root of \noriginal sin and the means of transmitting Adam\'s guilt to all \ngenerations. Thus he sealed the church\'s commitment to asceticism, at \nleast in theory, for the next 1600 years. 8 Augustine said sexual \nintercourse is never sinless, even within marriage. 9 Augustine didn\'t \ninvent this doctrine. He got it from Gnostic Manicheans, to whose \nsect he belonged before his conversion to orthodoxy. Gnostics taught \nthat souls are entrapped in flesh by "the mystery of love and lust, \nthrough which all the worlds are inflamed." This teaching probably \ncame ultimately from ascetic Jain Buddhist yogis, who enjoined the \nsame precept as the First Book of John: "Love not the world, neither \nthings that are in the world ... for all that is in the world, the lust of \nthe flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the \nFather." 10 \n\nThese views became more entrenched as time went on. Medieval \ntheologians said sex "caused the damnation of humanity, which was \non its account put out of Paradise, and for its sake Christ was killed." 1 1 \nOfficials of the Inquisition taught in their handbooks that women\'s \n"carnal lust" was the cause of witchcraft and Satanism, since God \n"allows the devil more power over the venereal act, by which the \noriginal sin is handed down, than over all other human actions . . . \nbecause of its natural nastiness." 12 \n\nThe church promulgated legends about saints so devoted to \nchastity that they preferred extreme physical torment to sexual \npleasure. St. Paul the Hermit was tied down by the wicked emperor \nDecius and subjected to the lascivious caresses of a harlot. As soon as \nhe felt his penis rise, "having no weapon with which to defend himself, \n[he] bit off his tongue and spat it into the face of the lewd woman." \nThe sainted Pope Leo was so pure that when "a woman kissed his \nhand, and aroused in him a violent temptation of the flesh," he cut \nhis hand off. By singular good fortune it was restored by the Holy Virgin \nso he could continue to perform religious ceremonies. 13 \n\nThe early church attacked most bitterly the many pagan faiths \nthat made sex a central holy sacrament, enacting union of the Great \nGoddess and her phallic consorts. Tertullian denounced "the whore- \ndoms of Eleusis," and Eusebius condemned "the unnameable rites of \nthe mysteries, adulteries and yet baser lusts." Yet Plato and his \ncontemporaries had worshipped Eros, god of sexual love, as "the most \nvenerable of the deities, the most worthy of honor, the most powerful \nto grant virtue and blessedness unto mankind both in life and after \ndeath." 14 \n\nFrom the most primitive period, European pagans incorporated \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nNumenius of Apa- \nmea Neopythagorean \nand Platonic philoso- \npher, born in Syria \nduring the 2nd cen- \ntury a.d.; influential in \nthe school of \nPlotinus. \n\n\n\n911 \n\n\n\nSex sex into their religion. The word Lust in old Germanic languages \n\nmeant "religious joy." 15 At their holy feasts, Norsemen sang songs the \n^^^^^^^^^^_ Christians called "lewd and shameful," and danced hip-swinging \n\ndances the Christians called "female gyrations." 16 The people refused \nto give these up, believing them essential to general fertility. When \nseasons went awry and crops failed under the first Christianized kings, \nthe peasants were sure the cause was neglect of the old deities\' rites. 17 \nSexuality was reverenced in cultures where the female principle \nwas accorded freedom and honor, as in Egypt, where women chose \nand wooed their lovers at will. 18 Egyptians described carnal knowledge \nas "knowing a woman perfectly," and regarded it as a joy. Sages \ncounseled men never to be rude to a mistress or wife, nor to try to order \nher about; it would be unseemly in one with whom she shared \n"joy." 19 This was like the Tantric identification of sexual bliss with the \nbliss of the Goddess and God as they continually engendered life in \nthe universe. 20 Hindus said intercourse with any woman is like union \nwith the Goddess herself. Far from being sinful, "to have carnal \nintercourse with the Goddess Parvati is a virtue which destroys all sin." 21 \n\nBut in the Christian view, woman brought death into the world \nand sex perpetuated it. 22 It was claimed that Adam was made to be \nimmortal, but he lost both his innocence and his immortality when Eve \ntaught him about sex. All women were copies of Eve, said Tertullian; \n"the unsealer of that Tree," her very existence bringing destruction to \n"God\'s image, man." 25 Women were dangerous even when dead. \nAn early church edict ordered that a male corpse must not be buried \nnext to a female corpse until the latter was safely decomposed. 24 \n\nSt. John Chrysostom said a man "cannot endure" looking at a \nwoman. 25 A biographer of St. Augustine assumed automatically that \n"because of his great holiness, he was unwilling to look upon a woman\'s \nface." 26 St. Augustine\'s doctrine of original sin was destined to \ncrucify not only Christ but the whole of the western world with its anti- \npleasure, pro-pain philosophy. 27 Even today it is hardly possible for \nanyone brought up in one of the western nations to comprehend the \nancient world\'s opinion of sex as an experience of divine pleasure or a \npreview of heaven, without deliberate, laborious intellectual progress \ntoward such an opinion. \n\nNot only was Europe crucified by Christian antisexuality but also \nmuch of Oceania, Africa, and the Far East. Wherever Christian \nmissionaries went which was everywhere people were told their \nown generally healthy sexual attitudes were wrong and sinful. One \nmissionary described Bantu harvest festivals as Bacchic feasts: "It is \nimpossible to witness them without being ashamed. Men and wom- \nen, who in ordinary circumstances are modest in behavior and speech, \nthen abandon themselves to licentiousness." Another missionary \nwrote: "I have seen the most indelicate performances in the shape of \ndances or theatrical pieces in front of the Badago temples, and on \nbearing witness to their wickedness have been told that the god \ndelighted in them." 28 \n\n\n\n912 \n\n\n\nA missionary in Malaya observed that the natives engaged in all of \nwhat he called the carnal sins except one: rape. 29 He didn\'t follow up \nthe thought to the prevalence of rape in his own society; but today\'s \npsychologists are beginning to understand the leading role played by \nsexual repression in developing the kind of woman-hatred that leads to \nrape. Western thinkers have only recently caught on to the fact that \ncultural suppression of the need for bodily pleasure will inevitably result \nin perverted expression through cruelty. 50 \n\nCruelty to both women and children was the early Christian \nsubstitute for the affection usually shown them in less ascetic societ- \nies. The Apostolic Constitutions called for severe physical punishment \nof children. Fathers (not mothers) were told: "Do not hesitate to \nreprove them, chastening them with severity. . . . Teach your children \nthe word of the Lord, straiten them even with stripes and render \nthem submissive, teaching them from infancy the Holy Scriptures." 31 \n\nRecent experiments have shown that inhibition of sexual responses \n(in animals) is associated with aggressive cruelty, whereas sexual \npermissiveness goes with peaceful co-existence. While some investiga- \ntors theorized that aggression and lust rise together from a common \nsource, experiments don\'t support this belief. Instead, it seems one \nalternative inhibits the other. 32 Christianity made all Europe a vast \nexperiment in sexual inhibition, with predictable results. In one of \nhistory\'s most cruel ages, Thomas Browne spoke of a nearly total \nrejection of sex: "I would be content that we might procreate like trees, \nwithout conjunction, or that there were any other way to perpetuate \nthe World without this trivial and vulgar way of union." 33 \n\nIn 1721 Beaumont ordered the pious to reject any and all \nsensual pleasures, even the most subtle or involuntary ones: \n\nIf ye perceive a sudden sweet taste in your mouths or feel any warmth in \nyour breasts, like tire, or any form of pleasure in any part of your body, \nor . . . if ye become aware by occasion of pleasure or satisfaction derived \nfrom such perception, that your hearts are drawn away from the \ncontemplation of Jesus Christ and from spiritual exercises . . . then this \nsensation is very much to be suspected of coming from the Enemy; and \ntherefore were it ever so wonderful and striking, still renounce it and do \nnot consent to accept it. ** \n\nInhibition of sensual impulses was the keynote of western \nmorality up to and including the I9th century, when Dr. Alcott \nauthoritatively stated that even marital sex should never be indulged \nmore than once a month. Any greater frequency was "prostitution of \nthe matrimonial life." 35 For many centuries the church insisted that \nmarital sex should be as barren of sensual pleasure as possible, and that \norgasms in women were unseemly or even devilish. The "missionary \nposition" was the only permitted sexual position, because it afforded the \nleast pleasure, especially to the wife. \n\nIn consequence of such socialization, "good" women were fre- \nquently sex-haters. Bertrand Russell said of his first wife that "she had \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nApostolic Consti- \ntutions Short title of \nthe Ordinances of \nthe Holy Apostles \nThrough Clement, \nforged documents pur- \nporting to be \necclesiastical laws laid \ndown by the apostles \nand their immediate \nsuccessors. In reality, \nthe Constitutions were \nwritten by an anony- \nmous Syrian author \ntoward the end of the \n4th century. \n\nSir Thomas Browne \n\n(1605-1682) English \nphysician, author of \nthe famous Religio \nMedici and other \nworks. \n\n\n\nDr. William A. Al- \ncott American \nphysician who un- \ndertook the instruction \nof married couples in \nhis two books, The \nYoung Wife (1837) \nand The Young Hus- \nband (1839). \n\n\n\n913 \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nThomas Branagan \n\nAmerican author of \nThe Excellency of \nFemale Character Vin- \ndicated, 1808. \n\n\n\nbeen brought up, as American women always were in those days, to \nthink that sex was beastly, that all women hated it, and that men\'s \nbrutal lusts were the chief obstacle to happiness in marriage." 36 \n\nA Christian scripture falsely attributed to St. Dionysius, Of the \nNames of God, said the name of Love was not suitable for God, \n"because one could only honor God, not love Him." 37 Love was left to \nthe sinful, bearing out Nietzsche\'s observation that "Christianity gave \nEros poison to drink; he did not die of it but degenerated into a vice." 38 \nOnly recently has it even been suggested that love, or Eros, is \nessential to the moral development of a man, in a sense that was never \nhinted at by the moralists of the west. A man may rise to "a new \nmoral plane" by falling in love, a process that cannot be pursued \nthrough any rationally established program. Western society doesn\'t \nunderstand how to instill a comfortably "instinctive" morality into any \nindividual, even with the opportunity to work on the problem from \nearliest childhood let alone to improve the moral outlook of an adult. \nBut a man\'s emotional commitment to a beloved, if sincere, may \nradically alter and improve his whole view of the world, of himself, of \nright and wrong, and of the individual\'s relations with and responsibil- \nities toward others. 39 \n\nPatriarchal religion was devoted to destruction of the sensual \nfemale nature that elicited and responded to such emotional commit- \nments. Women\'s sexual desire or pleasure was generally considered \ndetrimental to the marital relationship. 40 A standard Christian work \non sex dedicated to Cardinal d\'Este, Sinibaldi\'s 1 7th-century Geneanth- \nropeia, said no woman could conceive if she enjoyed sex. 41 Before \nthe turn of the last century, it was expected that "good" women would \nknow nothing of sexual pleasure. If they showed an inclination to \nlearn, they might be cruelly teased. Thomas Branagan\'s advice to young \nmen was to test the virtue of a fiancee by trying to seduce her, to \nmake sure she would react with "becoming abhorrence." If she seemed \ntoo compliant, she must be jilted. 42 \n\nThe name of John Bowdler became a byword for his pious labors \nin removing all risque words from the Bible, Shakespeare, etc. He \neven objected to any mention of women\'s traditional care of the sick or \nof infants, on moral grounds: "Few women have any idea [Bowdler\'s \nitalics] how much men are disgusted by the slightest approach to these \nin any female. ... By attending the nursery or sick bed, women are \ntoo apt to acquire a habit of conversing on such subjects in language \nwhich men of delicacy are shocked at." 43 Male "delicacy" even \ndictated that the books of male and female authors must be kept on \nseparate bookshelves unless the authors "happen to be married." 44 \n\nThe Victorian authority on sex was Dr. William Acton, who \ncouldn\'t heap too much praise on "all those mysterious sensations \nwhich make up what we call VIRILITY," a quality that "seems \nnecessary to give a man that consciousness of his dignity, or his \ncharacter as head and ruler and of his importance, which is absolutely \n\n\n\n914 \n\n\n\nessential to the well-being of his family, and through it, of society itself. Sex \n\nt is a power, a privilege, of which the man is, and should be, proud." \n\n3ut women were permitted no such pride in their sexual nature. "As a ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ngeneral rule," said Acton, "a modest woman seldom desires any \n\nexual gratification for herself. She submits to her husband, but only to \n\njlease him; and, but for the desire of maternity, would far rather be \n\nelieved of his attentions." Acton admitted however that there were a \n\njew sad exceptions to his rule, who might be found either in the \n\nlivorce courts or in lunatic asylums, suffering from "the form of insanity \n\nrailed nymphomania." 45 \n\nThose women labeled nymphomaniacs and imprisoned in Victori- \nin asylums were frequently women who had somehow stumbled \nlpon discovery of their own orgasmic capacity and found to their \nlismay that men neither knew nor cared anything about it. Even \n"reud\'s view of female sexuality was all wrong. For over fifty years, \nloctors slavishly followed Freud\'s interpretation and wondered why \nhere were so many "frigid" women, whose sexual readiness was \n:onstantly aroused to no purpose until they rejected sex out of sheer \nrustration. "It is remarkable that only recently has Freud\'s classic theory \n>n the sexuality of women the notion of the double orgasm been \nictually tested and found just plain wrong." 46 \n\nThe 20th century was not much more enlightened than the 19th. \nStall\'s marriage manual, the ultimate authority at the turn of the \nentury, blamed women themselves for the sexual ignorance society \nmposed on them. If a wife failed to understand her husband\'s sexual \nleeds, she was to blame "for her lack of knowledge and consider- \nition." 47 But men\'s lack of knowledge and consideration was part of \nhe culture. \n\nThe oft-heard complaint directed by women at the clumsiness, crassness, \nand incompetence of men in their sexual approaches and in sexual \nintercourse itself, men \'s lack of skill in foreplay and their failure to \nunderstand its meaning, almost certainly substantially reflects the lack \nof tactile experience that many males have suffered in childhood. The \nroughness with which many men will handle women and children \nconstitutes yet another evidence of their having been failed in early tactile \nexperience, for it is difficult to conceive of anyone who had been \ntenderly loved and caressed in infancy not learning to approach a woman \nor a child with especial tenderness. The very word "tenderness" \nimplies softness, delicacy of touch, caring for. The gorilla, that gentle \ncreature, is the most frequently slandered when women wish to \ndescribe the sexual approaches of the average male. Sex seems to be \nregarded as a tension releaser rather than as a profoundly meaningful \nact of communication in a deeply involved human relationship.\' 18 \n\nOne modern woman a rape victim thus expressed her own view \nof sex: \n\nSex, for men, is totally oriented toward the man $ orgasm and isn \'t \nsuccessful unless it involves intercourse and orgasm, which is ridiculous, \n\n\n\n915 \n\n\n\ne~ because sex to me is a much more sensual, much more emotional \n\nexperience. It doesn \'t involve just one particular spot on the body getting \nexcited and aroused, and then it\'s over, and it \'s either a success or \n\n^^^^^^^^^ failure.\'\' 9 \n\nMen culturally trained not to pay attention to women seldom \nunderstood what women meant by "love," even when they tried to \nexplain. The celebrated Kinsey reports on American sexual behavior \ndidn\'t mention "love" in their index. 50 Certainly there was no such idea \nin America as the Tantric karuna, which combined all forms of love \nin communion with the female, though modern women sometimes try \nto grope toward this concept, unaware that it was elucidated long ago: \n\nGestation . . . is a complex inner process in which sexuality is fed by \neverything else a woman has at her disposal, much in the same way that \nshe might feed a fetus. When there is no fetus, an inclusive kind of sexual \nintimacy fills up a comparable inner space. But when sex is separated \nfrom that context, the disparity between a penetration that is no more than \nan "action " and a penetration that reaches into complex inner space \ncan become quite overwhelming. . . . \n\nTo most men the problem . . . does not seem very real. To them the \nclearest aim of sex is orgasm, that moment of intense physical intimacy \nand satisfaction which so often serves as a substitute for other kinds of \nintimacy. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why men seem to be so \nconcerned with satisfying women sexually and interpret that satisfaction in \nterms of what they think would satisfy them if they were women. It \nmay also be one of the reasons why men seem to think that many women \ncan never be completely satisfied sexually. The terrain where a woman \nremains forever unsatisfied or even, as they say, "insatiable, " is probably \nthe area where her sexuality borders most closely on that more complex \npsycho-sexual area of her being. 5I \n\nIn Oriental countries where an image of the Goddess was \nretained, broader ideas of sexuality were retained also: \n\nWestern attitudes . . . look on sexual intercourse as a matter of tension, \nappetite and relief. . . according to the simplistic biological conception \nwhich is still current. . . . It is well known that the man who, in the Kinsey \nReport on the Human Male, recorded a frequency above thirty times a \nday for many years became a kind of folk-hero in America. Sexual love, in \nsuch a context, becomes at best a matter of frequently happily shared \norgasms. \n\nTo the traditional Indian mind this attitude is grotesque and pathet- \nic. Even the ordinary man recognized that such banality was absurd. ... \nEighteenth-century Indian harlots mocked European men for their \nmiserable sexual performance, calling them "dunghill cocks" for whom \nthe act was over in a few seconds. Despite recent advances in sexological \nknowledge, the West\'s chosen external explanations of sex, attached as \nthey are to a provisional and impoverished rationalization of the infinite \ncomplex of human experience, still tend to regard sex as the pursuit of \norgasm Traditional India did not." \n\nA mystical or poetic view of sex, like the Indian one, seemed to \n\n\n\n916 \n\n\n\njar the puritan consciousness even more than a "dirty" or degraded Sex \n\nview. Dr. Marie Stopes\'s Married Love was imported from England \n\nin 1918 but banned for obscenity in the U.S., chiefly on account of ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsuch delirious passages as the following: \n\nThe half-swooning sense of flux which overtakes the spirit in their eternal \nmoment at the apex of rapture sweeps into its flaming tides the whole \nessence of the man and woman, and as it were, the heat of the contact \nvaporizes their consciousness so that it Alls the whole of cosmic space. \nFor the moment they are identified with the divine thoughts, the waves of \neternal force, which to the Mystic often appear in terms of golden \nlight." \n\nSome progress has been made since the sexual obtuseness of \nwestern men made them a laughingstock in India. But recent investiga- \ntors found "a view of sex that is as distorted as the Victorian, for it is \nstill shrouded with the unrealistic expectations and outmoded standards \nof gender behavior of the past. Fantasy rather than reality is its \nkeynote; hostility, anxiety, and guilt are aggravated rather than alleviat- \ned." 54 Significantly, a male author characterizes male sexuality as \nloveless and death-centered, capable of destroying the foundations of \nsociety: \n\nContemporary eroticism attempts to free woman sexually but according to \na masculine conception of sexuality. . . . The present rehabilitation of \nthe erotic in its purely sexual, loveless aspect is completely at variance with \nthe truly feminine conception . . . an ultimate striving toward disloca- \ntion, destruction, and death Thanatos as against Eros, the love-filled \nerotic, unifying and conservationist. . . . Ultimately, this overemphasis \nof the masculine component in Western society threatens to destroy its \nfoundations. fs \n\nTo counterbalance the destructiveness of male-dominated soci- \nety, nothing could be effective except recognition of the feminine \nprinciple, according to George Sand: "It will be in the female heart \npar excellence, as it always has been, that love and devotion, patience \nand pity, will find their true home. On woman falls the duty, in a \nworld of brute passions, of preserving the virtue of charity. . . . When \nwoman ceases to play that role, life will be the loser." 56 Modern \nthinkers also regret the loss of cultural emphasis on the feminine \nmorality that can integrate sex with affection, tenderness, and sensi- \ntivity toward others\' emotional needs. It has been often said that \nmale-dominated societies tend to burden the sexual impulses of both \nwomen and men with basically unrelated guilts, fears, angers, and their \nresulting aggressions. Some forms of "entertainment" for example \ntake advantage of the new frankness to introduce disturbingly sadistic \nelements into mass socialization for sexual adulthood. "Rather than \nlament the fact that sexual appetite is now being encouraged, we might \nmore profitably spend our time trying to ensure that the emotions \nthat are integrated with it are the ones we approve of." 57 \n\n\n\n917 \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nAs recently as 1966, an anthropological study of the Irish \nislanders of Inis Beag revealed a mini-culture of 19th-century Christian- \npatriarchal patterns in sexual life. Female orgasm was unknown. \nWomen were trained to endure rather than enjoy sex. Men habitually \nejaculated within seconds. Modesty was the overwhelming preoccu- \npation of both sexes; husbands and wives didn\'t see each other naked. \nSexual foreplay consisted of rough fondling outside the sleeping \ngarments. No coital position other than Venus observa was used. \n\nPremarital sex was virtually unknown, since young couples were \nnever alone together. Not even "walking out," the old-fashioned \nversion of dating, was allowed. Young people received no instruction in \nsexual matters. The islanders said after marriage "nature would take \nits course" without the embarrassment of discussion. \n\nThough the men were often at sea in small boats, they never \nlearned to swim, being unwilling to undress in public for this purpose. \n"Bathing" in the sea meant wading, fully clothed. The sexes were \nrigidly separated for this activity. Men were known to die of disease or \ninjury rather than to go to a hospital on the mainland, where they \nthought their bodies would be bared to the eyes of female nurses. \n\nEven the dogs of Inis Beag were whipped for licking their genitals \nor other "obscene" behavior. Imported copies of American maga- \nzines such as Life or Time were denounced from the pulpit as \npornography. Fear of female "mysteries" was overt: women were not \napproached sexually for many months after childbirth, or during men- \nstruation, when men thought them especially dangerous. Predictably, \nsevere repression exacted a severe toll in quarrelsomeness, alcoholism, \nviolence, and frequent mental disturbances. 58 \n\nParadoxically, the more sexuality is banned and ignored, the more \nfear it seems to engender in men. A patriarchal-ascetic ethic seems to \narrange sexual attitudes according to the way men would like them \narranged, but it doesn\'t work well even for men. A psychiatrist says, \n"In the privacy of our consulting room we do from time to time see \nstrong men fret, and hear them talk of women with dread and horror \nand awe, as if women, far from being timid creatures to be patronized, \nwere as powerful as the sea and inescapable as fate. . . . Man, con- \nfronted by woman, does seem to feel, variously, frightened, revolted, \ndominated, bewildered, and even, at times, superfluous." 59 One male \nauthor in a revealing passage on men\'s sexual feelings refers to a woman \nas "it," but also admits "general helplessness in the face of her," and a \nsense of her "awesomeness and power" seemingly overblown terms \nfor an ordinary human female: \n\nWe cannot relate to the total object as it [sic] is, and thus we need \nstandardized definitions of sexual attractiveness. These we get in the \nform of "cues" that serve to cut the object down to manageable size: we \nlook at the breast or the black underwear, which allow us not really to \nhave to take account of the total person we are relating to. . . . [W]e strip \n\n\n\n918 \n\n\n\nthe partner of awesomeness and power and so overcome our general Sex \n\nhelplessness in the face of her. 60 \n\nThe symbols of "sexiness" are created and instilled by the HmHi^Hi \n\nsociety, however odd it may seem to realize that human physiological \nresponses can actually be keyed to abstract images. "It is now quite \nclear that how a person behaves sexually is largely determined not by \ninborn factors but by learning." 61 The prevailing conventional wis- \ndom and its influence on the growing child determine whether most \npeople will enjoy sex or hate it, perceiving their own bodies as heaven \nor hell. Western anti-sexuality has created many individuals tending \ntoward the "hate" or "hell" end of the spectrum, epitomized by a \npsychiatric patient who said, "Somehow I always think that sexual \ni intercourse is a great disgrace for humans." A female patient called \nher body an "abhorrent envelope," and said, "I wish I could tear this \nskin off. If I didn\'t have this stupid body, I would be as pure outside as \nI feel inside." 62 \n\nWomen have an especially difficult time with the body-image in a \nsociety that attaches little value to their complex body-oriented roles \nof wife, mother, nurturer, or comforter; and may even cease to play \nthese roles when they have fully accepted the value system of the \ndominant sex. Women don\'t reject traditional "feminine" roles out of \nperversity, nor because of that Freudian absurdity, penis envy. Like \nmen, most women prefer to do what their society values and rewards. If \nthe wife-and-mother role is undervalued or even deprecated, as it \nhas been throughout the past two millenia in the western world \nwomen can hardly be blamed for seeking valid achievement in other \nfields. 63 In our society the universal standard of valuation is money, and \nthe so-called "career" of wife-and-mother earns none at all. \n\nUnderevaluation of the mother affects sons as well as daughters, \nsince the mother\'s reaction to social expectations of her inevitably \ncreates a deep impression on her children. "Psychiatric observation \nsuggests that human sexual behavior is subtly shaped by the nature of \nthe social attachments formed during a person\'s development"; and the \nmother is the primary social attachment. 64 Chodorow says the mod- \nern civilized male "is in the unhappy position of being able to attain \nmasculine identity almost solely through efforts to distinguish himself \nfrom the person closest to him [the mother], with whom he might most \nnaturally identify. His efforts commonly take the form of a rather \nprimitive rejection of all that is \'feminine\' in women and in himself." 65 \n\nSexual development is further hampered by conventional religions \nwhich still attach fear and guilt to almost every stage of the process. \nIgnoring recent proofs that masturbation is necessary for development \nof normal orgasmic capacity in both sexes, Pope Paul VI\'s 1976 \ndeclaration on sexual ethics pronounced masturbation "a grave moral \ndisorder." Moreover, within the framework of marriage, only the \n"finality" of procreation could "ensure the moral goodness" of sex in \n\n\n\n919 \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nother words, sex must make babies, not pleasure. 66 As for premarital \nsex, Norman Vincent Peale declared it a dreadful sin even for persons \ndeeply in love; they cannot be forgiven without prolonged spiritual \n"treatment." 67 \n\nIt is now said that sexual appetites have "little or no relation to \n\nbiological or physiological needs [Ejrotic urges stem more from \n\nsocio-cultural factors than from those of the strictly physiological na- \nture." 68 Therefore the broad extent of ugly or cruel sexual behavior \npatterns in modern society should stimulate serious thought about what \nthe society is teaching. In 1972, the Chief of the Sex Section of the \nWashington D.C. Police Department reported: "The newspapers print \nonly what they want to. I tell them about little girls of seven or eight \nwho come up with venereal diseases inflicted on them by male mem- \nbers of their own families. An appalling number of 1 1- and \n12-year-olds are giving birth after being raped by their own fathers. But \nthey won\'t print things like this. They\'re only heart-breaking and \nhorrible not sensational." 69 \n\nA report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography \nconcluded: "Failure to talk openly and directly about sex . . . overem- \nphasizes sex, gives it a magical nonnatural quality Such failure \n\nmakes teaching children and adolescents to become fully and ade- \nquately functioning sexual adults a more difficult task The very \n\nfoundation of our society rests upon healthy sexual attitudes grounded \nin appropriate and accurate sexual information." 70 In other words, the \nfoundations of society rest on dissemination of precisely the kind of \ninformation that Christian morality insisted on withholding from one \nand all men, women, and children. \n\nChurches today have largely renounced all their responsibility to \nestablish guidelines for sexual development or sexual behavior, leaving \ntheir congregations in an area of confusion. Theologians stress "the \npersonal responsibility of the Christian to find God\'s will for himself." 71 \nIn which case, he hardly needs a church. \n\nI. S. Harris, 255. 2. R.E.L. Masters, xxvi. 3.

St. John Chry- \nsostom said men suffer "a thousand evils" from having to look at \nwomen; "the beauty of women is the greatest snare." St. Odo of Cluny \nrefused to be ensnared; he said, "How should we desire to embrace \nwhat is no more than a sack of dung!" According to Walter Map, \n"Even the very good woman, who is rarer than the phoenix, cannot \nbe loved without the loathesome bitterness of fear and worry and \nconstant unhappiness." A 19th-century Anglican churchman said \nwomen are "intrinsically inferior in excellence, imbecile by sex and \nnature, weak in body, inconstant in mind, and imperfect and infirm \nin character." 5 In the 1890s, the president of a leading theological \nseminary declared, "My Bible commands the subjection of women \nforever." 6 \n\nSo it did. Through the centuries, the Bible supported sexist \nsentiments which were echoed by all churchmen. St. Paul said: "The \nhead of every man is Christ; and the head of every woman is the man" \n(1 Corinthians 1 1:3). St. Peter said in the Gospel of Thomas: \n"Women are not worthy of life." 7 Clement of Alexandria quoted the \nwords of Christ from the Gospel According to the Egyptians: "I have \ncome to destroy the works of the female." 8 He added: "Every woman \nought to be filled with shame at the thought that she is a woman." 9 \n\nUp to the modern era, clergymen continued to appeal to biblical \nauthority to maintain the political subjection of women. "The clergy \nwere often in the forefront of the fight against suffrage, dredging up \nquotations from the Bible to prove that the natural order of things was \nfemale obedience to man." Simone de Beauvoir says: "For the Jews, \nMohammedans and Christians among others, man is master by divine \nright, the fear of God will therefore repress any impulse towards \nrevolt in the downtrodden female." As late as 1971 an Episcopalian \nbishop confirmed these views: "The sexuality of Christ is no accident \nnor is his masculinity incidental. This is the divine choice." Feminists \nbelieve that even if the churches should destroy themselves in the \neffort, they will cling to their notion of male supremacy to the very end, \nfor this was their primary foundation in the beginning. 10 Theology\'s \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nSt. John Chrysostom, \n\n"Golden-mouthed \nJohn," 4th-century \nChristian orator who \nserved as Patriarch of \nConstantinople until he \nincurred the wrath of \nthe empress Eudoxia, \nwho arranged to \nhave him deposed and \nexiled. \n\nWalter Map Canon \nof St. Paul\'s, Lincoln, \nand Hereford; arch- \ndeacon of Oxford; \necclesiastical justice \nattached to the court of \nHenry II in the late \n1 2th century. Map was \n(probably falsely) \ncredited with authorship \nof some of the older \nArthurian legends. \n\n\n\n921 \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nentire conceptual system was invented by men to serve the interests of \nmen and, not incidentally, to restrict and suppress the interests of \nwomen." \n\nChurch fathers long ago laid down the principle of woman\'s guilt \nfor the existence of death and sin. Augustine blamed the perpetuation \nof original sin on the "concupiscence" that united male bodies with \nfemale ones under any circumstances, including marriage. 12 Chris- \ntianity was the first religion to announce that it was sinful just to be alive, \non account of having been sexually conceived and born of a wom- \nan. 13 St. John Chrysostom commanded every Christian father to instill \n\ninto his son "a resolute spirit against womankind Let him have \n\nno converse with any woman save only his mother. Let him see no \nwoman." 14 \n\nSometimes the writings of Christian men revealed an almost \nhysterical fear of woman. Her very glance could "infect, entice, \nbewitch." Her eyes "poison and intoxicate the mind: yea, her company \ninduceth impudency, corrupteth virginity, confoundeth and consu- \nmeth the bodies, the goods, and the very souls of men. And finally her \nbody destroyeth and rotteth the very flesh and bones of man\'s body." \nVairus said women become witches because "they have such an \nunbridled force of fury and concupiscence naturally. . . . And they \nare so troubled with evil humors, that out go their venomous exhala- \ntions, engendered through their illfavored diet, and increased by \nmeans of their pernicious excrements, which they expel." 15 \n\nJohn Aylmer labeled all women "tale-bearers, eavesdroppers, ru- \nmor raisers, evil tongued, worse minded, and in every wise doltified \nwith the dregs of the Devil\'s dung hill." 16 Similar opinions have been \noffered by modern woman-abusers, such as the rapist: "I thought . . . \nwomen were trashy, low-down and scummy because that\'s what I had \nbeen taught." 17 \n\nAndrew the Chaplain said woman is "by nature a miser, envious, a \nslanderer . . . greedy, a slave to her belly, inconstant, fickle . . . disobe- \ndient and impatient of restraint, spotted with the sin of pride and \ndesirous of vainglory, a liar, a drunkard, a babbler, no keeper of \nsecrets, too much given to wantonness, prone to every evil, and never \nloving any man in her heart." 18 \n\nJohn Scotus Erigena taught that human beings were once without \nsin and without sexuality; but after they disobeyed God, they were \ndivided into two sexes. The sinless part was embodied in man, the sinful \npart in woman. 19 Other theologians said woman was "the confusion \nof man, an insatiable beast, a continuous anxiety, an incessant warfare, a \ndaily ruin." The church ostensibly made war on the devil, but in \nactual practice made war on women. "Woman was the Church\'s rival, \nthe temptress, the distraction, the obstacle to holiness, the Devil\'s \ndecoy." 20 Official church literature said: \n\nAll wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman [T]he \n\nnatural reason is that she is more carnal than a man, as is clear from her \n\n\n\n922 \n\n\n\nmany carnal abominations. And it should be noted that there was a defect \nin the formation of the first woman, since she was formed from a bent \nrib, that is, a rib of the breast, which is bent as it were in a contrary \ndirection to a man. And since through this defect she is an imperfect \nanimal, she always deceives. 2 \' \n\nCuriously enough, modern genetic research indicates that the \ntruth may be something like the reverse of this view. The XY chromo- \nsome that produces a male is physiologically an "incomplete" female \nchromosome. Some individuals are born with an XYY chromosome \nabnormality, making them genetic super-males. They are said to be \ntall, below average in intelligence, and strongly disposed to criminal \nbehavior. 22 \n\nThis would have surprised men like Orestes Brownson, who \ninsisted that woman\'s "ambition and natural love of power" must be \nsubject to masculine control, otherwise "she is out of her element, and a \nsocial anomaly, sometimes a hideous monster, which men seldom \nare, excepting through a woman\'s influence." 23 Such men never \nbothered to notice that their denunciations of women were self- \ncontradictory; as in this case, for instance, if woman\'s love of power was \n"natural," then in exercising it she would be in her element, not out \nof it. \n\nMartin Luther claimed the physical differences between men and \nwomen demonstrated God\'s plan for sexism. "Men have broad and \nlarge chests and small and narrow hips and more understanding than \nwomen who have but small and narrow chests and broad hips, to the \nend that they should remain at home, sit still, keep house and bear and \nbring up children." 24 But if their bearing and bringing up children \nwore them out, it was no matter, Luther said: "If women get tired and \ndie of bearing, there is no harm in that; let them die as long as they \nbear; they were made for that." 25 \n\nSchopenhauer, who detested women, found nothing likeable \nabout their physical appearance: "It is only the man whose intellect is \nclouded by his sexual impulses that could give the name of the fair sex \nto that undersized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short- \nlegged race. . . . [T]he sympathies that exist between them and men are \nskin-deep only, and do not touch the mind or the feelings or the \ncharacter." 26 Hartley tends to agree that thanks to Christian tradition, \n"An extreme outward sex-attraction has come to veil but thinly a \ndeep inward sex-antipathy, until it seems almost impossible that women \nand men can ever really understand one another." 27 \n\nThose few Renaissance men who would speak on behalf of \n( women were outside the church, and usually suspected of heresy, like \nAgrippa von Nettesheim, who wrote that women "are treated by the \nmen as conquered by the conquerors, not by any divine necessity, for \nany reason, but according to custom, education, fortune, and the \ntyrant\'s opportunity." \n\nThe tyranny of men prevailing over divine right and the laws of nature, \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nOrestes Augustus \nBrownson (1803-1876) \nU. S. arbiter of opin- \nion, writer on \nspiritualism, religion, \nsocial reform, states\' \nrights, etc.; publisher \nof Brownson \'s Quarter- \nly, 1844-75. \n\n\n\n923 \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nJosephine Henry \n\n19th-century Kentucky \nsuffragist and \npamphleteer, active in \nthe women\'s rights \nmovement. \n\n\n\nslays by law the liberty of woman, abolishes it by use and custom, and \nextinguishes it by education. For the woman, as soon as she is born, is \nfrom her earliest years detained at home in idleness, and as if destitute \nof capacity for higher occupations, is permitted to conceive of nothing \nbeyond needle and thread. Then when she has attained years of \npuberty she is delivered over to the jealous empire of a man, or shut up \nforever in a shop of vestals. The law also forbids her to fill public \noffices. No prudence entitles her to plead in open court. 28 \n\nThere was sex discrimination even in the penalties imposed for \nwitchcraft. Female witches were more severely punished than male \nwitches. A law of 1683 said that for the crime of causing death by \nwitchcraft, a man may be hanged, but a woman must be burned at the \nstake. Men could with impunity kill their wives (e.g., by beating) in \nthe 1650s, but women were burned for killing their husbands, a crime \ndefined as "petty treason." 29 \n\nA self-perpetuating belief in woman\'s inferior intellect was fostered \nby the almost universal custom of keeping women out of schools, all \nbut a few aristocratic ladies who could receive an expensive private \neducation. Queen Elizabeth I of England was unsexed by several \nhistorians who thought she was too clever to be female. They claimed \nshe died in infancy, and a boy was secretly raised in her place. The \nsmall minority of educated women were seldom accepted as such. On \none occasion a learned lady was presented as a curiosity to King \nJames I, and he was told she was fluent in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. \nHe only inquired, "But can she spin?" 30 \n\nThe church controlled most schools, and the church would have \nno truck with women unless it was unavoidable. St. Columkille made \na rule that no woman could even be buried in the vicinity of a Christian \nchurch, alleging that this was the custom from Christianity\'s begin- \nnings. County Tyrone in Ireland still has a Reh\'g-na-man, "cemetery of \nwomen," located a half-mile from the church where only men were \nburied in the churchyard. 31 Some churchmen opined that women \ndidn\'t even have any souls to save. Ockham claimed women did have \nsouls, and on that account should be allowed to vote in church councils. \nThe pope instantly condemned this as heresy. 32 \n\nJosephine K. Henry castigated the churches for their consistently \nantifemale attitudes over the centuries: \n\nHas the Church ever issued an edict that women must be equal with man \nbefore the canon or the civil law, that her thoughts should be incorpo- \nrated in creed or code, that she should own her own body and property in \nmarriage, or have a legal claim to her children born in wedlock, which \nChristianity claims is a "sacrament" and one of the "holy mysteries"!\' . . . \nNo institution in modern civilization is so tyrannical and so unjust to \nwoman as is the Christian Church. It demands everything from her and \ngives her nothing in return. The history of the Church does not \n\ncontain a single suggestion for the equality of woman Through \n\ntyranny and falsehood alone is Christianity able to hold woman in \nsubjection. n \n\n\n\n924 \n\n\n\nIndeed, women were better served by pre-Christian laws nearly Sexism \n\neverywhere. Under the ancient Byzantine code, inheritance laws made \n\nno distinction between heirs on the basis of their sex; and although ^^^^^^^^^i \n\nadulterous men were executed, adulterous women were not. 54 After \ncenturies of Christian revision, the laws freely allowed men to \ncommit adultery, though their wives could be imprisoned or beaten to \ndeath for it. Until 1857, no English woman could obtain a divorce on \nany grounds without a special Act of Parliament, which meant only \nupper-class women with plenty of political leverage could even hope \nfor a divorce. 35 \n\nIn 1835, a Mrs. Caroline Norton left her husband after he \nrepeatedly subjected her to beatings, mental abuse, and infidelity. He \nkept his mistress in the same house with her. A court ruled that the wife \nneed not return to the house, but the husband was given their three \nchildren because the wife had "condoned his actions" by staying with \nhim through all his cruelties. In 1839, the Infants\' Custody Act \nintroduced a slight modification. At his own discretion, a judge in equity \ncould allow separated mothers to keep children under seven years of \nage, or to have visiting rights to older children, provided the mother was \nnot guilty of adultery. 36 Fathers suffered no such restriction, of \ncourse. \n\nWomen who refused to submit to the "discipline" of marriage, but \ninstead played the dangerous game of promising without delivering, \nwere known as jilts. Such women aroused the most violent outbursts of \nsexist sentiment, according to an old pamphlet: \n\nTheir tricks and devices are numberless, and not to be paralleled by any \nthing but their Ingratitude and Inhumanity; there indeed they exceed \nthemselves; nothing in Nature being so perfectly brutish and cruel as one \nof these kind [sic] of Creatures ... a Vermin so ravenous and mali- \ncious, and withal so subtle and designing, so formally chaste and \nhypocritically virtuous, and yet so scandalously common and impu- \ndently lewd, so proud, and yet so mercenary, and above all, so insolently ill \nnatured, that in the short character of a Jilt, are comprehended all the \nVices, Follies and Impertinences of the whole Sex. . . . In short, I cannot \nbut fancy them a Colony of Hell-Cats, planted here by the Devil, as a \nmischief to Mankind. 37 \n\nNoting that women often refused to play fair in the game for \nwhich men made all the rules, even Freud failed to transcend the sexist \nattitudes of his time. He wrote: "One cannot resist the thought that \nthe level of normal morality is different for women. Their superego \nnever becomes so unshakeable, so impersonal, so independent of its \naffective origins, as we demand it of a man. Critics since time immemo- \nrial have reproached women of certain character traits: that they \nexhibit less of a sense of justice than men do; that they are less prepared \nto submit to the great necessities of life." Since Freud regarded male \ndomination as one of the great necessities of life, he should hardly have \nbeen surprised to find women resisting it. Simone de Beauvoir said \n\n\n\n925 \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nChristine Pierce \n\nContemporary Ameri- \ncan feminist, \nprofessor of law and \nphilosophy at Har- \nvard and New York \nState University. \n\n\n\nevery woman knows that "masculine morality, as it concerns her, is a \nvast hoax. Man pompously thunders forth his code of virtue and \nhonor; but in secret he invites her to disobey it, and he even counts on \nher disobedience; without it, all that splendid facade behind which he \ntakes cover would collapse." 38 \n\nSince women weren\'t told the rules of the game, many of them \nbecame losers while they were still too young to figure it out for \nthemselves. Commenting on Oscar Wilde\'s homosexuality trial, W.T. \nStead remarked, "If Oscar Wilde, instead of indulging in dirty tricks \nof indecent familiarity with boys and men, had ruined the lives of half a \ndozen innocent simpletons of girls, or had broken up the home of his \nfriend by corrupting his friend\'s wife, no one could have laid a finger on \nhim. The male is sacrosanct: the female is fair game." 59 \n\nThough women were scorned for being "simpletons," they were \neven more violently scorned when they tried to develop their minds. \nFlorence Nightingale\'s popularity inspired many women to seek educa- \ntions in medicine, but male students ganged up on them. In 1870 a \ngroup of student doctors formed lines to prevent five women from \nentering classes in Surgeons\' Hall in London. Medical examiners \ntried to embarrass female students with indecent questions. When \nwomen received high marks in examinations, they were passed over, \nand scholarships were awarded to the men immediately below their \nlevel. \n\nIt was the same in other professions. In 1879, Birmingham \nschoolmasters barred women from employment as teachers of small \nboys, on the ground that it would encourage "immorality." Lawyers \ndenied women admission to the Inns of Court. Determined feminist \nefforts brought about admission of some women to classes at Queen\'s \nCollege in 1 848; but the Bishop of London excluded women from \nWheatstone\'s classes on electricity, because they had "congregated too \nabundantly" in Sir Charles Lyell\'s geology classes, keeping more \ndeserving students (i.e., men) from finding places in the classroom. In \nthe field of religion, the Church of England found it "unthinkable" \nthat women should ever be admitted to the ministry. 40 \n\nThe basic fallacy of sexism in employment or education was \npointed out by Christine Pierce: "We need not fear that women will \ndo what they cannot do." 41 If women were really unable to learn \nmedicine, law, theology, science, or any other field of endeavor, it \nwould hardly have been necessary for men to exert such efforts to keep \nthem from learning. The theory of feminine intellectual inferiority \nbegan to recede from view when women managed to receive education. \nBut many men still clung to the belief that women must be less able \nto think than men. \n\nIn 1913 T.E. Reed wrote a book called Sex, Its Origin and \nDetermination, to prove "scientifically" that women were biological- \nly inferior to men. The author said coitus during an incoming tide \nalways conceived boys, while coitus during an outgoing tide con- \n\n\n\n926 \n\n\n\nceived girls proving that the female was weaker, born of "waning" \nenergy. Despite the fact that incoming and outgoing tides differed on \nevery one of the world\'s coastlines, and infants conceived inland \ncouldn\'t be identified with any tide, the theory proved popular. 42 \n\nIn many ways, sexist thinkers have tried to pretend male domi- \nnance is "natural" or is a divinely ordained biological mandate. Yet as \nother mammalian species demonstrate, such an arrangement could \nserve no biological purpose. \n\nAny animal species in which males were biologically programmed \nto attack and injure the females would be at a disadvantage in terms \nof species survival, since mammalian young can\'t grow to maturity \nwithout healthy, competent mothers. 43 Thus it is found that, in most \nspecies, males are biologically inhibited from attacking females, even \nunder strong provocation. And the one virtually unbreakable male \nanimal taboo is any kind of interference between a female and the \nyoung she protects. \n\nKaren Homey suggested that men\'s antagonism may have devel- \noped as a result of sexual envy: "The male is sexually dependent on \nthe female to a higher degree than the woman is on him, because in \nwomen part of the sexual energy is linked to generative processes. \nCould it be that men, therefore, have a vital interest in keeping women \ndependent on them? M44 Judith Antonelli says, "Patriarchy is based \non the \'phallacy\' that the male is creator. Man\'s original awe and envy \nof woman becomes, under patriarchy, resentment and hostility. The \nonly way man can possess female power is through woman, and so he \ncolonizes her, suppressing her sexuality so that it serves him rather \nthan being the source of her power. . . . Patriarchy is indeed a male \n\n\n\nShadow \n\n\n\nneurosis. \n\n\n\n1. Evans, N.H.N., 180. 2. de Riencourt, 227. 3.Rees,227. 4. Shumaker,95. \n\n5.Bullough,98, 187,203. 6. Stanton, 194. 7.

Pagan Europe generally described the ghosts of ancestors as \nblack, like shadows, and desirous of blood, the elixir of rebirth. \n\nThe shadow was a vulnerable soul because it was external and had \nto be carefully preserved from accident. Many superstitious people \n\n\n\nKaren Horney, nee \n\nDanielsen (1885-1952) \nU.S. psychoanalyst \nand teacher, Freudian- \ntrained but breaking \naway from Freudian \nthought in many re- \nspects; author of The \nNeurotic Personality \nof Our Time (1937), \nOur Inner Conflicts \n(1945), Neurosis and \nHuman Growth \n(1950), etc. \n\n\n\n927 \n\n\n\nShaharit \n\n\n\nPausanias Creek \ntraveler and geographer \nof the 2nd century \na.d. Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the an- \ncient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\neven today think it dangerous to let their shadows fall across an open \ngrave, rocky cleft, or swift stream. 1 \n\nThe Bible shows Joshua and Caleb placing a death-curse on their \nenemies by saying "Their shadow is departed from them" (Numbers \n14:9). This was a typical "doom-saying," supposedly a prophecy to be \nfulfilled by its very utterance. \n\nOne could also give one\'s soul to a god by dedicating one\'s shadow \nto him. Pausanias said human bodies lost their shadows in the sanc- \ntuary of Zeus Lycaeus (Wolfish Zeus). 2 From such beliefs descended \nthe shadowless "werewolf" or vampire of medieval superstition. \nSoullessness was indicated by lack of a shadow or a reflection, both of \nwhich were anciently identified with souls. \n\nLike those who pretended to give their shadows to the ancient \ngods, those who gave their souls to the devil could be distinguished by \nlack of a shadow, according to medieval superstition. The most famous \nshadowless man in Jewish folklore was Peter Schlemihl, whose name \nbecame a byword for a fool because the devil tricked him into parting \nwith his shadow. 3 He was apparently based on the biblical patriarch \nShelumiel, whose name meant "friend of God," possibly because he \ngave God his shadow-soul. In Bohemia, Peter Schlemihl was known \nas Prschemischl, a hero mated to the legendary Queen Libussa. This \nmay have been a garbled recollection of the sacred marriage of Pater \nLiber and the Goddess Libera. 4 \n\nAnother version of Pater-Peter and his shadow-soul appeared in \nActs 5:15-16. People troubled by sickness or demonic possession \nwere brought into a street where the shadow of St. Peter passing by \n"might overshadow some of them"; and with this kind of soul-contact \n"they were healed every one." \n\nIn the pagan context, a shadowless man was not a demon, a \nwerewolf, or a "Schlemihl" but one whose soul had gone into eternal \nbliss. Plutarch said at the end of the world, the blessed ones would be \nhappy forever "in a state neither needing food nor casting a \nshadow." 5 \n\nOn earth, however, a shadowless state was to be feared. Jews lived \nin terror of the "noonday devil" (Keteb), a stealer of shadows. It \nmade the shadow-soul small and weak at noonday, leaving the owner \nvulnerable to demons of disease. 6 This shadow-stealing devil also \nentered into Christian superstition as the demonium meridianum \n(noonday devil). \n\nl.Frazer,G.B.,575. 2. d\'Alvidla, 64. 3.

See Lucifer. \n\n\n\n928 \n\n\n\nShakta Shakta \n\nA male worshipper of the Tantric image of the Great Goddess, \n\nShakti; a man versed in the techniques of Tantric yoga and identified ^i \n\nwith the Goddess herself through sexual union with her earthly \n\nrepresentative. A shakta was also known as a sadhaka or sadhu, possible \n\norigin of the "Sadducees" mentioned in the Bible. See Tantrism. \n\n\n\nShakti \n\nTantric title of the Great Goddess ( Kali Ma), realized both as a \nsexual partner and as the innermost, animating soul of man or god, like \nthe Greek Psyche, Roman Anima, Gnostic Sophia, Cabalistic She- \nkina, all based on the Shakti. Jung said she was the figure known as My \nLady Soul: "Every mother and every beloved is forced to become the \ncarrier and embodiment of this omnipresent and ageless image, which \ncorresponds to the deepest reality in a man." \' \n\nShakti is translated "Cosmic Energy." She implies "power, ability, \ncapacity, faculty, strength, prowess; regal power; the power of com- \nposition, poetic power, genius; the power or signification of a word or \nterm; the power inherent in cause to produce its necessary effect. . . . \n[S]hakti\'\\s the female organ; shakti is the active power of a deity and is \nregarded, mythologically, as his goddess-consort and queen." 2 Every \ngod needed his Shakti, or he was helpless to act. The Tantras say "the \nfemale principle antedates and includes the male principle, and . . . \nthis female principle is the supreme Divinity." ? \n\nTantric doctrine said mortal women are "life itself," and Goddess- \nlike, because they embody the principle of Shakti. The sages "hold \nwomen in great esteem and call them Shaktis and to ill-treat a Shakti, \nthat is, a woman, is a crime." A Tantric synonym for "woman" was \nShaktiman, "Mind of Shakti" or "Possessor of Shakti." 4 \n\nA Shakti was also a spirit-wife, or female guardian angel, who \ncould be incarnate in the earthly wife or mistress, or a wholly \nsupernatural figure. "An important division of the \'mythology of wom- \nan\' is devoted to showing that it is always a feminine being who helps \nthe hero to conquer immortality or to emerge victorious from his \ninitiatory ordeals. . . . Every Teleut shaman has a celestial wife who \nlives in the seventh heaven, where he meets her and makes love to her \nduring his ecstatic journeys." 5 \n\nFinal union with the Shakti occurred at the moment of death, \naccording to Tantric mystics. She was both the individual and the \ncosmic Goddess, absorbing the soul and body of the dying sage into \nherself, an experience of unsurpassable bliss on his part. "The \npossession of her, the cosmic Shakti, the living embodiment of the \nprinciple of beauty and youth eternal, is the ultimate quest, the very \nhighest prize." 6 \n\nThe Kulacudamani Nigama said not even God could become the \n\n\n\n929 \n\n\n\nShalirrur \nShamrock \n\n\n\nLalita Sahasrana- \n\nmamOneof the \nTantric texts in \npraise of the Goddess \nKali-Shakti. \n\n\n\nAvesta Early scrip- \ntures of Zoroastrianism, \nwritten in Avestan, \nan ancient Iranian lan- \nguage; still used by \nthe Parsees as a Bible \nand prayer book. \n\n\n\nsupreme Lord unless Shakti entered into him. All things arose from \ntheir union, but she said, "There is none but Myself Who is the Mother \nto create." The Lalita Sahasranamam said "The series of universes \nappear and disappear with the opening and shutting of Her eyes." As \nthe god required her power before he could do anything at all, so her \nworshipper on earth required the power of his own Istadevata, Shakti or \nlady-love. 7 \n\nThe same system was followed by Middle-Eastern mystics like the \nSufis, who deemed the mystic lady-love or fravashi essential to any \nman\'s enlightenment. Early Christian Gnostics also worshipped Shakti \nunder such names as Sophia, Pneuma, Eide, or Anima. Gnostic \nwritings show that post-mortem union with one\'s own soul was per- \nceived in sexual symbolism, as in the Mandaean Liturgies for the \nDead: the soul or "image" (Eide) embraces and caresses the dead man \nlike a beloved woman. This Tantric idea came into the west by way \nof the Avesta doctrine that, after the death of a believer, his own \nconscience would welcome him "in the form of a fair maiden." 8 \n\n1.

However, \nthe Irish were worshipping this emblem of their Triple Goddess long \nbefore Christianity appeared in their land. It stood for her triple \n"door," and her God sometimes bore the title of Trefuilngid Tre- \n\n\n\n930 \n\n\n\neochair, "Triple Bearer of the Triple Key," a trident representing the \ntriple phallus. He was known as a God of the Shamrock, partially \nassimilated to Christianity by a legend that he appeared to the Irish on \nthe day of Christ\'s crucifixion, bearing sacred stone tablets and a branch \nwith three fruits. 2 \n\n1.

Sheba, Shebat \n\n\n\nSheila-na-gig \n\nCarved representation of a naked woman squatting with her knees \napart, displaying her vulva, shown as a vesica piscis or double-pointed \noval. Sometimes the figure presented the vesica with both hands or \ndrew it open with one. Sheila-na-gig figures appeared all over old Irish \nchurches built before the 16th century. 1 Many were still in place \nduring the 19th century, but Victorian prudery defaced or destroyed \nlarge numbers of them. Some have been found buried near the \nchurches they once embellished. 2 \n\nSheila-na-gig figures closely resembled the yonic statues of Kali \nwhich still appear at the doorways of Hindu temples, where visitors \nlick a finger and touch the yoni "for luck." Some of the older figures \nhave deep holes worn in their yonis from much touching. 3 \n\nThe protruding ribcage on many examples of the sheila-na-gig \nimitates the figures of Kali as the death-goddess, Kalika, evidently \nremembered in Ireland as the Caillech or "Old Woman," who was also \nthe Creatress and gave birth to all races of men. 4 Celts generally \nprotected doorways with some female-genital fetish, which is why they \nsettled on the horseshoe, classic Omega-sign of the Kalika. In India it \nstood for the feminine cosmos within which Shiva ever performed his \ncreative sexual dance, although he was assimilated to the Kalika and \ngiven her title of Destroyer. 5 \n\nDerivation of the term sheila-na-gig is obscure. It meant some- \nthing like "vulva-woman." Gig or giggie meant female genitals and \nmay have been related to the Irish "jig," from French gigue, in \n\n\n\n931 \n\n\n\nShekina pre-Christian times an orgiastic dance. In ancient Erech a gig seems to \n\nShfol have been a holy yoni; the sacred harlots of the temple were known \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ as nu-gig. 6 \n\nI F Huxley, 63. 2. G.R. Scott, 239-43. 3.

Cabalists said it \nwas God\'s loss of his Shekina that brought about all evils. The \nHebrew Sh\'kina meant "dwelling-place," a hint that God had no \n"home" without her. Like her Tantric counterpart the Shakti, the \nSh\'kina was the source of all "soul" in the universe. Gnostic Christians \nof the 4th century spoke of the Sh\'kina as a "spirit of glory" in whom \nBeings of Light lived, as children in their mother\'s body or house. Mani \nreferred to the Aeons as sh\'kinas, or female spirits of the sacred year. 1 \n\nCabalists taught that it was essential to bring male and female \ncosmic principles together again, which might be done by sexual \nmagic, signifying union of the sun (man) and moon (woman). This was \ngraphically expressed by the hexagram. Philosophy of the Cabala \nsaid the supernal mother Shekina is manifested in the earthly mother, \nwith whom her husband should lie on the Sabbath, because "all the \nsix days of the week derive their blessing" from this coupling. Rabbi \nEliahu di Vidas said, "Who has not experienced the force of \npassionate love for a woman will never attain to the love of God." 2 \n\nJewish mystics said the "outer garment" of the Shekina is Torah, \n"Holy Law." A man became a Bridegroom of Torah by study, \nsymbolized in erotic imagery. He must court her like a beautiful \nmaiden. "She begins from behind a curtain to speak words in keeping \nwith his understanding, until very slowly insight comes to him." The \nShekina as "Indwelling One" might be compared to the Latin I-dea, \nor Goddess Within. "She opens the door of her hidden chamber ever so \nlittle, and for a moment reveals her face to her lover, but hides it \n\nagain forthwith He alone sees it and he is drawn to her with his \n\nheart and soul and his whole being." 3 \n\nAs a man required his Shekina for enlightenment, so God required \nhis Shekina for wisdom and creativity. This crucial tenet of cabalistic \ndoctrine is seldom emphasized or even mentioned today. \n\n1. Jonas, 218, 98. 2. Lederer, 187. 3.

Sacred kings who died on trees went \nto this other world. The Markandeya Purana mentioned an under- \nground realm where men\'s souls were impaled on trees. 2 \n\nShal-Mari probably became Sheol-Mari in the Middle East, where \nMari was Ishtar, and there was a long tradition of hanging human \nsacrifices on trees. \n\n1.

At Eleusis, the central Mystery \nwas "an ear of corn reaped in silence." J \n\nOld Testament writers supposed that the shibboleth was Astarte\'s \ndying-and-reborn god Baal. Shibboleth was used as a password \nbecause some tribes couldn\'t pronounce it (Judges 12:6). Patriarchal \nopposition to the symbol later made it synonymous with a false deity, \na meaning that remained up to the present time. \n\nl.d\'Alviella, 2. \n\n\n\nShin-Mu \n\n"Mother of Perfect Intelligence," China\'s Holy Virgin, who miracu- \nlously conceived her firstborn son, a Savior and spirit of the grain. Her \ninfant "came like a lamb, with no bursting or rending, with no hurt or \nharm," and was tenderly adored by sheep and oxen. 1 \n\nAfter producing this child, Shin-Mu resumed her archaic Great \nMother character and gave birth to 33,333 creatures. Patriarchal \nmyths deprived her of a vagina, and so insisted all these creatures were \nborn from her arms or breast. A Christian traveler in China explained \nShin-Mu\'s miraculous motherhood: she had "no place on her body \nwhence to bring them forth as other women of the world, whom for \nsin God hath subjected to filthiness of corruption, to show how filthy \nsin is." 2 \n\nAfter she was virginized and even deprived of a vagina, Shin-Mu\'s \nonly remaining connection with sexuality was similar to the virgin \nMary\'s: she continued to be the divine patroness of whores. 3 \n\nPersians diabolized her and called her Shimnu, the "Great Devil," \nso called in a Manichean Confession-Prayer found at Turfan and in \nthe Cave of a Thousand Buddhas, at Tun-huang. 4 \n\n1.

Both "navel" and "naval" once referred to the \nburial shrine likened to a ship and the Mother\'s womb at the same \ntime. The Norse death ship vessel of the famous "Viking funeral" \nwas called ludr, meaning boat, coffin, and cradle. 3 It took the dead \nback to their Mother-sea; the Norsemen\'s expression for "death" was \n"to return to the mother\'s womb." 4 The pagan Welsh similarly sent \ntheir dead back to the marine womb and called their funeral dirges \nmarwysgafen, "Giving-back-to-the-Sea-Mother." 5 The vessel of \ndeath and rebirth was always feminine, which may be why a ship is still \n"she." \n\nEgypt\'s Lord of Death, Osiris-Seker, was carried away in a boat \nunder the auspices of a priest entitled "great chief of the hammer," \nthe same title held by Thor. The god came to life again in the "morning \nboat," tended by a spirit named Matet, evidently the same as Mater \nMatuta, the Dawn-Mother. 6 Matet was an emanation of Isis the \nMother, to whom the solar boat was dedicated. \n\nRomans worshipped Isis as a ship-goddess, the boat being a symbol \nof her womb, each of her temples having a "bark of Isis" carved in \nstone at the entrance. The Roman temple where Isis\'s holy boat was \nkept became a Christian church under the name of Santa Maria della \nNavicella: Our Lady of the Boat. 7 Isis-figures in boats, kept in pagan \ntemples throughout Europe, gave rise to the curious fairy tale \ncollected by Grimm under the title of "The Witch in the Stone Boat." \n\nMany "witches" or Goddess-figures appeared in boats even during| \nthe nominally Christian era. A 1 2th-century chronicler spoke of \nsinging, dancing processions that followed sacred ships mounted on \nwheels, containing as he put it "I know not what evil genius." 8 One \nsuspects the chronicler knew perfectly well that the wheeled ship \ncontained a pagan Goddess. Up to the late Middle Ages, the \nGoddess\'s wheeled ship was drawn through the streets of Flemish town* \nby the weavers\' guilds, accompanied by half-naked male and female \ndancers whose behavior, churchmen said, was "scandalously bacchana- \nlian." 9 The Midsummer festival at Douai in 1770 featured a huge \nWheel of Fortune, emblem of the Fate-goddess, and a dry-land ship \nfilled with people who made "strange gestures," recalling the images \nof ancestral spirits in the ship of Arianrhod which was also a star- \nwheel. 10 See Wheel. \n\nShips were associated with orgiastic rites from the earliest manifes- \ntations of the ship as a womb symbol and an earthly imitation of the \n\n\n\n934 \n\n\n\ncrescent moon. Oriental sages called the moon "the Ark or vessel of \nboat-like shape, symbol of fertility or the Container of the Germ of all \nlife." 11 \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 254-55. 2. Oxenstierna, 34. 3.

Like the Great Goddess whose \nson, lover, and victim he was, Shiva had many names. Sometimes he \nalone was a trinity, or a three-headed god, bearer of the trident or triple \nphallus which enabled him to mate with the Triple Mother. 1 \n\nShiva was "in a state of actualization because he is in bodily \ncontact with his own universal energy, the Shakti, the Goddess, the \nfeminine active principle, the efficient and material cause of the uni- \nverse, the Maya that evolves the differentiated elements and beings. \nSakala Shiva bears on his head the crescent of the moon." 2 \n\nShiva was called Lord of Yoga, i.e., of the "yoke" that bound him \nto the Goddess. He was also Lord of Death, called Shava, the \nCorpse, prostrate under the feet of Kali as she devoured his entrails a \nHindu parallel of the dead Osiris shown as the Still-Heart, a mummy, \ndead and yet alive. 3 \n\nAmong Shiva\'s many other titles were Great Lord, Lord of the \nDance, Lord of Cattle (Pasupati), Beneficent One (Sankara), Lord \nWho Is Half Woman (Ardhanarisvara), God with the Moon in His \nHair (Candrasekhara), He Who Belongs to the Triple Goddess, He \nWho Gives and Takes Away, Consort of the Goddess Uma, Con- \ndemned One, Destroyer, Howler. 4 \n\nTantric yogis insisted that their supreme Shiva was the only god, \nand all other gods were only inferior imitations of him. He was \ncertainly older than the Vedic heaven-gods. A deity like Shiva was \nshown under the feet of a Kali-like squatting Goddess on Sumerian \ncylinder seals of 2300 B.C. 5 Cultures of Sumeria and the Indus valley \nwere in contact at very early periods. Shiva\'s worshippers may have \nbeen literally correct in viewing other gods as recent upstarts. Some of \ntheir scriptures claimed that Brahma and Vishnu were so puny that \nthey couldn\'t even realize the limits of Shiva\'s cosmic lingam (phallus). 6 \n\nAs a sexual god, Shiva epitomized the Tantric ideal of maithuna, \ninsuring the orgasmic pleasure of his partner while controlling his \nown, to partake of her sexual energy. He advocated the female-superior \nposition also favored by such Middle-Eastern Goddesses as Hecate, \nLilith, and Asherah the position usually forbidden by patriarchs. 7 The \nBrahmana Purana said the female-superior position was a "reversal" \n\n\n\nPuranas are \nancient Sanskrit \nscriptures in verse, \ntreating of cosmologies, \nsacred histories, and the \nnature of the divine. \n\n\n\n935 \n\n\n\nSkkfurttu Gautama \n\n\n\npracticed by Shiva and lusted after by the "daughters of the sages" of \nold; but proper Brahmans must regard it as a perversion. 8 \n\nVedic myths portray hostility between Brahma and Shiva, even \nthough the two were eventually regarded as components of the same \ntrinity. Shiva\'s priests claimed that Brahmadeva (Brahma-god) was \nnothing more than a servant of Shiva under his archaic name of \nRudra Mokshakala, "Liberated Black Rudra." Brahmans retaliated by \nbelittling Shiva as "an evil yogi," whose cult was only "worship of the \nlingam"; if Brahma was Shiva\'s servant, at least the servant didn\'t take \nup the same "self-indulgence" or "hideous activities" as the master. \nLike western underground gods, Shiva was easily diabolized because he \nwas already the Great Black One (Mahakala), confused with Yama \nand Ganesha, the Lord of Hosts, who begot his reincarnations on \nMaya-Kali. 9 \n\nAs Lord of the Dance, Shiva represented one of Hinduism\'s most \nsubtle concepts. He copied Kali\'s Dance of Life, supposedly directing \nand controlling by its rhythm the constant movement in time and space \nof all material things. Shiva performed this dance in a place called \nChidambaram, the "Center of the Universe"; but the location of this \nplace is within the human heart. 10 The sages\' implications were that \n(1) the heartbeat is the basic rhythm to which all human music is \nrelated, because it is heard even by the unborn infant in the paradise- \nstate of intrauterine life, and it is never forgotten; and (2) each human \nbeing secretly regards his own heart as the center of the universe \nindeed, therefore the god is located within the core of man\'s own self. \n\nShiva was seldom depicted alone, for his power depended on his \nunion with Kali, his feminine energy, without whom he could not \nact. The puzzling vision of Shiva as Shava the Corpse, under the \nGoddess\'s feet, illustrated the "doctrine that Shiva without his Shakti \ncan do and is, so far as the manifested is concerned, nothing." Yet \njoined to the Goddess, he became the Bindu or spark of creation. \nEvery human orgasm was believed to share in this creative experience \nas "an infinitesimally small fragment and faint reflection of the \ncreative act in which Shiva and Shakti join to produce the Bindu which \nis the seed of the universe." n A Tantric yogi in sexual union with his \nyogini or Shakti could attain the experience of yoga, "linking" himself \nwith godhood, and in his ecstasy exclaim Shivaham "I Am \nShiva." 12 \n\n1.

The queen died in giving birth to \nSiegfried, who was set afloat on the river in a vessel of glass and taken \nashore by a doe, who nursed him until he was found by the smith \nMimir, who raised him. According to another story, Siegfried was \nnursed by a she-wolf, and his early name was Wolfdietrich. 1 \n\nSiegfried\'s later adventures are the subject matter of the Nibelung- \nenlied and other epic romances: how he slew the dragon Fafnir and \nmarried Brunnhilde ("Burning Hel"), and was slain in a typical Liebes- \ntod (Love-Death) after which he was reunited with his mystic bride. \nHe was a Germanic Heracles, with many elements of the sun-hero. \n\n1.

Out of her was born the first Word; this was the \nLogos of creation. Like Mother Night, she stood at the beginning of \nall things and represented the state of chaos or nonexistence before the \nuniverse took form. See Sophia, Saint. \n\n\n\nClementine Homi- \nlies Greek writings \nfalsely attributed to a \nfirst-century bishop of \nRome; actually com- \nposed by an anonymous \nChristian apologist \ntoward the end of the \n4th century. \n\n\n\nSimon Magus \n\n"Simon the Mage" was one of the principal rivals of the Christians\' \ncult-hero in the first century a.d. The Clementine Homilies said Simon \nwas one of the Essenes, and a disciple of John the Baptist, and the \nfounder of Gnostic Christianity. Simon was said to have appeared in \nSamaria as God the Father, in Palestine as the Son, and in the rest of \nthe nations as the Holy Spirit. He was even canonized, in the guise of a \n"St. Simon" allegedly chosen "bishop of Jerusalem" in 62 a.d., after \nleading a group of Essenic eremites in the village of Pella, beyond \nJordan. Followers of Simon were still numerous in the 4th century \n\nA.D.\' \n\nFrom the orthodox viewpoint, the trouble with Simon was that his \nsect welcomed women and held that the world-creating power was as \nmuch female as male. Simon\'s heaven was sevenfold, after the classic \npattern, and ruled by three pairs of male-and-female Powers, Roots, \nor Aeons, all born of a great female source with the power of concep- \ntion, the origin of all things. Simon said God the Father came out of \nher, and was not called Father until she had named him Father. 2 \n\nSimon traveled with a sacred harlot named Helen, whom he called \nhis First Thought (Ennoia). She was a reincarnation of Helen of \nTroy, Inanna, Athene, and other Goddesses. Simon claimed that, with \nher, in his former god-incarnation he had created the world. Simon- \nians worshipped her as Sophia, the Gnostic Virgin of Light, and insisted \nthat she had mothered Jesus. As a Holy Whore (Prunikos), she \nrepresented the fallen Ennoia for whose sake God descended and \nclothed himself in flesh, in the person of Simon. "World salvation \nwas bound up with her redemption by him." 3 \n\nSimonians said those who placed their faith in Simon and Helen \nwould be saved by this grace, without need of works. The relationship \nbetween Simon and Helen was like that of the Gnostic Christ and his \nsacred harlot Mary Magdalene, who was similarly called Pistis- \nSophia-Prunikos (Faith- Wisdom- Whore). She embodied Sophia, who \nwas Jesus\'s spouse in heaven. 4 Gnostic Gospels said Jesus gave the \nmystic secret of the keys to the kingdom of heaven not to Peter, but to \nMary; and Peter reacted with jealousy and hostility toward Mary and \nall women. 5 \n\nPeter was also hostile toward Simon Magus. According to the Acts \n\n\n\n938 \n\n\n\nof the Apostles, Peter rebuked Simon for trying to buy the apostles\' Simon Magus \n\nsecret of "laying on of hands" to cure diseases and cast out devils (Acts \n\n8:18). From this biblical tale came the term simony buying and ^^i^ \n\nselling priestly benefices and powers a sin to which the medieval heirs \n\nof "Peter" were especially prone. The author or authors of Acts had \n\nno good to say of Simon, who was called a false prophet, one who \n\n"bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some \n\ngreat one: to whom they all gave heed . . . saying, This man is the great \n\npower of God" (Acts 8:9-10). \n\nLike Peter, Simon was supposed to have visited Rome and \nimpressed the crowned heads with his miracles. Christians invented a \nstory about Simon to explain the inscription on a statue of the old \nSabine god Semo Sancus. The inscription was Semoni deo sancto, \nwhich some semiliterate "authority" rendered The Holy God Simon, \nclaiming that the statue was raised by Nero in honor of Simon \nMagus, after Simon allowed himself to be beheaded by Nero\'s execu- \ntioner. Then, by magic art, he substituted a ram for himself, and on \nthe third day rose from the dead before Nero, after the manner of all \nsavior-gods. 6 \n\nThe Acts of Peter and Paul asserted that Simon flew over the \nCampus Martius in a chariot drawn by winged demons. In the midst \nof his triumph, his enemy Peter recited a magic formula that caused him \nto fall and break his neck. 7 During the 8th century, Pope Paul I built \na church "on the exact spot" where Simon Magus fell to his death the \nexact spot having been discovered through a private revelation from \nthe Holy Ghost. In 850, Pope Leo IV reconstructed this church and \nnamed it Santa Maria Nova the New Holy Mary. \n\nAfter his death, Simon was succeeded by another Gnostic hero, \nMenander, "Moon-man." 8 This seems to have been a reincarnated \nSimon, assimilated to the moon. The rivalry between Peter and Simon- \nMenander suggests the battles between those Christians who \nworshipped the Essenic sun god whose priests were Pater, Petra, or \nPeter and those who worshipped the lunar hero. The controversy \nsuggests a schismatic breaking away from a parent cult: it must be \nremembered that Peter\'s name was Simon before Jesus changed it to \nPeter (Matthew 10:2), and that Peter too was a "Mage." \n\nThe Magi discovered the advent of Jesus by astrological magic, \naccording to the Christian story; this was put forth as one of the \nproofs of Jesus\'s divinity. Therefore, Christians were reluctant to dis- \ncredit any of the Magi. In Simon\'s case however, the early fathers \nwere implacably opposed to the main feature of his doctrine: "the \nearthly incarnation of the heavenly mother. . . . Leaders of the ortho- \ndox Church fought from the very beginning of Christianity against such \nglorification of women." 9 Writings attributed to Simon made exten- \nsive use of feminine symbols: paradise was the womb, Eden the \nplacenta. "The river that flows forth from Eden symbolizes the navel, \n\n\n\n939 \n\n\n\nSin \n\nSirens \n\n\n\nwhich nourishes the fetus [T]he Exodus, consequently, signifies the \n\npassage out of the womb, and . . . \'the crossing of the Red Sea refers \nto the blood.\' " 10 Such feminine imagery linked Simon with priests of \nthe Old Religion. In Ireland he was known as Simon the Druid. 11 \n\nThe Latin cognomen Faustus, "Favored One," was bestowed on \nSimon early in the Christian era. "The fact that he was accompanied \nby a Helena whom he claimed to be the reborn Helen of Troy shows \nclearly that we have here one of the sources of the Faust legend of \nthe early Renaissance. Surely few admirers of Marlowe\'s and Goethe\'s \nplays have an inkling that their hero is the descendant of a gnostic \nsectary, and that the beautiful Helen called up by his art was once the \nfallen Thought of God through whose raising mankind was to be \nsaved." 12 \n\n1.

A personification of the yoni, mated to the phallic "ram" ^^^^m \nwhose name meant "sexual enjoyment." See Furrow. \n\n\n\nSkadi var. Scatha, Scotia \n\nThe Celto-Teutonic Goddess in her "Destroyer" aspect. Like the \nGreek Persephone, "Destroyer," she was Queen of the Shades, Mother \nDeath. Her name was the root of Gothic skadus, Old English sceadu, \n"shadow, shade." She was the Shadow into which all the gods went at \ndoomsday, called Gotterdammerung, or Going-Into-the-Shadow-of- \nthe-Gods. 1 As Scotia, she was the Dark Goddess like Black Kali, the \nCaillech after whom Scotland was named. 2 \n\nLike Kali, Skadi had to be propitiated each year with an outpouring \nof male blood in primitive sacrificial rites. Her annual victim was \nassimilated to the god Loki, who became a "savior" by fertilizing Skadi \nwith his blood. Loki\'s genitals were attached by a rope to a goat, and a \ntug-of-war ensued, until Loki\'s flesh gave way and he fell into Skadi\'s \nlap, thus bathing her loins in his blood. The gods watched anxiously \nto see if Skadi smiled; and when she did, it means spring could return \nonce more to the land. 3 \n\nSimilar blood-rites were practiced all over the ancient world, when \nmen sought godhood by giving their blood to the Goddess, before \nanimal sacrifices replaced human ones, and even afterward. It was not \nuncommon for priestesses representing the Goddess to bathe in \nsacrificial blood, like the women who sacrificed Apis the bull-god in \nEgypt, hoisting their skirts as they dismembered him so his spurting \nblood would quicken their wombs. 4 Like many death-goddess figures, \nSkadi collected the penises of her castrated heroes, and in this \ncharacter she was named Mornir, "troll-woman." 5 \n\nRemnants of the bloody sacrifice of Loki and the goat could still be \nfound in Norway and Sweden in the late 1 7th century. Churchmen \nvainly denounced the masquerades, sexual promiscuity, and "goat \ngames" associated with Easter and other religious festivals. 6 \n\nSkadi was a dark twin of Freya, therefore virtually identical with \nthe underground Goddess Hel. She was once all the Earth, birth- \ngiver and devourer of her children. The entire land mass of Scandinavia \nwas named after her. Originally it was Scadin-auja, the land of Skadi. 7 \n\nA variation of her name, Skuld, was given to the third of the three \nFates, or Norns, in the role of destroying Crone. Naturally she \nbecame the patroness of witches, whose activities came to be called \n"skulduggery." \n\nTo the Celts, she was Scatha or Scath. Her underground realm of \nthe dead was "the Land of Scath." Like Persephone\'s underworld \n\n\n\n941 \n\n\n\nSkakJ within seven loops of the Styx, the Land of Scath was a city of seven \n\nSlavery walls. 8 It was variously located under the earth, or in heaven, or far \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ away over the sea on a western island, the land of "Sky." Cu Chulainn \nand other Celtic heroes learned magic skill in martial arts from a visit \nto Queen Scatha\'s island of Skye. She kept the hero for "a year and a \nday," the usual mythic image of the old 1 3-month lunar year with its \nintercalary day. When she had taught a man all she knew, she sent him \nback to earth a fey man, set apart and sacer, fated to do great deeds \nand die a sacrificial death. 9 The legend suggests that the real island of \nSkye was a cult center of the Goddess, and warriors went there to be \ninitiated into their heroic profession. \n\nSkadi is still invoked by place names in Sweden, such as Skadave \n(Skadi\'s temple) and Skadalungr (Skadi\'s grove). 10 \n\n1.

A great skald was believed to have words of \npower; what he sang or prophesied would come true. He was able to \naddress the death goddess herself, via funerary ballads, and appeal to her \nto treat the deceased well. Norse sagas and eddaic poetry were the \nwork of skalds who belonged to a priestly class, like druids. See \nRomance. \n\n\n\nSlavery \n\nThe de Paors wrote naively of the life of a slave in early Christian \nIreland: "Even if he was a slave he had the advantage of living in a \nsociety which had accepted the teachings of Christianity." \' This \nwasn\'t much of an advantage, considering that in pagan society he \nwould not have been a slave at all. The United States in the 19th \ncentury had also accepted the teachings of Christianity, but this was of \nlittle benefit to the slaves on southern plantations. \n\nIn effect, the feudalism upheld by the Christian churches was a \nslave state. Serfs were at the mercy of their overlords, who held the \npower of life and death over them. Serfs could be bought and sold with \nthe land. Though they were taxed to support the church and the \nnobility, they were without legal rights. The "teachings" of Christianity \npaid no attention to the plight of the serfs, nor did the churches make \nany effort to alleviate their sufferings. \n\nChurch fathers were even more concerned to keep women in a \nstate of subjection throughout all social strata, so that each male even \nat the slave level had at least one slave of his own: a wife. St. Augustine \n\n\n\n942 \n\n\n\nlid wives should be slaves to their husbands, and husbands had the Sleipnir \n\nright to beat and abuse them. To a wife who had been beaten he would Smashana-Kali \n\nsay, "It is the duty of servants to obey their masters. . . . [Y]ou have ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmade a contract of servitude." 2 St. Thomas Aquinas said a male slave \nwas superior to a wife, because a male slave was not in subjection \n"according to the law of nature," but a wife was "subject to the man on \naccount of the weakness of her nature, both of mind and body." 3 In \nother words, Aquinas believed that might makes right; weakness must be \ndominated by strength. Of course this was not always the rule in all- \nmale relationships, only in male-female ones. \n\nThe combination of slavery and sexism in Christian societies made \nthe lot of female slaves particularly onerous. They were completely \nhelpless in the hands of their masters, and could be raped, tortured, or \nmurdered with impunity. Even in "enlightened" 19th-century \nAmerica, female slaves were in a singularly unenviable position. \n\nDr. James Marion Sims, known as the American "father of \ngynecology," was famed as the inventor of a surgical technique for \ncuring vesicovaginal fistula. He also performed hundreds of clitoridecto- \nmies and ovariotomies to cure "sex-related diseases" in women. \nWhat is usually not told about his career is the way he developed his \ntechniques. Before the Civil War, he kept women slaves in a disused \njailhouse and made them his guinea pigs, performing hundreds of \nexperimental and exploratory operations on them until they died off \none by one and were replaced by fresh victims. 4 Sims\'s career and \nwritings bear out what some psychologists have suspected, that early \ngynecological surgeons were fundamentally women-haters with a sadis- \ntic bent. \n\nIn patriarchal societies, said Marx, "Woman\'s true qualities are \nwarped to her disadvantage, and all the moral and delicate elements \nin her nature become the means for enslaving her and making her \nsuffer." 5 \n\n1. de Paor, 100. 2.

Skalds called the gallows "high- \nchested rope-Sleipnir," carrying men to the land of death. The same \nword meant "gallows tree" and "horse" (drasil). 1 See Horse; Odin. \n\nl.Turville-Petre,48. \n\n\n\nSmashana-Kali \n\nKali Ma as the Goddess of cremation grounds and other places of \ndeath. The yantra (symbol) of Smashana-Kali was doubly yonic: an \n\n\n\n943 \n\n\n\nSmith \n\n\n\neight-petaled lotus with multiple repetitions of the inverted triangle \nthat meant "female genitals." 1 The meaning of the yantra of Smashana- \nKali was rebirth following death. Her priestesses, called dakinis, \narranged funerals and tended the dying. In the after-world they became \npsychopomps. \n\n1 . Muhnnirvunatantm, 360. \n\n\n\nSmith \n\nA recurrent story about Amazons was that they deliberately crippled \ncertain men, members of a special caste of metalworkers and smiths \nwhose deformity became their caste mark. The Amazonian smith- \ngod Hephaestus was lame. Some said he was lamed when Zeus cast him \ndown from heaven to the underworld for trying to defend his mother \nHera. Others said he was lamed by Hera herself. Hephaestus shared a \ntemple with Athene, renowned as an instructress of smiths. She \ntaught smithcraft to Daedalus, the builder of the Cretan Labyrinth. 1 \n\nMany myths point to a continuing relationship between smithcraft \nand the worship of the Goddess. Egyptian priests of Isis were mesniu, \n"smiths." 2 Aphrodite ruled the copper mines and metalworking schools \nof her sacred isle, Cyprus ("Copper"). Medieval alchemists contin- \nued to call copper the Metal of Venus. The lame smith Hephaestus also \nclaimed Aphrodite as his bride. The primal sea-goddesses loved him, \ndespite his deformity. "Golden women" helped him in his workshop on \nthe isle of Lemnos, traditional home of militant Amazons. 3 \n\nSmiths often claimed magic powers stemming from secret connec- \ntion with the feminine forces of nature. Roman faber meant both \n"smith" and "magician." Russian folk tales portrayed smiths as assistants \nof witches. Exorcisms attributed to St. Patrick claimed to avert the \nspells of "women, smiths, and druids." 4 The Yakuts said "Smiths and \nshamans are from the same nest," believing smiths could heal, \nprophesy, and work miracles. Secret societies linking metallurgy and \nmagic appear in the traditions of China and Japan, as in those of \nmedieval alchemists, craft fraternities, and German Mannerbunde. 5 \n\nThe German name Schmidt (Smith) once referred to a priestly \ncaste of metalworking shamans, who were also bards. Their apotheo- \nsized founder was Wayland the Smith in Scandinavia, Volund a \nconsort of the Triple Goddess. He encountered her in totemic form, \nas three doves flying above a sacred spring. 6 \n\nEnglish tradition said Wayland the Smith lived within the Berk- \nshire hill marked by the 370-foot image of the White Horse of \nUffington. If horses were brought to him at night and left, with money, \nat one of the standing stones, he would shoe them before the coming \nof the dawn. 7 \n\nMongols said the seven stars of Ursa Major which the Hindus \ncalled Seven Rishis were the skulls of seven smiths who had been \n\n\n\n944 \n\n\n\nraised to the sky by the Goddess. The constellation was a special patron Snake \n\nof smiths. 8 Christian folklore said the man in the moon was Cain, Sneeze \n\nwhose name meant "smith"; the Cainites or Kenites were the special ^^^-^^^^^^ \n\ncaste of metalworkers in ancient Palestine, until they were driven out \nof the country (1 Samuel 13:19). See Cain. \n\nThe Irish said the celestial smith was Luno (Moon-man), a lame \ncraftsman like Hephaestus. He made Fingal\'s magic sword. 9 Merlin \ntoo was a smith; he forged Arthur\'s magic armor. 10 Christian syncretism \neven represented the God who impregnated the virgin Mary as "the \nSmith from above" who threw his hammer into her breast probably a \nnew version of Thor, as an apotheosized Wayland. 11 \n\nWhen the old gods were made devils, smithcraft was associated \nwith devil\'s work. Numerous cathedral bells were said to have been \nforged by the devil. 12 The devil was also the Master Smith who forged \nthe original ironwork doors of Notre Dame de Paris, which were \nreplaced by new doors in I860. 13 \n\nGypsies were often described as smiths, and many adopted the \nsurname of Smith. 14 The prejudice against ironworkers included \ngypsies. This prejudice was particularly notable in Abyssinia where \nironworkers were restricted to a special caste, excluded from the rites \nof the church, and believed to possess the evil eye. 15 \n\nAlong with the smiths, other medieval European craft guilds were \nconsidered subversive by Christian orthodoxy. The guild of free \nmasons, for example, maintained their own ceremonies, secrets, and \nsemi-religious doctrine. "The Church, not without the semblance of \nreason, will regard the Masonic brotherhood as her most treacherous \nand dangerous enemy, which aims to dismantle her work and \nreconstruct it in another spirit." 16 The smiths\' guilds were even more \nsuspect at one time, to the point where the church even felt it \nnecessary to dissolve some of them. \n\n1.

The \nold expression was "Jupiter preserve you" or "Jupiter help me." \' Its \nbasis was the ancient Indo-European concept of the air-soul or breath- \nsoul (Atman), which might be expelled from the body by a violent \n\n\n\n945 \n\n\n\nSolomon and Sheba rush of air unless prevented by a verbal charm. Covering the mouth \n\nduring a yawn arose from the same fear of losing the soul. Medieval \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ churchmen accepted the superstition, and taught that both sneezing and \nyawning should be immediately protected by the sign of the cross, \nbecause "Ofttimes a man sneezed, and expired at the moment of \nsneezing. ... In like manner it often befell that a man yawned, and \nfell dead." 2 \n\nThe primitive idea of the air-soul was closely associated with \nsneezing by the Polynesians. The first man on earth was kneaded of \nred clay moistened with the deity\'s blood that is, the same combina- \ntion of menstrual blood and earth that ancient Semites called \nadamah and was animated by the deity\'s breath. Then the clay effigy \ncame to life and sneezed. The name of this first man was Tiki-ahua, \nor The Creator\'s Sneeze. Ahua, or "likeness," was a sound-word for \n"sneeze." 3 Thus the man made "in God\'s image" was the same as a \nman made "by God\'s sneeze." \n\nThe Christian custom of saying "God bless you" to a sneezer was \nmeant to serve as shorthand for extreme unction, in the event that \nthe soul happened to leave the body. Hindus still take similar precau- \ntions when someone yawns. They snap their fingers to frighten the \nsoul away from the open mouth and back down the throat where it \nbelongs. \n\n1. de Lys, 305. 2. de Voragine, 278. 3. Frazer, EOT., 5. \n\n\n\nSolomon and Sheba \n\nSolomon meant Sun God of On, the Jewish version of Ra of \nHeliopolis. 1 Solomon was the one Jewish king with pretensions to ruling \na Golden Age of glory. The wonders of his reign were attributed to \nhis wisdom, supposedly the gift of Yahweh, though the Bible inconsist- \nentfy declares that Solomon didn\'t worship Yahweh. Solomon\'s \nfamous temple was built not by himself but by King Hiram of Tyre, to \nwhom Solomon was forced to pay tribute (1 Kings 5:1 1). The deities \nworshipped in that temple were the Tyrian sun god Melek or Heracles- \nMelkart (biblical Molech); Shamash the sun god (biblical Chemosh); \nand the Goddess Astarte, or Ashtoreth, whom Yahweh\'s priests called \nan abomination (1 Kings 1 1:5-7). \n\nIn reality, there was no Golden Age of Solomon. No contempo- \nrary nation took any notice of Israel\'s alleged glory. The "great cities" \nSolomon was supposed to have built were small mud-hut villages. The \n"city" of Megiddo covered less than 13 acres. "The standard of living \nwas far from luxurious when compared to that prevailing in other parts \nof the ancient Near Eastern world." 2 \n\nSolomon\'s reign was set in the middle of the 10th century B.C., but \\ \nthe Hebrew manuscript used as a basis for the biblical account was \nwritten in the 10th century a.d., 2000 years later though a few early- \n\n\n\n946 \n\n\n\nmedieval copies of a Greek text might have gone as far back as the \nI 3rd century B.C. There were no records whatever traceable to Solo- \nmon\'s own time, not even the king lists that were customary in the \nI nations that amounted to anything. Like David, Solomon was arbitrarily \nassigned a reign of forty years because that was the traditional span of \n, a generation. 3 \n\nSolomon\'s reign and deeds must be interpreted as a collection of \nlegends from Egypt, Phoenicia, and especially from southern Arabia, \nthe land of Sheba, where a true Golden Age was flourishing under a \nsuccession of matriarchal queens. Sheba was the primary source of \nfrankincense and other valuable spices, in great demand not only for \nfood preservation but also for religious and funerary use. \n\nEutychius said the whole Sinai peninsula had been governed by \nwealthy Sheban queens for as long as anyone could remember. In the \nalleged time of Abraham, Queen Shabib (Sheba) had "built Nisib and \nEdessa and surrounded them with walls. She founded also the \nsanctuary of Harran, and made an idol of gold, called Sin." 4 This was \nthe Moon-god of Mount Sinai, the god of Moses. Semitic tribes of \nArabia worshipped the moon and her earthly embodiment, the queen, \nsince at least the 16th century B.C. 5 Sheba was the lunar queen\'s \ncapital, also known to the Egyptians as Punt or Ophir, famous as a land \nof fabulous wealth. 6 \n\nThere were king consorts in Sheba\'s capital city of Marib (Mar- \niaba), but they were forbidden to leave the queen\'s palace on pain of \ndeath by stoning. 7 The city, hub of the spice trade, had a great moon \ntemple at Almaqah, laid out in the feminine-symbolic oval character- \nistic of matriarchal religious centers. Priestesses of this temple appear in \nthe Old Testament as "Sabeans" (Shebans). They were described as \nholy harlots from the "wilderness," the biblical name for any place \noutside of Israel, having crowns on their heads and jeweled bracelets \non their arms (Ezekiel 23:42). Sheban priests were called mukarrib, \n"kindred of the moon," from which descended the Hebrew kerubh \n(cherub, angel) and the Arabic muqanibin, "close kindred," a title of \nmedieval Sufi mystics. 8 \n\nThe Bible presents a highly improbable picture of a rich Queen \nof Sheba coming with a caravan of spices, gold, and precious stones to \nvisit a king of poor, backward Israel. She loaded Solomon with gifts \nbecause she was so impressed by what he already owned and by his \nclever answers to her questions (1 Kings 10:5). Needless to say, this \nwas only mythic name-dropping. Solomon was placed on his throne and \ncrowned by a Sheban moon-priestess called Bath-Sheba (Daughter of \nSheba), said to be his mother (Song of Solomon 3:1 1). The king \nwhether his name was Solomon or not clearly lived in a more \ndependent relationship to the Sheban matriarchate than the account of \nthe queen\'s visit might suggest. \n\nAccording to the Koran, Solomon stole his throne from Balkis, \nQueen of Sheba. 9 The name Balkis, Bilqis, or Balqama is thought to \n\n\n\nSolomon and Sheba \n\n\n\nEutychius Greek \nhistorian, author of a se- \nries of Annals. \n\n\n\n947 \n\n\n\nSolomon and Sheba be related to Greek pallakis, "sacred harlot." The Marib temple was \nMahram Bilqis, Moon-Mother Bilqis, the formal name of the God- \n^^^^^^^^^^ dess-queen. Set in the doorway of the temple was a large bronze \n\nbaptismal basin filled with water, the prototype of the "brazen sea" in \nSolomon\'s temple, copied from Sheban antecedents. 10 This mighty \nwomb-symbol was decorated with the female yonic emblems of \nknops and lilies, also "cherubim," derived from the Sheban \nmukarribim. n \n\nSolomon\'s temple featured a pair of phallic pillars named Boaz \n(eagerness, strength) and Jachin (God makes him firm), surmounted \nby female symbols of lilies and pomegranates (1 Kings 7:19-20). By thi \nancient symbolism, the two pillars at the temple door represented the \nking and his tanist, both craving entrance into the Enclosed Garden or \ntemple-body of the Goddess. The hieros gamos between Solomon \nand his mysterious black queen a marriage arranged by Bath-Sheba \nwas a mating of the king to his land, signalized by pornographic \nhymns like the wedding-poems of ancient Sumeria. 12 \n\nThe fragment of love-liturgy now called Solomon\'s Song has beei \nan embarrassment to theologians, even though they strenuously \ninsisted it was an allegory of Christ\'s love for his church, Lady Ecclesia. \nIt was hard to explain why such a love should exude such a steamy air \nof obviously erotic sensualism. Yet the 18th-century scholar Herder was \npersecuted and hounded from one pastorate to another for daring to \nsuggest that Solomon\'s love poem should be accepted at face value, as a \npiece of Oriental erotica. 13 \n\nWhen the metaphors of this poem are unraveled, they prove to b< \nmore, not less, frankly sexual. The hortus conclusus or "enclosed \ngarden" is the internal genitalia of the virgin bride, where her spouse \n"enters paradise" from Hebrew pardes, "garden." 14 Solomon says, \n"A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain \nsealed." He proposes to unseal her, unlock her door, and "drink of \nspiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate" (Song of Solomon 8:2). \nThis metaphor is explained by the contemporary image of the \npomegranate, rimmon, as a female-genital symbol. Spiced wine meant \nthe secretion of the Goddess representing the blood of life: i.e., \nmenstrual blood, of which only kings and gods could taste. 15 \n\nSolomon\'s bride said invitingly, "Let my beloved come into his \ngarden, and eat his pleasant fruits." Solomon answered, "Open to \nme, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled \nwith dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. I have put off my \ngarment; how shall I put it on?" The king\'s dew-filled "head" was the \ncommon symbol of the penis, in royal wedding hymns of Sumer and \nAkkad. A king\'s union with the Goddess Inanna, Queen of the \nUniverse, was so described: "The king goes with lifted head to the \nholy lap, he goes with lifted head to the holy lap of Inanna." Every \nking\'s divine bride was Inanna "the queen, the vulva of heaven and \nearth." 16 \n\n\n\n948 \n\n\n\nA priestess impersonated the Goddess on the royal wedding night. Solomon and Sheba \n\nSolomon\'s mysterious "black, but beautiful" bride, the Shulamite, \n\nseems to have been no more than an ancient Canaanite title of the ^ ^ m wm \n\nGoddess, Zulumat, "Darkness." 17 Like the Goddess she was not \nonly the night and the moon; she was also the land and its crops. Her \nstature was like a palm tree, her breasts like clusters of grapes, her \nmouth like honeycomb, her teeth like flocks of sheep, her belly a heap \nof wheat set with lilies, and so on. In short she was the Enclosed \nGarden-paradise of Oriental kings, like Shalimar in the Far East the \nSemitic Sheol-Mari, or Mary of the enchanted garden underground. \n\nSimilarly the Enclosed Garden became a Christian symbol of the \nsame Mary. The Litany of the Virgin jumbled together many of the \nold fertility symbols, calling Mary the Enclosed Garden, Well of Water, \nGate of Heaven, Chosen Vessel, City of God, Beautiful Moon, \nBeloved of the Sun, Rose, Lily, Olive, and Palm. 18 Within the Virgin\'s \nhortus conclusus dwelt such phallic symbols as the Tower of David, \nTree of Life, enchanted unicorn, and Exalted Cedar of Lebanon, \nalways called "tall." The ancient meaning of "tall" combined the \nconcepts of "prompt, quick, docile, comely, handsome" flattering \ndescriptions of the divine phallus. 19 \n\nMary or Mari was linked with the Sheban moon-temple at Marib, \nhaving the same name and the title of almah or moon-woman, once a \npriestess of the Almaqah. Solomon\'s mother Bath-Sheba, who crowned \nhim, apparently represented the elder queen of Sheba, who was also \nthe Naked Goddess when viewed in her bath by the next king. Her \nspouse David had come to kingship by viewing her in her bath and \nshowing a satisfactory reaction. Prior to Solomon\'s reign, the king\'s \ndefeated tanist was Absalom or "Father Salomon," variants of Salem, \nSalma, Shalem, or Solomon. After lying with the royal concubines to \nprove his virility, Absalom died a sacrificial death on an oak tree, and \na phallic pillar was erected in his honor (2 Samuel 18:18). Bath-Sheba \nmeant literally the daughter of Shaybah, an ancient Arabic name of \nthe Goddess. 20 See Zenobia. \n\nIn one year Solomon received 666 talents of gold (1 Kings 10:14), \nthe mystic number of the Triple Goddess, later re-interpreted by her \nenemies as "the number of the beast" (Revelation 13:18). Clearly, \nSolomon worshipped the Goddess (1 Kings 1 1:5) and paid little or no \nattention to Yahweh. Apocryphal texts said Yahweh never forgave \nSolomon\'s paganism, but after his death condemned him to perpetual \npunishment, like that of Prometheus: to be daily devoured, forever, by \n10,000 ravens. 21 \n\nThe gold that came to Solomon was probably a symbol of his \nwisdom; for kings\' wisdom was generally ascribed to their union with \nthe Goddess who represented "mother-wisdom" (Hebrew hok-mah, \nafter Egyptian hek-maa). Sargon II also claimed to have received \n"gold" form the Arabian queen. 22 Centuries later, Arabian alchemists \ntalked in highly esoteric terms of the acquisition of mystic gold, which \n\n\n\n949 \n\n\n\nSon of Man \n\n\n\nmay have meant something different from the usual interpretation of \nmaterial gold from base metal. In medieval alchemy much was made \nof the occult link between gold and the Wisdom-goddess, variously \nnamed Sophia, Sapientia, Anima Mundi, Athene, or Luna. \n\nSolomon\'s legendary wisdom brought him almost as much rever- \nence from medieval occultists as Thoth-Hermes Trismegistus, god of \nmagic. Several grimoires purported to have been written by his hand; \nThe Key of Solomon was one of the most popular. Magic signs like \nthe pentacle and hexagram were often called Solomon\'s Seal. "Of a \ntruth," the Grand Grimoire said of Solomon, "what other man, save \nthis invincible genius, would have had the hardihood to reveal the \nwithering words which God makes use of to strike terror into the \nrebellious angels and compel them into obedience?" 23 Thus wizards \ninvoked Solomon\'s help in calling up demons for magical purposes. \n\nThe Bible is remarkably uncommunicative concerning Solomon\'s \ndeath, considering the intimate detail that describes his wedding \nnight, his temple furnishings, his household, etc. The Arabs said \nSolomon lost his magic ring while bathing in the Jordan, and forgot \nhis wisdom, so he was killed by a djinniwho ruled in his place. Rabbinic \nwriters said Solomon\'s corpse was stuffed and shown to the people on \nholy days to make them think he still lived.

It was \ncoined to prove Vishnu a god made wholly in the image of man, having \nno need of a mother. 1 Yet Vishnu himself finally adopted the worship \nof Mother Kali, saying in his hymn to her divinity, "The gods them- \nselves are merely constructs out of Her maternal substance." 2 \n\n"Son of Man" was subsequently applied to the Persian Messiah, \nthen to the Essenic Christ, both of whom were "born" at the hands \nof men, "of water and of the spirit." Men so born were supposed to be \nable to defeat death, whereas man born of woman was fated to die. \nThe Persian Son of Man, Yima the Splendid (copied from the Vedic \nYama) became a Lord of Death, "the good shepherd, the most \nglorious of those who were born, the sole mortal possessor of the solar \neye." He alone could "render men and beasts non-mortal." ? \n\nRepeating a bit of Persian eschatology, Jesus promised that on the \nLast Day "the Son of man shall come in the glory of the Father with \n\n\n\n950 \n\n\n\nhis angels" to judge the world (Matthew 16:27). Theologians have \nnever really decided who was the Father of the Son of Man. \n\n1. OTlaherty, 349. 2. Rawson, E.A., 159. 3. Larousse, 310. \n\n\n\nSophia, Saint \n\nCanonical adaptation of the Gnostic Great Mother: Latin Sapientia, \nGreek Sophia, the spirit of Female Wisdom. Symbolized by the Dove \nof Aphrodite (later transformed into a sign of the Holy Ghost), \nSophia once represented God\'s female soul, source of his power, just as \nKali-Shakti served to vitalize the Hindu gods. 1 \n\nThe Trattato Gnostico said Sophia was God\'s mother, "the great \nrevered Virgin in whom the Father was concealed from the begin- \nning before He had created anything." She was identified with \nIsis-Hathor, whose seven emanations gave each Egyptian his seven \nsouls. Irenaeus said Sophia like Hathor was the mother of the seven \nplanetary spirits, whose names were listed in Gnostic papyri as the \nmagic-working secret names of God. 2 \n\nThe Clementine Homilies called Sophia the All-Maternal Being, \nThe Queen, Lady Wisdom. Early Gnostic Christians held that, like \nKrishna and Shiva, or like Dionysus and Zeus, Christ and God together \nmerged with Sophia as an androgyne: "The Son of Man agreed with \nSophia, his consort, and revealed himself in a great light as bisexual. His \nmale nature is called \'the Savior,\' the begetter of all things, but his \nfemale, \'Sophia, Mother of All.\' " ? \n\nA Gnostic creation myth said Sophia was born from the primordial \nfemale power Sige (Silence). Sophia gave birth to a male spirit, \nChrist, and a female spirit, Achamoth. The latter gave life to the \nelements and the terrestrial world, then brought forth a new god \nnamed Ildabaoth, Son of Darkness, along with five planetary spirits later \nregarded as emanations of Jehovah: Iao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi, and \nUraeus. These spirits produced archangels, angels, and finally men. \n\nIldabaoth or Jehovah forbade men to eat the fruit of knowledge, \nbut his mother Achamoth sent her own spirit to earth in the form of \nthe serpent Ophis to teach men to disobey the jealous god. The serpent \nwas also called Christ, who taught Adam to eat the fruit of knowledge \ndespite the god\'s prohibition. 4 \n\nSophia sent Christ to earth again in the shape of her own totemic \ndove, to enter the man Jesus at his baptism in the Jordan. After Jesus \ndied, Christ left his body and returned to heaven. Sophia gave Jesus a \nbody of ether, and placed him in heaven to help collect souls. 5 Some \nsaid Jesus became Sophia\'s spouse and his glory depended on this sacred \nmarriage; for he was only one of the Aeons, a minor spirit, the \ncommon fruit" of the Pleroma. 6 \n\nSome said Sophia was also Jesus\'s mother, for she was the Virgin \nof Light whose spirit entered into the body of Mary to conceive him. \n\n\n\nSophia, Saint \n\n\n\nClementine Homi- \nlies Greek writings \nfalsely attributed to a \nfirst-century bishop of \nRome; actually com- \nposed by an anonymous \nChristian apologist \ntoward the end of the \n4th century. \n\n\n\n951 \n\n\n\nSophia, Saint She also entered the body of Elizabeth to conceive John the Baptist. \n\nSome said Sophia was to God as Metis to Zeus: his "mind." But \n\nSophia wasn\'t acceptable to the all-male church. Of the three mighty \n\nfemale powers in the Gnostic creation myth, all preceded Jehovah, \nand two of them opposed Jehovah as a tyrant, overruled his taboo, and \nsaved humanity from ignorance. It was a version that the Pauline \nchurches found lacking in appeal. \n\nNevertheless, Sophia was passionately adored by Eastern Chris- \ntians. Her greatest shrine was erected in Constantinople during the \n6th century a.d., and was one of the wonders of the world: the Church \nof Holy Sophia (Hagia Sophia). \n\nEmbarrassed by this magnificent monument to the Great Mother, \nRoman Christians claimed it was dedicated to a minor "virgin \nmartyr," St. Sophia, whose phony legend lacked even a date. Despite \nher virginity she was the mother of three daughters, also "virgin \nmartyrs": St. Faith, St. Hope, and St. Charity. The legend may have \narisen in personification of the saying that Wisdom gives birth to \nFaith, Hope, and Charity. Hagiographers took it literally, confusing the \nthree virtues with the three Charites. Catholic scholars now claim the \nchurch of Hagia Sophia was never dedicated to the Great Mother in \nany form, not even that of a female saint. They say its name which \nmeans "Holy Female Wisdom" in plain Greek really meant "Christ, \nthe Word of God." 7 \n\nJewish "Wisdom" literature owed much to the cult of Sophia, who] \nwas to reappear in medieval Jewish cabalism as the Shekina of God. \nYet the 8th and 9th chapters of Proverbs demonstrate the early conflict \nbetween followers of Sophia and those of God. The first of these \npassages urges the benefits of Sophia\'s worship; the second belittles her \nand her priestesses: \n\nDoth not Sophia cry? and understanding put forth her voice? She \nstandeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. \nShe crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in of the \ndoors. Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. O \nye simple, understand Sophia: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding \nheart. Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my \nlips shall be right things . . . for Sophia is better than rubies; and all the \nthings that may be desired are not to be compared to her. I Sophia \ndwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. . . . \nCounsel is mine, and sound wisdom; lam understanding; I have \nstrength. By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. By me princes \nrule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. Hove them that love \nme; and those that seek me early shall find me. . . . I lead in the way of \nrighteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: that I may cause \nthose that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. . . . \n\nBlessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, \nwaiting at the posts of my doors. For whoso findeth me findeth life. . . . \n\n\n\n952 \n\n\n\nBut he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate Soteira \n\nme love death. Sothis \n\nThis was one side of a public-relations war. The other side was hmmmmmm \n\npresented by the following chapter, wherein God scorned the worship \nof the Goddess: \n\nSophia hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: she \nhath killed her beasts: she hath mingled her wine: she hath also \nfurnished her table. She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the \nhighest places of the city. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; as for \nhim that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, Come, eat of my bread, \nand drink of the wine which I have mingled . . . [but] the fear of the \nLord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is \nunderstanding. For by me [God] thy days shall be multiplied, and the \nyears of thy life shall be increased. . . . A foolish woman is clamorous: she \nis simple, and knoweth nothing. For she sitteth at the door of her \nhouse, on a seat in the high places of the city, to call passengers who go \nright on their ways: whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. . . . But he \nknoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths \nof hell. 8 \n\nThe "high places of the city" meant temples, therefore the \n\'woman" was the Goddess, who met with much resistance from \nFollowers of the God. Yet she was still in evidence during the Middle \n\\ges, as Sophia-Sapientia, Lady Wisdom, ruling deity of the Gnostic \njhilosophers who said the World Soul was born of her smile. 9 \n\n1.

The word came from primitive images of \nhe Savior as a phallic god who died in the act of fertilizing the earth. \n3 ersephone acquired the title as an annual bride of Pluto, or Hades, \nvho took her underground. \n\n\n\nSothis \n\nSreco-Egyptian name of the star Sirius, which "rose in the east" to \ninnounce the advent of the Savior Osiris each year at the onset of the \n^lile flood. "Three Wise Men" announced the rising of Sothis the \nhree stars in Orion\'s belt which point directly toward Sirius. As the \n\'Eye" of the Great Dog (Canis Major), Sirius was sometimes called \n2anopis or Dog- Eye, the same as the holy city of Anubis who, as Dog \n\n\n\n953 \n\n\n\nSoul of Death, kept Osiris\'s soul in the star Sothis until his rebirth. See \nDog. \n\n\n\nSoul \n\nGermanic Seek, "soul," was feminine, used by mystics like Eckhart \nand Goethe in the same sense as Shakti\'m India: i.e., "the feminine \nUltimate Reality." \' Most ancient words for the soul were female: \npsyche, pneuma, anima, alma. God-souls were Goddesses: Kore, So- \nphia, Metis, Sapientia, Juno. The ancients believed every man had a \nfemale soul derived from the Mother Goddess through his earthly \nmother. \n\nEach Egyptian had seven souls, bestowed by the Seven Hathors \nwho guarded the planetary spheres and were fairy godmothers at the \nbirth of every child. The souls were aakhu, ab, ba, ka, khaibut, khat, and \nren: (1) primordial life spirit, resident in the blood; (2) the heart, \nformed from the mother\'s heart\'s blood; (3) the ghost that appeared \nafter death and flew in and out of the tomb, sometimes as a bird; (4) \nthe semblance or image, the other self seen in reflections; (5) the \nshadow; (6) the material living body, supposedly resurrected "in the \nflesh" after death; and (7) the secret name or soul-name. 2 \n\nGreeks connected different aspects of the soul with different \ndeities. Psyche, the spirit, was married to Eros, the body, until they \nwere separated by death: this was the philosophical meaning of the \nromantic myth of Psyche and Eros. Souls belonging to Persephone in \nthe underworld were shadows, or "shades" the umbra corresponding \nto the Egyptian khaibut (see Shadow). Reflection-souls in water \nseem to have been connected with the water-goddess Echo, as shown ! \nby the myth of Narcissus. \n\nPatriarchal writers tended to emphasize the soul called "breath," \npneuma, since this was the kind of soul that could be given by a \nfather. The idea came from Vedic India. Patriarchal Brahmans called \nthe vital principle, self, or soul Atmen, "breath," cognate of the \nGreek atmos, "air." Brahman fathers gave their children breath-souls as \nopposed to the souls of blood, heart, name, flesh, mind, shade, etc., \ncontributed by mothers. Therefore Brahmans regarded the breath-soul \nas the only important one. A Brahman father pretended to bring his \nnewborn infant to life by breathing on it three times, putting a soul into \nits body. 3 Like all Aryan notions, this one reappeared in Europe \ncenturies later, in a superstitious belief about lions. "For three days after \nbirth the cubs of the lioness gave no sign of life, but on the third day \nthe lion came and with his breath restored them to life." 4 \n\nThe biblical God performed the same miracle with breath, restor- \ning life to slain warriors who had become heaps of dry bones. At the \ninvocation of Ezekiel, God sent his breath into them from the winds, \nand they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great \narmy" (Ezekiel 37:10). We are always astonished at the ease with which \n\n\n\n954 \n\n\n\nthe ancient prophets ordered up impossible miracles, such as have Soul \n\nnever appeared within living memory. \n\nJesus\'s assertion that "the kingdom of God is within you" (Luke ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n17:21) filtered down from Ionian philosophers of the 6th and 5th \ncenturies b.c. They identified the air-soul as God, and proposed that the \ndivine spark within man was precisely the air he breathed, the \n"finest" element, forming the personal soul and the Oversoul at the \nsame time. Diogenes of Apollonia set forth this doctrine: \n\nMankind and the other animals live on air, by breathing; and it is to them \nboth soul and mind. \n\nThe soul of all animals is the same, namely air which is warmer than \nthe air outside, in which we live, though much colder than that near \nthe sun. \n\nIn my opinion that which has intelligence is what men call air, and \nby it everything is directed, and it has power over all things; for it is just \nthis substance which I hold to be God. s \n\nThe philosophers reasoned that if God=air=soul, then the air \nwithin a breathing person was an inner God judging his actions an \ninterior conscience. So said the poet Philemon: \n\nlam he from whom none can hide, in any act which he may do, or be \nabout to do, or have done in the past, be he god or man. Air is my \nname, but one might also call me Zeus. I, as a god should be, am \neverywhere here in Athens, in Patrae, in Sicily, in all cities, in every \nhome, in every one of you. There is no place where is not Air. And he \nwho is present everywhere, because he is everywhere of necessity \nknows everything. 6 \n\nChristians largely accepted the air-soul theory, drawing out of it \ntheir ideas of invisible ghosts that could be felt but not seen, like air; and \nthe notion that the soul can depart from the body through the nose or \nmouth, like breath. Yet older ideas of the soul also hung on. \n\nThe Egyptian doctrine of the seven souls, descending from the \nseven planetary spheres, passed into Gnostic Christianity as seven \nqualities of souls drawn from, and influenced by, the planetary spheres. \nComing down from heaven to enter a newborn body, the soul had its \noriginal purity adulterated by sins and passions as it passed through the \nspheres: "As the souls descend, they draw with them the torpor of \nSaturn, the wrathfulness of Mars, the concupiscence of Venus, the \ngreed for gain of Mercury, the lust for power of Jupiter." Seven \ndeadly sins were acquired from the seven spheres, but they could be \nshed again after death as the soul ascended through the same spheres \nin the reverse direction, enroute to heaven. Christians generally restrict- \ned the number of souls to one, but some Gnostics held that every \nman has two souls, one emanating from the First Mind, and one called \nthe God-seeing soul, "put in from the revolution of the heavens." 7 \n\nTheories on the physical seat of the soul in the body have been \nmany and various. The ancients usually placed the soul in the heart \nor the liver. Patriarchal thinkers declared that a man\'s testicles held the \n\n\n\n955 \n\n\n\nSpeaking in Tongues \n\n\n\nSow souls of his future children; St. Thomas Aquinas and other Christian \n\nauthorities concurred in this. Some souls were external; they dwelt in \n\numbilical cords, placentae, nail clippings, or shorn hair; any injury to \n\nthese articles would injure the person. A more recent theory, dating \n\nfrom the early Age of Enlightenment, was that the seat of the soul is \n\nthe pineal gland. \n\n1 BardoThodol,xxx\\. 2. H. Smith, 24. 3. Hays, 223. 4. Male, 15. \n5.

As a death goddess, Freya had the title of \nSyr, "Sow." l Demeter-Persephone or "Demeter the Destroyer" was \nsometimes called Phorcis the Sow, mother of the Phorcids or Fatal \nWomen. One of these was Circe, swine-goddess of Aeaea, who could \nturn men into sacrificial pigs. 2 Her island Aeaea meant literally \n"Wailing," a reference to the ritual laments accompanying sacrifices of \nthe god in pig form. \n\nThe self-sacrifice of Vishnu in the form of a boar was repeated in \nwestern Indo-European myths, where the god was Porcus, Phorcus, \nor Orcus, a Lord of Death. Ore means "pig" in Irish; and the Orkney \nIslands were once sacred to the devouring Sow. 3 \n\nIn Tantric Buddhism the Goddess is still worshipped as the \nDiamond Sow, Marici. She sits on a lotus throne drawn by seven \npigs. On earth she is incarnate in a real woman, the female counterpart \nof the Dalai Lama. 4 See Boar; Vishnu. \n\n1. Turville-Petre, 168. 2.

Spartacus was a would-be Orphic savior, viewing \nhimself as an incarnation of the god. His wife, a priestess of Orpheus- \nDionysus, saw in a dream the Orphic serpent coiled around Spartacus\'s \nhead, indicating that he would do great deeds and would die a hero\'s \ndeath. 1 Her prophecy was fulfilled. Spartacus\'s revolt was soon put \ndown, and he was caught and executed in the manner of a sacred \nking. \n\nl.Dumezil,517. \n\n\n\nSpeaking in Tongues \n\nGlossolalia, "speaking in tongues," was often seen in episodes of \nreligious ecstasy or trance and was anciently considered a proof of divine \ngrace. St. Paul was proud of his ability to "speak in tongues" more \n\n\n\n956 \n\n\n\nthan any of his followers (1 Corinthians 14:18). Early Christians Sphinx \n\nactually believed the speaker in tongues was expressing himself in Spider \n\nanother language or languages not known to his conscious mind, ^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\nthrough temporary possession by the divine spirit. The idea came \noriginally from Buddhists who claimed that when Buddha addressed \ngods, demons, men, and animals, each heard the Enlightened One \nspeak in the language he could understand. 1 \n\nIn reality, glossolalia is only meaningless babbling that may pour \nforth from an entranced person. Not one authenticated case of \nspeaking in tongues has ever been observed, where any real language \nwas spoken and identified by a native speaker of the same language, \ntogether with evidence that the same language was wholly unknown to \nthe possessed one. \n\nl.Waddell, 159. \n\n\n\nSphinx \n\nMother Hathor as a lion-headed sphinx asked men her mystic riddle, \nand killed those who couldn\'t answer, until King Oedipus solved her \nriddle and cast her out of Thebes. The riddle was: "What goes on \nfour legs at dawn, two legs at midday, and three legs at sunset, and is \nweakest when it has the most support?" The answer was either man \nor god. The sun god Ra, Hathor\'s offspring, grew old and feeble at the \nend of each day and walked with a third leg: a cane. 1 Some said Ra\'s \nweakness was the result of his mother\'s curse. \n\nAs the two-faced Goddess of birth and death, the Sphinx some- \ntimes looked in two directions, with two heads and two foreparts. \nThis glyph was called xerefu and akeru, "the Lions of Yesterday and \nToday," similar to the Goddess\'s Greek designation of Alpha and \nOmega. 2 \n\n1.

The classic myth \nof Athene\'s jealousy of the maiden Arachne, which caused her to \nturn Arachne into a spider who continued to practice her incomparable \nskill in spinning and weaving, was mistakenly deduced from an icon \nshowning Athene with her totemic spider spinning the web of Fate, \nfrom which the future could be foretold. An English writer of the \n17th century still thought "Minerva" (Athene) gave spiders a special \nability to foretell the weather. 1 \n\nIn Hindu myth, the spider represented Maya, virgin aspect of the \nTriple Goddess, spinner of magic, fate, and earthly appearances. 2 \nThe spider\'s web was likened to the Wheel of Fate and the spider to the \nGoddess as a spinner, sitting at the hub of her wheel. \n\n\n\n957 \n\n\n\nstarted \nSlHU Maris \n\n\n\nThe female spider\'s habit of devouring her mate led to identifica- \ntion of the spider with the death goddess, Maya transformed into \nKali-Uma In Aztec myth, with its mysterious archaic relation to India, \nspiders represented the souls of warrior women from the pre-Aztec \nmatriarchate, like the Amazonian Fate-spinners. At the end of the \nworld these women would descend from heaven on their silken \nthreads and eat up all the men on earth, like eight-legged Valkyries. \nIndeed there were Scandinavian associations, too. Odin\'s horse \nSleipnir (Slippery) was gray and had eight legs, like a spider; it also \nrepresented Odin\'s "Fate" in that it was associated with the gallows \non which he was hanged. _ \n\nMedieval Europe usually associated spiders with witches. The folk \ntale of the Spider and the Fly suggested the once widespread belief \nthat flies are souls in search of a female entity to eat them and give them \nrebirth.\' See Arachne. \n\n1.

The infinite variety of her \nmanipulations of elemental ingredients "gave rise to all perceptible \nphenomena." 1 \n\nAccording to Stoic doctrine, the karmic law of Nature was beyond \nthe power of any god to rescind, for the gods themselves were subject \nto the same law, and in common with other creatures would be \ndestroyed eventually. Thus Stoicism stood in opposition to the Judeo- \nChristian hypothesis of miracles, by which God broke his own laws from \ntime to time. Stoics said whatever is, is natural. \n\nThe Stoic concept of Fate or Nemesis was like the Tantric \nconcept of Kali. To know the Goddess was to accept the fact of \ndeath, and to bow before the decrees of Fate as gracefully as possible. \n\nStoicism appealed to Roman intellectuals such as Seneca and \nLucretius, who despised religious commercialism and hypocrisy. The \nStoic sage Persius seems to have been a model for the story of Christ\'s \nencounter with the money-changers in the temple. It was Persius the \nStoic who first demanded, "What is gold doing in a holy place?" 2 \n\nEarly Christians envied the esthetic elegance of Stoic theology and \ntried to assimilate it, but the basic premises of Stoicism and Christian- \nity couldn\'t be reconciled. "The difference between the two \nconceptions cannot fail to manifest itself. . . . Stoic ethics are self- \nsufficing; they proceed from nature, so to speak, and do not rely upon \ngrace; they have no need of a doctrine of Redemption. . . . There is \nnothing in common between them and Christianity save the elements it \nonce borrowed from them."* \n\nNevertheless, Christian admirers of Stoicism strove to assimilate \nStoic principles, such as the brotherhood of man, which Christian \nGospels did not teach. St. Augustine even borrowed the phrase coined \nby Marcus Aurelius in his Stoic vision of all races dwelling as kindred \nin the "City of Zeus," though Augustine revised the title to "City of \nGod."* \n\n1 .

"He" was called a protector of the sun, yet \n"he" always appeared in the garments of a Chinese woman, indicat- \ning an origin both feminine and rooted in lands west of Japan. 6 \n\n\' Among the ancient Arabs, the sun was a Goddess, Atthar, some- \ntimes called Torch of the Gods. 7 The Celts had a Sun Goddess \nnamed Sulis, from sail, meaning both "eye" and "sun." Germans called \nher Sunna. Norwegians called her Sol. 8 In Scandinavia she was also \nknown as Glory-of-Elves, the Goddess who would give birth to a \ndaughter after doomsday, thus producing the new sun of the next \ncreation. 9 The Eddas said: "One beaming daughter the bright Sun \nbears before she is swallowed by Fenrir; so shall the maid pace her \nmother\'s way when the gods have gone to their doom." 10 \n\nThe Sun Goddess Sul, Sol, or Sulis was worshipped in Britain at \nthe famous artificial mountain in the Avebury complex of megalithic \nmonuments, now known as Silbury Hill. Here she gave birth to each \nnew Aeon from her great belly-tumulus, over 1 30 feet high and more \nthan 500 feet in diameter. "The influence of the British Goddess, Sul, \nextended over the greater part of south west England, and her \nworship appears to have been conducted on the tops of hills, overlook- \ning springs. Thus near her springs at Bath we have the isolated hill \ncalled Solsbury, or Sulisbury, probably the seat of her worship." At \nBath, Romans identified Sul with Minerva and set up altars to her \nunder the name of Sul Minerva. 11 \n\n1. Larousse, 408 etseq. 2. Campbell, Or.M., 463. 3. O\'Flaherty, 339. \n\n4.

She chose Shiva the Condemned One \nas her consort, casting over his head a wreath of flowers representing \nher yoni enveloping his lingam. In the role of sacred king he would die \nin his mating, like a penis, and his bridal wreath became the funeral \nwreath laid on his grave. 1 His divine bride followed him into the \nunderworld and brought him back, as Ishtar followed Tammuz and \nAphrodite followed Adonis. 2 \n\nSvayamara meant a love-death (Teutonic Liebestod), a sinister \nimplication for the ones who originally "caught the bride\'s bouquet." \nBut later patriarchy converted the spirit of Sati into a symbol of the \ndutiful wife who followed her deceased husband into the underworld, \nwhether she wanted to or not. "Sati" was corrupted into the word for \nwidow-sacrifice, suttee. Up to the 19th century it was customary to \nburn widows on their husbands\' funeral pyres, until the British govern- \nment in India finally classified the rite of suttee as "homicide" \nthough it was never homicide, but only gynocide. 3 Widowers were \nnever slain for the sake of their dead wives. \n\n1.

Like European bards and minnesingers \nwho copied them, medieval Sufi poets sang of the spiritual signifi- \ncance of love, exemplified in the woman called a Fravashi or "Spirit of \nthe Way." Sufis claimed the universe was held together by the \nfeminine forces of motherhood and sexuality. To survive within a \nrabidly patriarchal society, however, the Sufis disguised their doc- \ntrines in many allegorical symbols, and established a mystical system in \nwhich nearly every tenet was imparted as a graphic image or \nmetaphorical tale. Sir Richard Burton called Sufism "the Eastern parent \nof Freemasonry." See Arabia; Romance; Tantrism. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSukra \n\n"Seed," son of the planet Venus, with a second birth from the penis \nof Shiva, who had swallowed him and then endured a pregnancy of 100 \nyears. 1 Like the stories of male birth-giving in Greece and the Middle \nEast, Sukra\'s myth was intended to establish the notion that men could \nbe "mothers." See Birth-Giving, Male. \n\nl.OTlaherty.354. \n\n\n\nSufism \nSun Goddess \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSun Goddess \n\nThough western iconography usually called the sun male and the \nmoon female, archaic Oriental tradition spoke of a female sun. Japanese \nruling clans traced their descent from a supreme Sun Goddess, \nOmikami Amaterasu. 1 In 238 a.d., Japanese tribes were ruled by a \nqueen named Himiko, Daughter of the Sun. 2 \n\nThe Hindu Great Mother took the form of the sun as the Goddess \nAditi, mother of the twelve zodiacal Adityas, spirits who would \n"reveal their light at Doomsday." 3 The Mahanirvanatantra said the sun \nwas the "garment" of the Great Goddess: "The sun, the most \nglorious symbol in the physical world, is the mayik vesture of Her who is \n\'clothed with the sun.\' " 4 The same Goddess, identified with Mary, \nappeared in the Gospels as the "woman clothed with the sun" (Revela- \ntion 12:1). \n\nTantric Buddhism recognized a precursor of the Middle-Eastern \nMari, or Mary, as the sun. Her monks greeted her at dawn as "the \nglorious one, the sun of happiness. ... I salute you, O Goddess Marici! \nBless me, and fulfil my desires. Protect me, O Goddess, from all the \neight fears." 5 \n\nWhen the Japanese revised their mythology to accommodate new \npatriarchal ideas, the Goddess Marici was masculinized, and it was \nforgotten that she was once identical with Omikami Amaterasu. Yet \nthere was a strange ambivalence about the "powerful god" called \n\n\n\n\nSun Goddess \n\n\n\n961 \n\n\n\nSwHtfla \n\n\n\non it; so, sorrowfully revealing his name, Lohengrin was obliged to leave \nElse and return to the Mount of Paradise. Other versions of the story \nsaid he took her with him to Montsalvatch, where they lived happily \n\never after. 8 \n\nOther stories said Lohengrin appeared in his swan-feather costume \nto defend Clarissa, Duchess of Bouillon, against the Count of \nFrankfort, who tried to steal her duchy. Or, he took up the cause of \nBeatrice of Cleves, whose property rights were threatened by hostile \nbarons. 9 Though he sallied forth to the rescue of several ladies in \ndistress, the Swan-knight\'s real home was always "the mountain \nwhere Venus lives in the Grail." 10 \n\n1 Baring-Gould, C.M.M.A., 568. 2.

Swastikas appear on Paleo- \nlithic carvings on mammoth ivory from the Ukraine, dated ca. 10,000 \nB.C. 1 Swastikas figure on the oldest coinage in India. 2 Persia, Asia \nMinor, and Greece represented the rotating axis mundi with the symbol \nof a swastika. On a Boeotian amphora of the 7th century B.C., the \nswastika was presented as a sacred sign of the Goddess Artemis. 3 It also \nrepresented many other deities from Iceland to Japan, Scandinavia to \nNorth Africa. It was much used in Troy and Mycenae before the 1 3 th \ncentury B.C. 4 \n\nSanskrit svastika meant "so be it" or "amen." In Japan, the swas- \ntika was an ideogram for "infinity" the number 10,000, which was \na synonym for infinity because it was the highest number Japanese sages \ncould visualize. 5 \n\nThere were two basic types of swastikas: the left-pointing, counter- \nclockwise, widdershins version called the Moon Swastika, and the \nright-pointing, clockwise one called the Sun Swastika. The former was \nnaturally associated with the Left-Hand Path of the Goddess, the \nlatter with the Right-Hand Path of the God. (See Left Hand.) Hindus \nsaid the solar swastika represented the god Ganesha, "Lord of Hosts," \nand the lunar swastika stood for Kali-Maya, his virgin bride, mother of \nBuddha. 6 As a reincarnation of his divine father, Buddha displayed \nthe sign of a cross, with a swastika enclosed in the female circle at the \nend of each arm. 7 Tibetan Buddhists said the right-handed swastika \nwas the Savior, the left-handed swastika meant witchcraft, or the \n"magic" of Mother Maya. 8 \n\nThe feminine moon swastika received the name oisauvastika and \nwas said to represent the autumnal half of the year, when the sun \n\n\n\nm \n\n\n\nwanes, while the masculine swastika stood for the vernal season when Swithin, Saint \n\nthe sun grows stronger. 9 As the feminine sauvastika suggested the sun \n\ngod declining toward his death and resurrection at the winter solstice, it mm^^mtm^^^^mm \nsometimes signified rebirth. \n\nIn Japan, the reborn Amida, "Buddha of Immeasurable Light," \nwore a left-handed swastika carved on his breast. 10 A similar left- \nhanded swastika was the sign of Thor\'s hammer on Scandinavian \ncoins. 11 Thor was one of the gods supposed to have come from \nancient Troy; and Trojan images of the Great Goddess showed a \nswastika within a female triangle on her belly, indicating the hidden \ngod prior to his next rebirth. 12 \n\nEarly Christians adopted the swastika to represent Christ, calling it \na crux dissimulata or disguised cross. It was also called crux gammata, \ngammadion, or gamma cross, because it showed the Greek letter \ngamma four times repeated. To Saxons it was fylfot, translated either \n"four-foot," referring to the four heavenly pillars at the corners of the \nearth, or "fill-foot," referring to the Christian habit of filling in the \nfoot of a church window with swastikas. 13 In old Danish churches, the \nswastika was the usual ornamentation for the baptismal font. 14 It was \nalso much used in medieval heraldry, as "cross potent rebated," croix \ngammee, or croix cramponnee. Still, knights who wore the swastika \non their shields couldn\'t be sure whether it stood for the cross of Christ \nor the cross of Thor, the latter being revered in swastika form all over \nGermanic areas, including the Scandinavian settlements in Lincolnshire \nand Yorkshire. 15 \n\nIn the 1930s, the Nazi party adopted the swastika because of an \nimpression that it was a "pure Aryan" sign. A variant of the swastika \nlong represented German Vehmic Courts (from Vehme, "punish- \nment") which began in the Middle Ages as civil tribunals for \npersecuting heretics, and became connected with the Inquisition. Their \nactivities were kept secret. In Napoleon\'s time, the Vehmic Courts \nwere still operating as underground organizations devoted to summary \njustice, like the Black Hand in Sicily. 16 From the Vehmgericht arose \nspecifically anti-Semitic secret societies of Austria and Germany in the \nearly 1900s the forerunners of Nazism. \n\n1.

Budge, E.L., 76. \n\n\n\nTammuz \n\nThe Christos or sacred king annually sacrificed in the temple at \nJerusalem, attended by women who dedicated him to their Goddess \nIshtar-Mari, Queen of Heaven, his mother and bride (Ezekiel 8:14). \nHe was a Hebrew version of Dionysus Liber, or Adonis, whom the \n\n\n\n970 \n\n\n\nRomans called the chief god of the Jews. l Tacitus however thought Tammuz \n\nthe Jews had given up worshipping Liber, for he "established a festive \n\nand cheerful worship, while the Jewish religion is tasteless and ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmean." 2 A month of the Jewish calendar is still named after Tammuz, \n\nwho was revered all the way up to the 10th century. 5 \n\nTammuz was imported from Babylon by the Jews, but he was \neven older than Babylon. He began as the Sumerian savior-god \nDumuzi, or Damu, "only-begotten Son," or "Son of the Blood." He \nfertilized the earth with his blood at the time of his death, and was \ncalled Healer, Savior, Heavenly Shepherd. He tended the flocks of stars, \nwhich were considered souls of the dead in heaven. Each year on the \nDay of Atonement he was sacrificed in the form of a lamb, son of the \nHoly Ewe; but his animal incarnation was understood to be a \nsubstitute for an earlier human sacrifice. A lament for the dead god \nasked rhetorically: \n\nWhy have they slain him, him of the plains? The Shepherd, the Man of \nWisdom, the Man of Sorrow why have they slain? The Lady of the \nVine languishes, the lambs and the calves languish. The Lord, the \nShepherd of the fold lives no more, the spouse of the Queen of \nHeaven lives no more. * \n\nOn the occasion of the god\'s death, temple women raised ritual \n"howls" or "ululations," which the Babylonians called alalu, and the \nGreeks called houloi. This was the sound mentioned by Ezekiel: in \nthe Jerusalem temple, women "wailed" for Tammuz. A typical "wail" \nis mentioned in Sumerian scriptures: \n\nFor him who has been taken away there is wailing; ah me, my child has \nbeen taken away, my Damu that has been taken away, my Christ that \nhas been taken away, from the sacred cedar where the Mother bore him. \nThe wailing is for the plants, they grow not; for the houses and for the \nHocks, they produce not; for the perishing wedded couples, for perishing \nchildren, the people of Sumer, they produce not. The wailing is for the \ngreat river, it brings the Hood no more. The wailing is for the fish ponds; \nthe fish spawn not. The wailing is for the forests; the tamarisks grow \nnot. The wailing is for the store-house; the honey and wine are not \nproduced. y \n\nSome liturgies addressed Dumuzi-Tammuz as Usir or Usirsir, \nvariations of the name Osiris, who was also the Good Shepherd and the \nkeeper of the "flocks" of the dead. 6 Though Tammuz occupied the \ncentral position in the sacred drama at Jerusalem, the New Testament \ntransformed him into a mere apostle of the new dying god, under the \nGreek form of his name, Thomas. \n\nA thousand years later, however, Syrian farmers still considered the \nsacrifice of Ta-uz, the grain god, essential to the welfare of the crops. \nHe was cruelly treated: slain by the reaper\'s sickle, his bones ground in a \nmill, his flesh scattered on the earth, his death bewailed by the \nwomen. 7 \n\n\n\n971 \n\n\n\nlanit \nTannhauser \n\n\n\nLike all earlier "saviors," Tammuz eventually was diabolized in \nChristian tradition. During the Middle Ages he was listed as one of \nhell\'s leading devils. Weyer\'s treatise on demonology made Tammuz \nhell\'s ambassador to Spain, probably because he was still worshipped \nby Saracenic sects in Spain. 8 \n\n1 Graves W.G. 368. 2. Tacitus, 660. 3.

Her \npriestesses were famous astrologers, whose prophecies were circulat- \ned throughout the Roman empire and even rivaled the \npronouncements of the Cumaean sybils. 2 \n\nThough Romans destroyed Carthage in the Punic Wars, Roman \nlegend traced the very origin of Rome to the Carthaginian mother- \ncity, as shown by the story of Aeneas, who came directly across the \nMediterranean from there, to found Rome. 3 The primitive Roman \nqueen Tanaquil, who conferred sovereignty on the "fatherless" Latin \nkings, the Tarquins, was none other than the Libyan Goddess Tanit. \nShe was also known as Libera, Goddess of Libya, whose festival the \nLiberalia was celebrated each year in Rome during the Ides of \nMarch. 4 An alternative name for the festival was Bacchanalia, dramatiz- \ning the love-death and resurrection of Bacchus Liber, or Dionysus, or \nConsus, which were various names for the same fertility god. 5 \n\nThe distinctive symbol of Tanit was a pyramidal shape, like a \nwoman in a very full skirt, topped by a disc-shaped full-moon head, \nwith upraised arms in the manner of the Egyptian ka. 6 Similar symbols \nrepresented such goddesses as Aphrodite, Athene, Venus, and Juno. \n\nl.Reinach,42. 2.

Tann, Dann, Danu, Di- \nana, Tannetis, or Dennitsa were variations of the same Goddess \n(Venus) whom Tannhauser adored in the shape of her mortal priestess, \nQueen Sybil. The legend of Tannhauser displayed considerable \nhostility to the authority of the pope, and presented the cult of the \nGoddess as an alternative to Christianity. See Sybil. \n\n\n\n972 \n\n\n\nTantrism Tantrism \n\nThe system of yoni-worship, or female-centered sex-worship, alleged- \nly founded thousands of years ago in India by women of a secret sect hhuhmhihi \ncalled Vratyas, forerunners of the devadasis or sacred harlots. 1 The \nreligion was associated with later written scriptures known as Tantras, \ntherefore it was called Tantrism. The primary object of its adoration \nwas the lingam-yoni, sign of male and female principles in conjunction \n(the god Shiva and the goddess Shakti-Kali). Tantrism is still widely \npracticed in India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet. 2 \n\nThe basic principle of Tantrism was that women possess more \nspiritual energy than men, and a man could achieve realization of the \ndivinity only through sexual and emotional union with a woman. A \nfundamental rite was controlled sexual intercourse, maithuna, Latin \ncoitus reservatus: sex without male orgasm. The theory was that a man \nmust store up his vital fluids rather than expending them in ejacula- \ntion. Through Tantric training, he learned to absorb through his penis \nthe fluid engendered by his partner\'s orgasm and to prolong sexual \nintercourse for many hours. In this way he could become like Shiva, the \nGod in perpetual union with his Goddess. Theoretically, the vital \nfluids thus conserved would be stored in a man\'s spinal column, mount \nthrough the chakras up to his head, and there flower forth with the \ninspiration of divine wisdom. The Tantras explain this and other \npractices based on worship of the Goddess, together with the philoso- \nphy underlying the rites. \n\nThe most sacred mantra (holy phrase) expressing Tantric worship \nwas Om manipadme hum, the Jewel (penis) in the Lotus (vulva). \nThe symbolic lingam-yoni often took the form of an altar, shaped like a \npenis in a vulva. 3 Remnants of Tantric practice inspired the medieval \nEuropean belief that "witches" worshipped at an altar represented by a \nfemale body. \n\nTantric Buddhism consisted of an uneasy marriage between an \noriginally ascetic Buddhist cult with ancient sexual disciplines. Like its \nChristian offshoot five centuries later, Buddhism was founded on \nopposition to the female principle and the belief that men must avoid \nwomen, in order to conserve their souls\' vitality by retaining their semen \nand concentrating on the Self. Buddhist monks claimed their prophet \nordered them to quell all sexual desire, and never to see or speak to \nwomen. 4 \n\nLike early Christianity, however, Buddhism soon spread out \nalong a continuum of sects ranging from the austere, puritanical Jains to \nexuberantly erotic Tantric Buddhists with principles like "Buddha- \nhood resides in the vulva." 5 All over Indian temples, Buddhist saints \nappeared with their voluptuous Shaktis in the divine embrace called \nYab-Yum (Father-Mother), representing everlasting orgasmic bliss \nthe real cause of the beatific smiles on the faces of the bodhisattvas. \n\nErotic forms of Tantric Buddhism penetrated all Asia, though \npatriarchal sects later suppressed them and denied their historical \n\n\n\n973 \n\n\n\nTantrism \n\n\n\nexistence. Tantric Buddhism flourished in China under the Six Dynas- \nties, T\'ang, and Mongol Yuan, until Confucian patriarchs succeeded \nin eliminating it. Japanese Shingon is an attenuated remnant. Tantrism \nis no longer mentioned in China or Japan; its art was destroyed; \nauthorities pretend it was never there at all. 6 \n\nThe same denial appeared in areas dominated by Islam where Sufi \nmystics had perpetuated a form of Tantrism. They emphasized the \ndiscipline oifana, "rapture," attainable only with a pir (Peri), a fairy \nmistress, also known as Fravashi, "Spirit of the Way." 7 Through her, \na man might achieve "the larger full surrender" said to pass beyond \nGod to realization of the ultimate Void that swallowed even the \ngods. 8 \n\nEarly Gnostic Christians sometimes called their religion synesak- \ntism, the Way of Shakti, another name for Tantrism. 9 These \nChristians were influenced by Oriental Tantrism as well as by some of \nits western forms, philosophies of Goddess-worship filtered through \nPythagorean and Neoplatonic mystics. Plotinus equated the mind\'s \nprogress toward the Ineffable with "the sight of a beautiful lady." \nAscent of the mind toward realization of divinity was divided into six \nsteps, beginning with perception of woman\'s beauty, culminating in \ncontemplation of Universal Beauty. 10 \n\nChristians like the Ophites and Montanists apparently practiced \nsexual adoration of the feminine life force under the name of Sophia, \nthe female Holy Spirit, a feminine soul or Shakti of God. Their rite of \n"spiritual marriage" was misunderstood by the orthodox, who later \ncalled it a Test of Faith. Certain male and female saints, they said, had \nproved their chastity by lying together naked without copulation. \nPossibly it was not sexual intercourse perse that such "saints" had \navoided, but only male orgasm. Like Tantric yogis, Gnostic saints \nsometimes thought themselves "perfected" by coitus reservatus, so they \ncould indulge in nakedness and promiscuity without being sinful. 11 \n\nThese sects were destroyed by the end of the 5 th century a.d. and \nno more was heard of the famous Test of Faith. 12 Orthodox fathers \nof the church ruled that sexual intercourse should have no purpose \nother than to beget offspring, and sexual pleasure should be altogeth- \ner denied to women. 13 \n\nWhile Tantric Christians were condemned as heretics, Islamic \nleaders were attacking Sufi cults of love. 14 Sufi mysticism survived \nunderground, in the hands of troubadours who called themselves \nLovers and adored the female principle as the world-sustaining \npower. Sufi yoni-worship influenced European troubadours, who \nfounded cults of Courtly Love in the centuries following the cru- \nsades. The church called them devil-worshippers because they \n"sinfully" loved women instead of God, and women were equated \nwith the devil by the theological opinion of the time. 15 See Romance. \n\nHeroes of the Courtly Love movement apparently practiced \nTantric maithuna under the name of drudaria, a kind of love \n\n\n\n974 \n\n\n\nassociated with male self-denial, yet not at all chaste. On the contrary, its Tao \n\npoetry was highly erotic. 16 Bardic romance sometimes showed dis- \ntinct connections with eastern Tantrism, as when Peredur\'s mystic ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nlady-love revealed that she came from India, or when Tristan told his \nlady-love Iseult that his name was the syllabically-reversed Tantris. 17 \n\nThough never officially recognized, Tantric sex has been practiced \nthroughout history in western nations, either in accordance with a \nsecret teaching, or as an independent discovery. Medieval Goddess- \nworshippers vilified as "witches" apparently knew of it, and may have \nused it as a birth-control technique. It was claimed that no woman was \never made pregnant at the witches\' Sabbath. 18 \n\nIn 1848, maithuna was again publicized by the founder of the \nOneida Creek Community, John Humphrey Noyes, who rediscov- \nered it while trying to protect his wife from "the horrors and the fear of \ninvoluntary propagation" after she had four disastrous pregnancies. 19 \nNoyes called his discovery "male continence," or karezza, and trained \nmembers of his community in the technique. Then they engaged in \nwhat Noyes called "complex marriage" with various partners, without \nunwanted pregnancies. 20 Several occult societies of the 19th and \n20th centuries made use of Tantric coitus reservatus for various reasons, \nbut it was seldom admitted to the "normal" sexual repertoire of the \nwestern male. \n\n1 .

Men were taught to \nreserve their vital forces, which could be dangerously depleted by \nejaculation, and to let their weaker Yang nature absorb the powerful \nYin force engendered by a woman\'s orgasm. Men were advised to keep \nthis "key" secret from women, for if women learned to suppress their \nown orgasms while bringing men to ecstasy, they would greatly surpass \nmen in wisdom and spiritual energy. Their already superior Yin \nmagic would remain in their bodies, while the man\'s lesser Yang magic \nwould be added to it. 1 \n\nLao-Tse said: "How unfathomable is Tao like unto the empti- \nness of a vessel, yet, as it were, the honored Ancestor of us all. Using \nit we find it inexhaustible, deep and unfathomable. Now pure and still is \nthe Way! I do not know who generated it. It may appear to have \npreceded God." 2 \n\n1. Bullough, 256. 2.

Like Jupiter \nPluvius, he fertilized Mother Tara with rain. 4 The traditional words \nof a fanfare, Taran-Tara, originally came from a magic "cry" expressing \nthe union of the two deities. \n\nTantric Buddhists in Tibet still pray to Mother Tara like this: \n\nHail! O verdant Tara! The Savior of all beings! Descend, we pray Thee, \nfrom Thy heavenly mansion, at Potala, together with all Thy retinue of \ngods, titans, and deliverers! We humbly prostrate ourselves at Thy lotus- \nfeet! Deliver us from all distress! O holy Mother! We hail Thee! O \nrevered and sublime Tara! Who are adored by all the kings and princes of \nthe ten directions and of the present, past and future. ! \n\nIn India, Tara is called "the most revered" of the old pre-Vedic \nGoddesses, just as in all lands populated by Aryan peoples, Mother \nEarth was the first, oldest, and greatest of deities. 6 \n\nl.Dumezil,676. 2.

In addition to the now-standard 52 four \nsuits from ace to king Tarot packs had a fifth suit, the Major Arcana \n(Great Secrets), a trump suit consisting of 22 picture cards. Only one of \nthese trump cards now remains in the deck, the Joker, Jester, or Fool. \nPresent card decks are only remnants of what medieval cards used to \nbe that is, the Tarot. \n\nFour court cards also disappeared from the suits: the four knights. \nTherefore, modern cards have only three court cards per suit: king, \nqueen, and jack. Disappearance of the knights led some scholars to \nthink Tarot cards might have been invented by the Knights Templar, \nwho were declared heretics, disgraced, and exterminated in the 14th \ncentury. Though Templars may have learned from the Saracens to \nuse cards, they didn\'t invent them. 1 Unbound "books" of picture cards \nwere long used in the east to teach mystical doctrines to people who \ncouldn\'t read. 2 \n\nItalian author Covelluzo wrote: "In the year 1379 the game of \n\n\n\n976 \n\n\n\ncards was brought to Viterbo from the country of the Saracens, \nwhere it is called naib." In that year, Saracen mercenaries served in the \narmies of rival popes Urban VI and Clement VII; but Saracenic \nArabs had occupied Spain, southern France, Sicily, and Italy since the \nearly 8th century. The Arabs dominated Spain until the 1 5 th centu- \nry. Their word naib became Spanish naipes, "playing cards." 3 \n\nGypsies migrating from their ancient home in Hindustan also \nbrought cards into Europe. Tarot cards have been called "the \ncompendium of gypsy philosophy and religion." 4 The world\'s oldest \ngambling game, Faro, came from gypsies who were supposed to be \n"Egyptians," and whose "game of kings" was naturally named Pharaoh \n(Faro) because, it was said, their cards had pharaohs painted on \nthem. 5 Spanish gypsies introduced Spain\'s national card game, ombre \n(Spanish hombre), "the game of man," which was as much a system \nof mystical divination as a game. Ombre was "a modification of the \nearlier game of primero ... of all modern games that which most \nresembles the ancient tarot. " 6 \n\nThe mysterious disappearance of the trump suit and the knights \nwas connected with more or less consistent hostility of Christian \nauthorities toward the cards. In 1370, a monk named John of Brefeld \nsaid in the symbolism of the cards "the state of the world as it is now \nis most excellently described and figured." But this turned out to be a \nheretical opinion. Other churchmen claimed the Cathari used cards \nto teach their Gnostic faith. In 1 378, the cards were banned in \nRegensburg, Germany. In 1381, they were condemned in Mar- \nseilles. In 1397, they were forbidden in Paris. In 1423, St. Bernardino \nof Siena said the cards were invented by the devil. In 1441, importa- \ntion of cards was prohibited in Venice. In 1450, a Franciscan friar \ndenounced cards in northern Italy. John Northbrooke later wrote: \n"The play at Cards is an invention of the Devil, which he found out \nthat he might the easier bring in Idolatry amongst men." Scottish \nclergymen called cards "the Devil\'s books." Churchmen were especial- \nly enraged by the Major Arcana or trump suit. These 22 little \npictures were called "the rungs of a ladder leading to the depths of \nhell." 7 Cards were described as the devil\'s breviary, "in which various \nfigures are painted, just as they are ih the breviaries of Christ, which \nfigures show forth the mysteries of evil." 8 \n\nOne may well wonder, what were these mysteries? What "idols" \ndid the idolatry of cards show forth? What doctrines were taught by \nthe "devil\'s breviary"? \n\nThe Tarot has been linked with several non-Christian mystical \nsystems: the Cabala, Hermetic magic, classical paganism, witchcraft. \nDr. Gerard Encausse wrote, "The game of cards called the Tarot, \nwhich the Gypsies possess, is the Bible of Bibles. It is the book of \nThoth Hermes Trismegistus, the book of Adam, the book of the \nprimitive Revelation of ancient civilizations." 9 A more recent student \nof the cards says, "The Tarot speaks in the language of symbols, the \n\n\n\nTarot \n\n\n\nDr. Gerard En- \ncausse French \nphysician, theoso- \nphist, and founder of \nthe popular spiritual- \nmasonic Order of \nMartinists. Under \nthe pen name of Papus, \nhe published the \nhighly influential Le \nTarot des Bohe- \nmiens in 1 889, setting a \nprecedent for Tarot \ninterpreters of the early \n20th century. \n\n\n\n977 \n\n\n\nTarot language of the unconscious, and when approached in the right \n\nmanner it may open doors into the hidden reaches of the soul." 10 \n._ In the east, whence cards originally came, there was an ancient \n\ntradition of religious insights taught through dramatic presentation or \nthrough pictures. Eastern mystics believe in the existence of a secret \ninternational symbol-code known only to initiates, whereby the true \nmeanings of religious mysteries are revealed. Similarly it was thought \nthe hieroglyphs of Egypt and central America began as a secret \nsymbol-code. Pythagorean and Orphic initiates used such code systems \nin antiquity. European mystery plays, too, conveyed Gnostic or non- \nChristian ideas in symbols and tableaux of very ancient origin, under the \nnoses of churchmen who would have suppressed them if they had \nunderstood their meaning. 11 \n\nThe Tarot strongly resembles an Oriental symbol-code when \nobserved in relation to doctrines prevailing in the east at the time of \nits European debut. Pictures of the Major Arcana can be linked with \npageants of the mystery plays, Gnostic teachings, and Orphic icons. \nHere was the real reason for opposition to the trump suit opposition so \nbitter that in the end all trumps were excised except the Fool, a \n"know-nothing." Because of the church\'s hostility, today\'s card players \nhave no trump suit, and are obliged to name one of the other suits \n"trumps" when necessary. \n\nImages of the Tarot suggest female-centered, cyclic doctrines of \nreincarnation such as the old religions taught. The cards probably \nwere the original "elf-books," allegedly given by the fairies to people \nthey loved, which enabled them to foretell the future. 12 Cards were \nassociated with witches. In German towns where witch persecutions fell \nheaviest, painters of the forbidden cards were women. 13 Moakley has \npointed out that "preachers have never liked playing cards, and it can be \nsaid that the story the cards tell is very much opposed to the basic \ntenets of Christianity." H \n\nTo understand the story, one must study the cards\' format. The \nfour suits of the Minor Arcana or Lesser Secrets are clearly related to \nOriental images of the elements. The first suit was Cups, Chalices, or \nGrails; it later became the suit of hearts. The second was Wands, \nRods, Batons, or Scepters now converted into clubs, though the club \nis not a club but a trefoil. The third suit was usually called Pentacles, \nalso rendered Coins, Disks, Denari, or Pomegranates, which became \ndiamonds. Finally there was the suit of Swords, modern spades, \nderived from Spanish espada, sword. \n\nAs cup, scepter, ring, and sword, these emblems were displayed by \nthe four-armed androgynous deity Ardhanarisvara Kali and Shiva \nmerged. 15 Other gods, such as the monkey god Hanuman, held the \nsame symbols. 16 The female earth principle Brawani also carried the \nelements as lily, flame, cross, and sword. 17 Like her the Greek Goddess \nNemesis or Fate displayed the same symbols as a cup, apple wand, \nwheel, and sword. 18 \n\n\n\n978 \n\n\n\n\nThese Tarot suit symbols stood for paired male-and-female ele- Tarot \n\nmerits: female water with male fire, female earth with male air. These \n\nin turn were linked with the four stages of life established by Tantric ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nphilosophers: Sambhoga, Nirmana, Artha, and Moksha. 19 These four \nlife-stages had the following "elemental" meanings. \n\n1 . Sambhoga, the Life of Enjoyment, was related to the feminine \nWater element and its symbol the cup, grail, or heart. It referred to \n\nthe period of youth under the tutelage of the Mother, when pleasures of \nthe senses figure most prominently in the life experience, while the \ncup of life fills up with feelings, consciousness, awareness of others. The \nTarot suit of Cups therefore was traditionally applied to the subject of \nlove, family relationships, marriages, children, emotion: matters of the \nheart, or "hearts." \n\n2. Nirmana, the Process of Building, was related to the masculine \nFire element and its symbol the phallic wand, scepter, rod, or club. It \nmeant young adulthood, the period of assertion of power, a peak of \nenergy. The wand or dorje represented the phallic lightning streaking \ntoward the waters. Tarot readers therefore applied the suit of Wands to \nmatters of status, power, business, and commerce. \n\nThe straight Wand became a trefoil through an alchemical trans- \nformation. The trefoil was an alchemical symbol for wood, sometimes \ncalled Wood of the Tree of Life. 20 The Chinese considered wood a \nfifth element, placed between earth, which gave birth to it, and fire, \nwhich consumed it. 21 The Wand of the Tarot associated with fire would \nhave meant a wooden torch, therefore the symbol of wood changed it \ninto a modern "club." \n\n3. Artha, "Earth," stood for Wealth or Possessions: the period of Symbol of Wood \nmiddle age when the fruits of labor accumulate, and grown children \nalso are "wealth." The feminine Earth element was associated with \nriches in all Indo-European traditions, and so the Goddess\'s pentacle \nbecame a diamond, the Far-Eastern earth-symbol whose very name \nmeant "Goddess of the World." The oldest form of money was a \nfemale-genital cowrie shell, and coins used to be manufactured in the \nMother Goddess\'s temple at Rome. 22 It was not illogical then that the \nTarot suit of Pentacles was related to money matters and property. \nSometimes they were Pomegranates, another female symbol. 23 \n\n4. Moksha, "Liberation," or the Art of Dying, was linked with the \nmasculine Air element that meant the soul released from the body, \ninto the keeping of the Lord of Death, or Kali the Destroyer, represent- \ned by the sword. Eastern philosophers viewed old age, the fourth \nlife-stage, as an opportune time to learn to approach death without fear. \nHowever, the Tarot suit of Swords was linked with fear-inspiring \nevents: calamities, difficulties, threats, various kinds of doom. Even in \nordinary playing cards, the suit of spades, the Swords\' descendant, \nwas reckoned a suit of evil omen. \n\nThe underlying theory of cartomancy was that shuffling the \ncards was like mixing the elements in the larger world. Fate would guide \n\n\n\n979 \n\n\n\nT*ot the diviner to make combinations which, properly interpreted, would \n\napply to past or future events that the mingling of elements brought \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ about. Suit colors still show the blood-red of life for the "female" \n\nelements, the black of death for the "male" elements, according to very \nancient Oriental ideas of the active energy of the Lady of Life as \nopposed to the passivity of the Lord of Death. It is perhaps oddly \nsignificant that the oversized ace of modern cards is the ace of spades, \nsymbolically the sword of Father Heaven, which fortune-tellers called \nthe card of death. \n\nWhen churchmen failed to eradicate playing cards, there were \nseveral attempts to adapt the cards to Christian orthodoxy. Major \nArcana pictures were described as various episodes in Christ\'s Passion as \nif they represented Stations of the Cross. 24 Another system tried to \nrelate the four suits to the four Grail Hallows, listed in the 12th century \nas (1) the chalice of the Last Supper; (2) the wooden lance St. \nLonginus used to pierce Jesus\'s side; (3) the round paten or platter from \nwhich Jesus\'s disciples ate the paschal lamb, and (4) King David\'s \n"Sword of the Spirit." These Grail Hallows were themselves un- \nchristian, having been lifted from the Four Treasures of pagan \nIreland, magical emblems of the Tuatha De Danann. These were: (1) \nthe Cauldron of Regeneration; (2) the Spear of Lug; (3) the Stone of \nFal, or Stone of Sovereignty, which like the Scots\' Stone of Scone \nwould cry out in recognition of a true king; and (4) the Sword of \nNuada. 25 Typical lingam-yoni combination of the last two formed the \nfamous "Sword in the Stone" that figured in myths of Arthur, \nPerceval, and Galahad. \n\nA 1 5th-century game called Triumphs associated the four suits \nwith qualities resembling the Tantric definitions of the four elemental \nlife-stages: (1) Pleasures, (2) Virtues, (3) Riches, and (4) Virginities. 26 \nThese are easily identified with the male-female elements. "Virtues" \ncame from virtu, "manliness, uprightness" in the dual sense of erect- \nness. "Virginities" referred to the ascetic life recommended for the \nelder sage in eastern lands. But the game itself was named after the \nMajor Arcana the "trump" suit that clergymen called heretical. \n\nThe word "trump" came from trionfiov "triumph," the old Latin \nword for a religious procession, in which the very sequence, cos- \ntumes, and masks of the marchers stood for doctrinal teachings the \ninitiates could understand. Images of the deities, sacred masks borne \nby temple dancers, charioteers, priests, and priestesses displayed the \nexuviae, "attributes," of divinities. The leader of the procession was \nthe triumphator, a magistrate in charge of Rome\'s sacred games. At the \nend of the drama or the parade, celebrants raised the cry of Triumpe, \nannouncing the immanence of divine spirit in the things and persons \nshown. 27 Trump, then, originally meant "that which is divine," and \nlike everything divine it was credited with power of divination. \n\nAccording to ancient ideas of the divine order, deities revealed \nthemselves within a calculated framework of time. An initiate into \n\n\n\n980 \n\n\n\nany of the pagan Mysteries would meet them one at a time, learning Tarot \n\nnew thoughts from each. A time-frame appeared in the Tarot as well \n\nas the matter-frame of the elements. This had to do with its numbering. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe number of Minor Arcana cards is 56, a number with pro- \nfound meanings in Oriental philosophy. When Buddha was born, he \ntook his first 56 steps in each of the four cardinal directions, 7 forward \nand 7 back each way, signifying the 14 waxing and 14 waning days of \nthe moon and the lunar weeks, like the 14 steps on the heavenly ladder \nof Osiris. 28 \n\nThe same number of posts or stones representing "steps in time" \ncircled old temples of astronomical calculation, like Stonehenge. \nThere were 56 years in a sacred Great Year when lunar and solar cycles \ncoincided. 29 The number of the Tarot\'s Sun card is 19, the number \nof the Moon card 18: and the ancient Great Year consisted of two 19- \nyear periods combined with an 18-year period, a total of 56 years to \nbring the sun and moon together. The total number of cards in a Tarot \npack, 78, was the sum of all the numbers of the signs of the zodiac \nadded together: 1 +24-3+4+5 + 6 + 7 + 8+9+ 10+11 + 12. \n\nAmong the many derivations offered for the mysterious word \nTarot was the famous palindrome ROTA TARO ORAT (TORA) \nATOR: the Wheel of the Taro speaks of (the Law of) Hathor. 30 \nHowever, the Oriental background of card-divination and the 2 1 \nnumbered cards of the Major Arcana suggest an older connection with \nthe Goddess Tara, the Aryan Great Mother as "Earth," whose name \ngave rise to Latin Terra Mater and Celtic Tara. \n\nFrom ancient times, this Goddess was assigned 2 1 forms. Magic \ndiagrams, or painted dice-boards for divining the cause of illness, \nprophesying, and so on, are still known as "the 21 Taras." If the 21 \nnumbered cards of the Major Arcana can be related to such boards, \nthe Minor Arcana certainly echo the similar boards of 56 squares used \n"for determining the successive regions and grades of one\'s future \nrebirths." 31 In the Far East, games like cards and dice were used to \nteach esoteric doctrines. Tantric Buddhists still enjoy the Game of \nRebirth played with dice and a colorful board; it is both a pastime and a \nteaching aid for spiritual doctrines. 32 \n\nAs in China, cards were created from the possible throws of rods in \nthe I Ching, so divination by dice obviously influenced the format of \nthe Tarot. The two Tarot numbers 56 and 21 are dice numbers 21 \nthe number of possible throws by a set of two dice and 56 the number \nof possible throws by a set of three dice. Together they add up to 77 \nseven-times-eleven, the ultimate number of dice games. The Tarot \npack has one more card, making 78, but this card has no numerical \nvalue. It is the Fool, whose number is zero. In many Tarot layouts he \nstands apart, as an observer or querent. 33 \n\nThe form and meaning of Hindu temples also had some influence \non the Tarot. Images showing various manifestations or avatars of the \ndeities were placed in rows along corridors leading to the central Holy of \n\n\n\n981 \n\n\n\nTaiot Holies. Devout pilgrims passed through this "instructive picture \n\ngallery" saying prayers at each station. 34 Pictures of the deities and thei \n^^^^^^^^^^ attributes used to be painted on cards, like a miniature picture gallery, \nfor private meditation. Such a pasteboard pageant revealed sacred \nmysteries to those who knew its symbolism. In this circumstance one \nmight find the real reason why Christians objected to the Major \nArcana not because the cards were frivolous, but because their \nunderlying meanings were all too serious. \n\nThe most significant arrangement in Oriental sacred graphics was \nthe triangle, sign of the Goddess, known as the Kali Yantra or \nPrimordial Image. 35 A female triangle with a central dot or bindu, \n"spark of life," stood for the Goddess\'s genital power bringing life \ninto being. The 21 numbered Tarot trumps seemed designed to form \nthis yantra, 7 cards to each side of the triangle, with the unnumbered \nFool in the center standing for the bindu. \n\nThe three sides of the triangle traditionally represented the Triple \nGoddess as Three Fates, ruling past, present, and future; the three \ntrimesters of intrauterine existence; and the three larger trimesters of \nextrauterine life: from birth to coming-of-age at 21; from 21 to \nmiddle age at 42; and from 42 to the "grand climacteric" at 63. The \nsame three stages of man\'s life were depicted in such classical images \nas the Riddle of the Sphinx. \n\nThe biblical God promised his followers a lifetime of threescore \nand ten years, offering seven years more than older deities who \nguaranteed only the mystically trinitarian number of threescore and \nthree (63). The pagan lifespan was remembered in medieval times, \nwhen the age of 63 was known as the grand climacteric and was thougl \nto carry a threat of death. 36 It is still believed that 21 is the pinnacle of \nfirst maturity, because the pagan system of age-counting became incor- \nporated in common law. \n\nEach trimester spanned 21 years, the first exclusive multiple of th( \nsacred numbers 3 and 7. Therefore the past, present, and future \ncould be envisioned in the Major Arcana arranged in one of the \nGoddess\'s essential sigils. This triangular format was often used by \nthe gypsies, who understood that "triangle" meant "female" and that \nthe Goddess was the trinitarian ruler of Fate. 37 \n\nThe last trump is called the World, also known as the Bride, the \nShekjna, the Universe, Mother Nature, Sophia, or the Major For- \ntune. 38 This card always showed a naked woman dancing within a \nflower wreath, flanked by emblems of the four seasons. This was the \nfinal revelation of the Tarot system: the Goddess without her veils, the \nShakti bringing joy to the moment of death. According to the \ndoctrine of karma, "She it is who is ever desired, won, and lost again." 3 \nIn the cyclic or continuous layouts favored by gypsy cartomancers, \nthe realization of the World led "naturally on to the next card, the Fool \nsymbol of the newly born child commencing its life\'s journey. And so \n\n\n\n982 \n\n\n\nthe Ring of Return revolves once more." 40 In other words, the religion Tarot \n\nof the Tarot was a cyclic religion of reincarnation, not a linear \n\nreligion of heaven-or-hell choices. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nA popular method of laying out the cards signified two Rings of \nreturn, the joined circles of the Right-Hand Path (clockwise) and the \nLeft-Hand Path (counterclockwise), traditional symbols of male and \nfemale powers combined in a horizontal figure eight, the Vedic sign of \nInfinity. This was inherited by the Arabs along with the other \n"Arabic" numerals (actually of Indian origin), and is still the sign of \ninfinity in modern mathematics. The Major Arcana strongly suggest- \ned this figure-eight layout by their own traditional designs. \n\nThe lemniscate infinity-sign appeared as a wide-brimmed hat or \nhalo over the head of the Magician, a male figure beginning the first \ndecade of trumps at the #1 position. The same sign appeared again as \nthe same wide-brimmed hat or halo over the head of the Goddess of \nStrength, a female figure beginning the second decade of trumps at the \n#11 position. The male and female figures hinted that the first circle \noften cards was to rotate clockwise, along the "solar" path; the second \ncircle often cards was to rotate counterclockwise, along the "lunar" \npath. \n\nThe figure-eight represented union of the sexes not only in the \nOrient, but also in the ancient Celtic marriage rite preserved by the \nScottish custom of handfasting. Bride and groom joined their right \n"male" hands, then their left "female" hands also, forming the \ndouble-sexed Infinity sign to signify the blending of their two natures. \nThis custom is still followed in India, where the symbolism of the \nRight-Hand Path and Left-Hand Path was never lost. 41 \n\nBesides the Magician and the Goddess of Strength, another card \npresented the Infinity sign: the deuce of Pentacles, showing two discs \nembraced by two endlessly circling serpents, or a comparable lemniscate \ndesign. The importance of this card was revealed by special decora- \ntions; it usually bore the maker\'s trademark, as the ace of spades does \ntoday. Clearly, the figure-eight layout was urged. But then, what did \nit show? \n\nThe first circle stood for the realm of consciousness, matter, the \nworld of affairs: solar, outward-turning all the cards faced out. The \nsecond circle stood for the unconscious or the spirit lunar, inward, \nfeminine, the realm of mysteries and "true meanings." The center \ncrossing superimposed the two "mandala" cards, the Wheel of Fortune \nand the World (or Major Fortune). In such an arrangement, each \ncard in the solar sphere matched a card in the lunar sphere, their two \nnumbers always totaling 20, a sacred number in the eastern decimal \nsystem. 42 Each pair of matched cards revealed a secret identity or \nmeaning. \n\nThe Magician, or Hermes (#1) corresponded in the spiritual \nrealm to the masculine power of the Sun (#19). The Papess (#2) \n\n\n\n983 \n\n\n\nTa|ot was revealed as a personification of the Moon (#18). The Empress \n\n(#3) was the same as the Naked Goddess pouring forth her blessings \non land and sea, on the card of the Star (# 1 7) i.e., Astarte or Ishtar. \n\n^ ^^ m The Emperor (#4) stood for the Holy Roman Empire, which would \nsoon suffer a downfall, according to the heretical prediction; and the \ndownfall of the Empire was shown on the corresponding card, #16, \nthe Tower, or the House of God, blasted by the lightning of Lucifer the \nLight-bringer. Two figures toppling from the crown of the lightning- \nstruck Tower could well have been Emperor and Pope. As for the Pope \nhimself, shown on card #5, in the spiritual realm of the Tarot he was \nrevealed as the Devil (#15), taking the same pose on both cards with \ntwo worshippers at his feet. 43 \n\nTarot cards were not the only manifestations of these subversive \nsymbols. The same pictures mysteriously appeared in many places, \nincluding even churches. Rheims Cathedral still has a carved stone \npanel showing the lightning-struck Tower with the two male figures \nfalling from its blasted crown. 44 An engraved Horoscope wheel manu- \nfactured at Niirnberg in 1515 placed seven of the Major Arcana \npictures in various zodiacal positions. 45 The figures of the World, the \nWheel of Fortune, Justice, the Fool, and Death the skeletal Grim \nReaper with his scythe were common illustrations of the medieval \nZeitgeist; but no one knows whether they were copied from the \nTarot, or the card pictures were copied from them. \n\nJust before the card of Death came the card perhaps most \ncharacteristic of the Tarot alone: the Hanged Man, who "cannot be \nfound in any orthodox Christian symbology, and is one of the clearest \nindications that the Tarot trumps were designed to illustrate some \nnon-Christian system of belief." 46 The Hanged Man hung on a door- \nshaped gallows such as Norse pagans called the Wooden Horse, or \nthe Horse of Odin. 47 Even though the figure of Death immediately \nfollowed him, it was only a symbolic death. He hung, not by the \nneck, but by one foot: a custom known as "baffling," inflicted on \ndebtors and traitors in Germany, Italy, and Scotland. 48 Baffling was a \nformal humiliation, like a sojourn in the stocks, or like the mockery of \nsacred-king-victims (such as Jesus). Mystical initiations imitated such \nprocedures, so the novice "should empty himself completely, should be \nstripped of all his faculties, renouncing all his own predilections, his \nown thoughts, his own will in a word, his whole self." 49 The Hanged \nMan\'s number, 12, recalled the famous Twelfth Rune sacred to \nOdin the Hanged God, the rune by which hanged victims could be \nmade to speak, and reveal the mysteries of the death- world. 50 \n\nThe mystic revelation following the Hanged Man\'s encounter \nwith Death was the female figure of Temperance, copied from magic \ntexts that showed the Goddess Isis with one foot on land, the other in \nwater, revealing her dominion over both elements. 51 This Temper- \nance angel poured water from one jar into another, recalling the \n\n\n\n984 \n\n\n\nsymbolic merging of Isis and Osiris in the Amulet of the Two Jars, an Tartarus \n\nancient Egyptian charm of eternal life. 52 Similarly in India, the revela- \ntion of divine love was a merging of God and Goddess "like the ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \npouring of water into water." 53 One of the incarnations of the God \nhimself was a water jar, just as Babylonian, Egyptian, and Cabirian \nsavior-deities were symbolized by water jars in their holy processions, as \nwas Jesus also, according to Luke 22:10. In the Far East, the vessel of \nwater was regarded as the residence of the deity. 54 Moreover, this same \nWater-Jar-Savior appeared in Hindu playing cards at the head of the \nsuit of Jars, which corresponded to the Tarot suit of Cups. 55 \n\nThus the European Tarot seemed to show a man symbolically \ndying, and meeting a manifestation of the Goddess as a result. This \nmeeting or merging, "like the pouring of water into water," prefigured \nthe final meeting with the cosmic Mother upon actual death the \nLast Trump just as a man\'s sexual union with his earthly Shakti \nprefigured his union with the ultimate Shakti of the spirit realm, Kali \nherself. Small wonder then that patriarchal Christians regarded the \nTarot as a Bible of heresy comprehensible to the illiterate, at a time \nwhen even literate laymen were officially forbidden to read their own \nBible. 56 The Oriental origin of its heretical Tantric/Gnostic imagery \nis suggested by the Slavic word for a "reader" of the cards: Vedavica, \nliterally a Vedic seer. 57 Small wonder that some of the bishops and \ncardinals tried to collect packs of cards and burn them, as was done in \nNiimberg in 1452. 58 Cards became harmless to the church only after \ntheir religious symbols were removed and their meanings forgotten, so \nthey were mere "games" ludicrous, in the new interpretation of the \nold pagan ludiox "sacred games." To Hebrew patriarchs also, naipes, \n"cards," became naibi, "sorcery." 59 \n\n1. A. Douglas, 21. 2. Cavendish, T., 18. 3. A. Douglas, 20. 4. Trigg, 47. \n\n5. Funk, 320. 6. Hazlitt, 460. 7.

A cruel overlord ordered Tell to shoot an apple from \nhis son\'s head with an arrow to prove his skill. Tell performed the feat \nsuccessfully, holding a second arrow which he said would have slain the \noppressor, had the junior Tell been injured. \n\nThe same tale was told earlier of the Rhineland archer-wizard \nnamed Puncker (Marksman), ordered by Prince Eberhard Long- \nbeard to shoot a penny off his son\'s head. Puncker too held a second \narrow, saying if he failed the test, the second arrow would have \npenetrated Longbeard\'s heart. 1 \n\nIn the 12th century, Saxo Grammaticus told the same story about \nToki, a Danish archer-wizard forced by King Harald Bluetooth to \nshoot an apple from his son\'s head. The same incident occurred in the \nmythical history of Egil, brother of Velundr, in the Saga of Thidrick. \nAnother Norse hero, Eindridi, was obliged to shoot a writing-tablet off \nhis son\'s head. Another, Hemingr, had to throw a spear at a hazel nut \non the head of his brother Bjorn. The Faroe Island archer-wizard was \nGeyti, whom King Harald commanded to shoot a hazel nut from his \nbrother\'s head. \n\nAll the stories may have come from an ancient Persian poem, the \nMantic Uttair, or Language of Birds, by Farad-Uddin Attar. One of \nits most widely repeated stories told of a king who shot an apple from \nthe head of a beloved page boy. 2 \n\n1. Kramer & Sprenger, 151. 2. Baring-Gould, C.M.M.A., 119-25. \n\n\n\nTeraphim \n\nOld Testament household fetishes, said by Hosea to be essential to \nworship (Hosea 3:4). A Hebrew commentator said the teraphim were \nancestral ghosts, in the form of mummified oracular heads. 1 Their \nname means "children of Terah." The Bible says Terah "begat" \nAbraham; but the word translated "begat" often meant "gave birth \nto," and many of the so-called patriarchs in the Pentateuch are feminine \n\n\n\n987 \n\n\n\nTerra Rrma names. If Abraham was the same as Ab-Brahm or Father Brahma, his \n\nTetragrammaton parent would have been the Goddess Tara, a universal name of Mother \n\n^ m Earth. \n\nThe Jews\' teraphim were similar to the Romans\' lares or manes, \nalso ancestral spirits residing in relics. Like the worshippers of \nteraphim, African natives still believe a dead ancestor\'s spirit can inhabit \nan effigy especially if the effigy contains physiological relics like \nbones, teeth, hair, etc. and by consulting such an idol one can \ncommunicate directly with the ancestor. 2 \n\nThere were many Middle-Eastern peoples whose habit it was to \npreserve skulls of the dead for later necromantic consultation, espe- \ncially the skulls of sacred kings. Their place of sacrifice called Golgotha, \nalleged scene of Jesus\'s crucifixion, meant "the place of skulls." \n\n1 . Graves, W.G., 1 64. 2. de Lys, 43 1 . \n\n\n\nTerra Firma \n\nTitle of Mother Earth, taken from the Homeric phrase "Great \nMother, Firmly Founded, Oldest of Divinities." To the Greeks she was \nGaea the Deep-Breasted One, who ruled Mount Olympus before \nthe coming of the Hellenic gods. See Tara. \n\n\n\nTetragrammaton \n\nLiterally, "four-letter word," the secret name of God in Hebrew \nletters yod-he-vau-he (YHWH); often confused with God\'s introduc- \ntion of himself to Moses, "I Am That I Am" (Exodus 3:14). This \nintroduction was borrowed from the god Ab-braham or Father Brahma, \nwho introduced himself in Sanskrit Tat Sat "I Am That that Is." \' \n\nThe root of YHWH is the radical HWH, he-vau-he, which meant \n"being" or "life" or "woman" interchangeable concepts in the \nancient Middle East. 2 The same letters in Latin are E-V-E: Eve. 3 Thus \nthe so-called inner meaning of the Tetragrammaton was really Eve, \nMother of All Living, the real creator of the world and mother of Adam, \naccording to Gnostic scriptures. 4 \n\nThe Tetragrammaton had two versions. The lesser-known one \nwas EHYH, a feminine principle derived from Hayya (another of \nEve\'s names), designating the Goddess in her special connection with \nwomen in childbed. On Samaritan phylacteries the masculine and \nfeminine versions of the Tetragrammaton were intertwined. 5 \n\nMedieval writers who didn\'t know the meaning of Tetragramma- \nton often took it for the name of a powerful demon, and invoked it in \nmagic charms. A 17th-century writer declared that "the mighty Tetra- \ngrammaton" was a devil who protected witches. 6 Other authorities \n\n\n\nsaid Tetragrammaton was one of the more powerful secret names of Teutatis \n\nGod, used to control demons when they were invoked. (See Name.) Thais, Saint \n\nJewish mystics used the Tetragrammaton extensively in the lore of ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nthe Cabala. YHWH was called the Divided Name, "considered to \ncontain all the Forces of Nature." Since the holy name could be divided \ninto that of Mother Eve (HWH), and that of the "I" or jod for \nJehovah, it suggested the cabalistic doctrine of God\'s loss of his Shekina, \nthe Great Mother, whose return the mystics believed essential to the \nachievement of peace in the universe. \n\nSometimes the Tetragrammaton was called Sem ha-mephoras, or \nSchemahamphorasch, probably the origin of the word "semaphore" \nin the sense of a word-sign like the Hindu samjna? Rabbinic tradition \nsaid the Sem ha-mephoras either was inscribed on a holy phallic stone \nburied in the Great Gate of Mother Earth, or else was the stone itself, \nalso called Eben stijjah, the Stygian Stone, or Stone of the Deeps. It \nwas connected with the sexual myth of the descent of Father Heaven\'s \nphallus into the yoni of the virgin Mother Earth, to "unlock her \nfountains," that is, to stimulate the Nether Upsurge of world-sustaining \nblood. Sexual organs of God and Goddess lay at the center of the \nholy of Holies. "David is supposed to have found at the digging of the \nfoundation of the temple, the Eben stijjah, Stone of the Deeps, that \nunlocked the fountain of the great deep, and on which the Sem ha- \nmephoras, the outspoken name of God, was inscribed." 8 \n\n1.

To fulfill what seemed to be one of the ascetics\' favorite \nfantasies, Thais at the height of her beauty and fame was said to have re- \nnounced her sins, mortified her flesh, burned her fine clothes and \nornaments, given away all her wealth to the church, and walled herself \nup in a desert cell to live in the midst of her own filth. 1 The only trou- \nble with the hagiographer\'s tale was that, at the time it was supposed to \n\n\n\n989 \n\n\n\nThalassa \nThemis \n\n\n\nhave happened, Thais had already been dead for more than 600 \nyears. \n\nl.Aftwatcr, 320. \n\n\n\nThalassa \n\nThe Goddess at Rhodes and Miletus, mother of the Telchines \n("enchanters").

In the 4th \ncentury it was attended by a group called Apotactics, under a female \n"deacon," subsequently declared heretical. 2 Some Christians asserted \nthat St. Thecla was Diana\'s priestess. 3 Others, like Tertullian, knew \nshe was nothing but an epithet of the Great Goddess. Tertullian denied \nthe legend connecting Thecla with St. Paul, calling it a lie invented \nby a misguided church elder "for love of St. Paul" a curious explana- \ntion, hinting that Paul might have been honored by the connection. 4 \n\nl.Attwater,321. 2.

Her Virgin aspect was Artemis (Ar-Themis); her name \nwas numerically equivalent to that of the moon. 1 Her children were \nThemistes, "oracles." She founded the oracle of Delphi ("Womb"), \nlong before it was taken over by Apollo. \n\nBlack Sea Amazons worshipped Themis in the form of a black \nstone on their sacred island of Themiscyra, "Divine Themis." The \nRoman Forum had an ancient black stone, the Lapis Niger, engraved \nwith the Goddess\'s sacred law. 3 In faraway Iceland the same Goddess \nwas adored in the form of a stone called Spamathr, "Mother of \nProphecy," or Armathr, "Mother of Prosperity." 4 \n\nTo the Egyptians, Themis was "Temu," spirit of the fertile Abyss \nthat gave birth to all things in the beginning. \n\n\n\n990 \n\n\n\nClassic myth made Themis the spirit of the post-diluvian creation. \nAfter the Flood receded, Themis taught the survivors Deucalion and \nPyrrha how to repopulate the earth by magic. They were to fling "the \nbones of their mother" behind them as they walked. On resolving the \nriddle, they understood that Themis meant stones, the bones of their \nMother Earth. 5 By the grace of the Goddess, new human beings rose \nup from these stones. \n\n1.

The weakness of theol- \nogy as a "science" is its lack of objective proof for any of its claims. \nVetter points out that any theologian in the modern age is likely to be \nconfused and worried: "He is trying to reconcile science with faith \nand dogma, and they are simply not to be reconciled." 1 \n\nSince Galileo\'s time, Christian theology has been concerned not \nwith justifying God\'s ways to man but with justifying God\'s ways to \nscience. This is usually done by reasoning backward from religion\'s \ngiven conclusions to theoretical causes. In 1952, Pope Pius XII \ndemonstrated this in an astonishing series of non sequiturs to force \n"science" to prove the existence of God: \n\nWhat significance, then, has modern science for the proof of the existence \nof God, which depends on the fact that the cosmos is susceptible of \nchange? . . . From the fact that there is change we may conclude that \nthere is an Absolute Being whose nature is unchangeable. . . . [Science] \nhas, with the concreteness that belongs to physical proof, confirmed the \nprinciple of contingency and the conclusion based on it that . . . the \ncosmos came into being by the hand of the Creator. 2 \n\nOnly theology could make such a long, loose-jointed leap from \nthe fact that there is change to a "conclusion" that something un- \nchangeable must exist. Needless to say, science has not confirmed \nany such thing as the theological principle of contingency with any \n"physical proof"; theologians simply don\'t understand what physical \nproof consists of. \n\nTheological problems are not solved by physical evidence but by \nadjustment of verbal definitions. The usual method is debate. Medi- \neval Schoolmen earnestly debated such questions as how many angels \ncould dance on the head of a pin, or whether the earth hung from \nheaven by a golden chain or an iron one. "Evidence" was taken from \nanalogy. For instance, Peter Lombard\'s rules on incest said it was all \nright to marry outside the sixth degree of consanguinity because there \nwere six ages of the world. In 1215 the fourth Lateran Council \n\n\n\nPeter Lombard Ec- \nclesiastical teacher of \nthe 1 2th century, \nbishop of Paris, author \nof many sermons, \ncommentaries on scrip- \nture, and theological \ntreatises known as the \nBooks of Sentences. \n\n\n\n991 \n\n\n\nTheology declared it was even all right to marry outside the fourth degree of \n\nconsanguinity, because there were four humors in the body and four \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ elements in the universe. 3 \n\nMost of the time, theology and science have been implacable \nenemies. 1 The aggression has been on the side of theology, not \nscience; the latter simply pursues facts, the former attacks facts because \nthey threaten orthodox fantasies. \n\nThe priesthoods of whatever stripe can never live down, nor make amends \nfor, their disgraceful role in retarding the development of modern \nscience during the past millenium in Christendom. But what is even \nworse, they seem to have learned nothing from that defeat and are now \nclosing ranks, better to fight the same sort of a battle in the area of the \nsocial sciences and ethics. . . . [S]upernaturalism is, in its social func- \ntions and consequences, a dangerous opiate. And, what is perhaps even \nworse, it discourages objective attempts at intelligent social trial-and- \nerror, planning, and even research, and undermines man s faith in his own \nresources. . . . \n\nThe methods and principles of the theologians are still the same; \nthey have merely abandoned certain fields as no longer profitable for \nexploitation and have concentrated their efforts in the psychological and \nsociological, derived out of a distant past. Their sole claim to validity \ntoday derives from the extent of their social acceptability, not from any \nempirical validation. To preserve that social acceptability organized \nreligion bends its every effort to keep "controversial" topics out of public \neducational institutions and to provide as much parochial education as \npossible for as many of the "faithful" as possible. s \n\nTo provide the kind of education defined as Christian, it has \nbeen necessary for theologians to lie, and then to find words that call \ntheir lies morally right. Such semantic wriggling is shown by a book \nfor Catholic laymen by Edwin F. Healy, S.J., published in I960 under \nthe rather astonishing title of Mora] Guidance. \n\nAt times one is obliged in conscience to veil the truth, for there are secrets \nto be guarded and detractions to be avoided. Sometimes silence will not \nsuffice to maintain the secret which one is trying to guard. In fact, it may \nhappen that silence would betray the secret. Hence there must be some \nlicit means of concealing the truth when necessary. This licit means is the \nbroad mental reservation. . . . One way of putting the question is to ask \nif a false statement is always a lie. Some theologians answer in the \nnegative. . . . Sometimes it is necessary to make a false statement in \norder to protect secret knowledge. Silence or the use of mental reservation \nis not sufficient; the only way to protect the secret is to make a \nstatement contrary to what you know to be true. 6 \n\nIn direct ideological descent from Eusebius who extolled "holy lying" \nfor the church\'s sake, Healy makes "licit" every form of falsehood. \nChurchmen themselves seldom believed the lies they told, or al- \nlowed, as shown by the 19th-century clergymen\'s aphorism: "He may \nhold anything who holds his tongue." 7 The theologian Beausobre \nwrote: \n\n\n\n992 \n\n\n\nChurchmen not only do not say what they think, but they do say the Theotokos \n\ndirect contrary of what they think. Philosophers in their cabinets; out of \n\nthem they are content with fables, though they well know they are fables. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nNay, more: they deliver honest men to the executioner, for having \n\nuttered what they themselves know to be true. How many atheists and \n\npagans have burned holy men under the pretext of heresy? Every day \n\ndo hypocrites consecrate, and make people adore the host, though as well \n\nconvinced as I am, that it is nothing but a bit of bread. 8 \n\nPerhaps the most dangerous truth, about which theologians \nalways lied, was the one advanced by the Arab philosopher Averroes: \nthat all religions are of equal validity or nonvalidity, because all are \nmerely human productions. 9 Judeo-Christian tradition could not bear \nthis idea, for it taught that not only were its scriptures directly dictated \nby God but its religion was the only "right" one even though shaped \nand supported by false statements. \n\nHow could the modern church acknowledge, Guignebert asks, \n"that religion lives its whole life in the consciousness of men and that \nhuman consciousness has changed since the thirteenth century?" \nOrthodoxy must believe itself immutable, but it is always embarrassed \nby the records of its mistakes. Renan says, "There is one thing that a \ntheologian can never be, and that is a historian. History is necessarily \ndisinterested. . . . The theologian has one interest, his dogma. If this \ndogma be trimmed down as much as ever it can be, then it is still for the \ncritical mind an unbearable load. The orthodox theologian may be \ncompared to a bird in a cage; all real movement is forbidden to it." 10 \n\nThe conclusion that theology once found unthinkable is becoming \nmore and more thinkable. "What gods are there, what gods have \nthere ever been, that were not from man\'s imagination? " \' \' To insist on \ndeities in the real world, the theologian must resort to intellectual \ndishonesty. "One should claim as knowledge only what he really knows, \nand admit that he does not know what he doesn\'t know. The \ncharacteristic Western ardor for answering the unanswerable would be \nmore uplifting if it did not entail claims of certitude." n Morton \nSmith points out that "When a theologian talks of a \'higher truth,\' he is \nusually trying to conceal a lower falsehood." 1B \n\nl.Vetter,257. 2.

Women mixed the seed corn with their \n\nmenstrual blood to give it life; sacrificed pigs; and carried in proces- \nsion seed vessels, serpents, and cakes formed like female genitals. 1 On \nthe third day, sacrificed victims came forth from the earth-womb in \nthe Kalligeneia, "Fair Birth." 2 Victims were identified with the savior \nDionysus, a Holy Child laid in a manger, later to die and give his \nblood as sacred wine for the worshippers to drink, thus assuring their \nimmortality. \n\n1. Spretnak, 269. 2. Encyc. Brit, "Thesmophoria." \n\n\n\nThomas Rhymer \n\nThomas Learmont, also known as Thomas of Erceldoune, a 14th- \ncentury Scottish poet-seer. Erceldoune (now Earlston) was "Ercel\'s \nDown," seat of the Saxon Goddess Ercel, or Ursel, or Horsel, the \n"Fairy Queen" who loved Thomas and taught him secrets of magic. \nThomas was accosted on Huntlie Bank by the incumbent Queen of \nElphame, an earthly incarnation of the Goddess, who taught him the \nsecrets of the witch cult and re-baptized him as True Thomas when \nhe had renounced Christianity. 1 \n\nAccording to "The Ballad of Thomas Rhymer," the Fairy Queen \nshowed Thomas three roads: one leading to heaven, a second to hell, \nand a third to "fair Elf-land," that is, a Way that was neither Christian \nnor anti-Christian. Along the third road he came to the River of \nBlood, comparable to the Greeks\' birth-river Styx, or the river of \ngiantesses\' menstrual blood, crossed by the god Thor on his way to \nthe land of elder deities. Here Thomas entered a very mysterious place: \n"For forty days and forty nights / He wade thro\' red blude to the \nknee, / And he saw neither sun nor moon, / But heard the roaring of the \nsea." 2 \n\nThe legend suggests a Tantric sort of enlightenment, brought \nabout by communion with female life-essence. The Fairy Queen \nstated that she had "claret wine" in her lap and invited Thomas to lay \nhis head there. The original meaning of "claret" was perception, or \nenlightenment. In common English usage, claret was also a synonym \nfor blood. In Celtic myth, the Fairy Queen offered "red mead" \nwhich was also herself, Mab (Mead). 5 The Norse version of Thomas \nwas Sir Bosmer, who swam the "eddying flood" to the Elf-Queen as \nshe stood on the far bank, saying, "Welcome, Sir Bosmer! Come home \nto me, I\'ve brewed the mead and the wine for thee." 4 Such tales tend \nto confirm clergymen\'s insistence that menstrual blood was the \ncommunion wine of witches. \n\nAfter Thomas\'s journey to the secret paradise, where he remained \nseven years recalling the seven windings of the Styx he became a \n\n\n\n994 \n\n\n\ngreat wizard, poet, and prophet, ranked with such sages of the old faith \nas Merlin and Tristan. 5 \n\n1.

Brit., "Thomas the Rhymer." \n\n\n\nThomas, Saint \nThor \n\n\n\nThomas, Saint \n\nHellenized name of the god Tammuz, traditional Dying Savior of \nthe Jerusalem cult (Ezekiel 8:14), whose rites were supplanted by those \nof Jesus. Tammuz then became Doubting Thomas, challenging \nJesus\'s claim to authentic apotheosis and resurrection in the flesh. He \nrefused to believe in his rival\'s return from death until he had probed \nhis wounds. Then, Thomas-Tammuz announced his acceptance of \nJesus as "my Lord and my God" (John 20:28) or so the Gospel \nwould have it. \n\nThe story of Doubting Thomas appears only in the so-called \nGnostic Gospel of John, written more than 1 50 years after Jesus\'s \npurported lifetime. 1 Its purpose was to press Christian claims to superi- \nority over the old deities. \n\nThomas the doubter-turned-convert was also Thomas the twin: \nChristian legends admitted that Jesus and Thomas-Tammuz had the \nsame face and were really the same god. According to some sources, the \nrival\'s name was Judas Thomas, or Judas the Tammuz, whose face \nwas the same as Jesus\'s face. 2 Judas and Jesus seem to have been \ntraditional names taken by victims in whom the god Tammuz was \nincarnate. \n\nDuring the 4th century, a shrine at Edessa was taken over by \nfollowers of the new Tammuz now called St. Thomas, Apostle to \nIndia and the usual phony relics were installed. 3 \n\nl.Enslin, L.C.M.,451. 2.

Thor had at least six major \nsanctuaries in England; Thurstable in Essex was originally "Thor\'s \nPillar." Thor\'s cult persisted up to the 1 1th century when a Christian \nchronicler said Thor or his priest was "a wicked man of Kent" \nacting as the king\'s counselor. Saxons converted to Christianity were \nobliged to renounce "Thunaer, Woden and Saxnot, and all those \ndemons who are their companions." x \n\nYet Thor continued to be worshipped in the north. His sanctuary \nat Maerin in Trondheim was still active in the 1 1th century. 2 Eligius, \nbishop of Noyons, scolded Christians for observing Thursday as the \nholy day of Thor in the 7th century; yet even 500 years later, Thor\'s \n\n\n\nvar. Thundr, Thunaer, \nDonar \n\n\n\n995 \n\n\n\nThoth \nThugs \n\n\n\nhammers were still revered in temples as sacred relics and sources of \nthunder. In Prussia up to the 16th century, Jupiter-Thor was wor- \nshipped by the people in "sacred woods in which they made sacrifices \nand sacred springs which Christians were not allowed to approach." 3 \n\nThor apparently descended from the Middle-Eastern thunder-bull \nwho was also Jupiter. Plutarch said the Phoenician thunder god was \nThur, the bull. 4 The Germanic Thor "bellowed like a bull" as he \nswung his hammer. 5 Like other forms of the bull god, he was married \nto the Earth Goddess as Thrud, "Power" or "Strength." 6 Though late \nmyths sometimes called Thrud his "daughter," Thor\'s home in \nAsgard belonged to her. It was called Thrudvangar, "Thrud\'s Field." 7 \n\n1. Turville-Petre, 99-100. 2. Oxenstierna, 294. 3. H.R.E. Davidson, G.M.V.A., 81-87. \n4. Knight, S.L., 20. 5. Lamusse, 261. 6.

His \nholy city was known as Hermopolis, "City of Hermes." Priests of \nHermopolis pretended that Thoth had created the world, either by \nhatching the World Egg (which he encircled in the form of the \nGnostic Serpent), or by speaking the words of creation, after the \nmanner of the biblical God. (See Logos; Ur-Text.) The Book of \nThoth was a famous legendary work supposed to reveal the secrets of \nmanipulating matter by verbal charms. \n\nLike Hermes and other manifestations of the Wise Serpent, Thoth \nowed his powers to his former close association with the Great \nMother. He was lunar in nature, rather than solar. When he ascended \nto heaven, he became the guardian of the Moon gates. 1 \n\n1 . Larousse, 27. \n\n\n\nThugs \n\nThe curious ritual-murder cult of Thuggee flourished in central India \nfor some three centuries, until the advent of railroads decreased foot \ntravel in the 1800s so that the depredations of Thuggee "highway- \nmen" declined. \n\nThugs were fanatical worshippers of the Goddess Kali, having \ndeveloped the idea that killing men in her name would win them a \nprivileged reincarnation. They preyed on her enemies, the Brahmans. \nWomen had nothing to fear from the Thugs; their victims were only \nmen. 1 \n\nThuggee legend said Kali once tried to destroy all the "demons of \nblood and seed" (men) created by male gods. But each time she \nbeheaded one, another man sprang up from every drop of spilled blood, \nprobably a remnant of the belief that spilled blood in the Goddess\'s \n\n\n\n996 \n\n\n\nsanctuary brought forth increased fertility. At last Kali wiped the sweat \nfrom her arms with a handkerchief, gave the handkerchief to her \nfaithful followers, and told them to make it into cords to strangle the \n"demons" without bloodshed. \n\nMale human sacrifices were still offered to Kali up to the 16th \ncentury a.d., and occasionally even later, decapitation being the \nmethod of choice. A boy was beheaded at Kali\'s altar in Tanjore every \nFriday at sunset. 2 A king of Cooch Behar offered a hundred and fifty \nmen to Kali at Danteshvari in the 1 500s, and a king of Bastar sacrificed \ntwenty-five men at the same shrine in 1830. Human sacrifice was \nprohibited and replaced by animal sacrifice in 1835. \n\nLike medieval Arabian Assassins, the Thugs maintained that the \nrites of their Goddess should continue, and the Brahmans were \nheretics who deserved extermination. The Mahabharata presents Kali as \na spirit of Brahmanicide, "with teeth projecting terribly, of an aspect \nfuriously contorted, tawny and black, with disheveled hair, appalling \neyes, and a garland of skulls around her neck, bathed in blood, clad in \nrags and the bark of trees." 3 This probably represented a primitive idol \nof the Death-goddess whose devotees believed she must be bathed in \nblood to remain fertile and satisfied. \n\n1.

According to the Katha \nUpanishad, "That being, of the size of a thumb, dwells deep within \nthe heart. He is the lord of time, past and future." The belief was literal. \nThe sages actually thought a thumb-sized manikin danced inside the \nheart, stamping out the heartbeat, just as Dancing Shiva stamped out \nthe rhythm of the universe as he perpetually danced within the \ncosmic body of his consort. The crudity of the original belief now has to \nbe glossed over by modern commentators, who don\'t want their \nancient traditions to seem absurd. So the pious scholar writes, "The \nsages ascribe a definite, minute size to the Self in order to assist the \ndisciple in meditation." ! \n\nStill, the thumb-sized soul passed into European folklore and \nemerged as Hop-O\'-My-Thumb and the fairy Thumbelina, both of \nwhom probably began as disembodied souls in search of new bodies. \n\n1 . Upanishads, 2 1 , 24. \n\n\n\nUpanishads Buddhist \nscriptures representing \nthe final stage in Vedic \nthought, dealing with \nthe philosophy known \nas Vedanta. The Katha \nUpanishad discusses \ntransmigration of souls, \nthe nature of eternal \nlife, the doctrine of \nmaya, and an account \nof a visit to Yama, Lord \nof the Dead. \n\n\n\nThyrsus \n\nRod and staff of Dionysus, a wand or scepter tipped with a pine cone, \nrepresenting the god\'s power to fertilize. The thyrsus was borne by the \n\n\n\n997 \n\n\n\nTiamat \n\n\n\ngod himself, by his satyrs, his Maenads, his sileni, and other partici- \npants in his sacred orgia. Sometimes the thyrsus was displayed in \nconjunction with a wine cup, forming a male-and-female combina- \ntion like that of the royal scepter and orb. 1 \n\n1. Lamusse, 153. \n\n\n\nTiamat \n\nSumero-Babylonian "Goddess Mother" (Dia Mater), from whose \nformless body the universe was born at creation; personification of The \nDeep, or Tohu Bohu. Babylonians later claimed their municipal god \nMarduk, Tiamat\'s son, divided her into heavens above and earth below, \nas did Marduk\'s imitator, the biblical God. But the original division \nwas made by the Mother herself, as in the ancient Pelasgian myth of her \nAegean counterpart, Eurynome. 1 \n\nIn derivative Hebrew myths, Tiamat became Tehom, The Deep; \nand this is how she appears in the Bible (Genesis 1:2). Patriarchal \nwriters forgot that "The Deep" was a personified womb, a Middle- \nEastern version of Kali whose being before creation was "formless." \nMost creation myths incorporated the idea of formlessness, in the \ndarkness before the birth that brought "light" and the splitting of the \nMother\'s body, so she became both heaven and earth. The Bible\'s \naccount is based on the same archetype. \n\nIn Egypt, Tiamat was Temu or Te-Mut, oldest of deities, mother \nof the archaic Ennead of four dual female elements: Water, Dark- \nness, Night, and Eternity. 2 She was also Nun, Naunet, or Ma-Nu, the \ngreat fish who gave birth to the universe and the gods. In repeated \ncycles of becoming, she periodically swallowed up both gods and \nuniverses and gave them rebirth like Kali. 5 \n\nTiamat\'s firstborn child seems to have been a duplicate of herself, \nMummu, translated either "churning" or "mother." The combina- \ntion recalled the ancient notion that solid earth was made from \n"churning" the primordial fluid, like making butter from milk. 4 Some \nmyths gave Tiamat a male consort, Apsu, similar to Jupiter Pluvius: a \nFather Heaven whose job it was to fertilize the Mother\'s abyss with \nseminal rain. But he was not her superior, not even her equal. Even in \nthe chaotic conditions before creation, Tiamat was the true source of \nlife. Her consort was subordinate, not even very necessary. 5 Various \nmyths said Tiamat alone produced the fluid of creation, which was \nnot semen but her menstrual blood, flowing continuously for three years \nand three months. 6 Its great reservoir was the Red Sea comparable \nto Kali\'s "ocean of blood" the eastern shore of which is still called \nTihamat by the Arabs. \n\nBabylonians said their god Marduk divided his mother Tiamat into \ntwo parts, upper waters and lower waters. Likewise, the Jewish God \n\n\n\n998 \n\n\n\n"divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters Tiamat \n\nwhich were above the firmament" (Genesis 1:7). The Jewish God \n\nalso divided the Red Sea, which was likened to Tiamat herself. ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe idea of dividing waters was not original with the Jews. \nGoddesses did it before gods. The Hindu Goddess Bindumati, \n"Mother of Life," divided the waters of the Ganges. 7 The Goddess Isis \ndivided the waters of the river Phaedrus, to cross dry-shod. 8 Even an \ninsignificant Egyptian wizard named Zazamonkh divided the waters of \na lake to retrieve a courtesan\'s lost pendant. 9 Yahweh\'s miracle on \nbehalf of the Israelites was fairly common in contemporary lore. \n\nBy dividing Tiamat, Marduk established the Diameter (horizon), \nwhich was the Greek version of Tiamat\'s name, meaning Goddess- \nMother. We still say a diameter divides a whole circle. Though Marduk \nwas supposed to have slain his mother, the Ocean of Blood, he still \nmaintained the menstrual calendar in Babylon, celebrating sabbaths and \nmonths of the year according to the moon\'s phases. 10 \n\nModern scholars tend to ignore Tiamat\'s maternal Creatress \nnature, describing her as nothing more than a "dragon of chaos" slain \nby Marduk. It is seldom emphasized that this was a myth of matricide, \nor that the Goddess was the one who created the world. Some \ntraditions indicate that Marduk\'s murder of his mother may have been \nmotivated by jealously, like Cain\'s murder of Abel. Mother Tiamat \nhad overlooked Marduk and chosen another of her sons, Kingu, to be \nher consort and the king of the universe. \n\n[She] exalted among the gods, her sons, that she had borne, Kingu, and \nmade him greatest among them all . . . placed him on a throne, saying, \n"By my charm and incantation I have raised thee to power among the \ngods. The dominion over all the gods I intrusted to thee. Lofty thou \nshalt be, thou my chosen spouse; great be thy name in all the world. " She \nthen gave him the Tablets of Destiny, and laid them on his breast. " \n\nJealous Marduk not only killed Tiamat; he also deposed, castrat- \ned, and killed Kingu, and made the first man on earth out of Kingu\'s \nblood which tends to show that Kingu was once the name of the \nsacrificed god-king, whose blood had the "feminine" power to make \nlife. 12 Kingu was identified with the moon. Chaldeans called him Sin, \nthe Moon-god of Mount Sinai. Apparently he still had the tablets of the \nLaw given him by Tiamat (as Mother Rhea gave sacred tablets of the \nLaw to Minos on Mt. Dicte), for the Old Testament claims he passed \nthem on to Moses. \n\nIn southern Arabia, the Goddess was assimilated to Ishtar. The \neyes of her idol Tehama were said to flow with tears each year as she \nbewailed the death of Tammuz. 13 \n\nI. Graves, CM. 1, 27. 2. Budge, D.N., 21 1. 3.

The idea came from a \ngeneral Asiatic belief in cyclic recurrences brought about by the \nGoddess (Kali), herself the cauldron or sea of "infinite formlessness," \nholding all potential forms in a plastic state of flux. 1 She was the \nAbyss or the Deep before creation, according to the Bible (Genesis 1:2). \n\nChaldean sources of the Bible myth said the brooding creative \nspirit that brought order out of chaos was the Goddess; but patriarchal \nwriters transformed her into the "Spirit of God." 2 Tohu bohu was her \nsemi-fluid substance, menstrual blood in the process of clotting into \nsolidity; the sea, but also a sea of blood. Orphics called it "Chaos eternal, \nimmense, uncreated, from which all is born; neither darkness nor \nlight, nor damp nor dry, nor hot nor cold, but all things mingled, \neternally one and limitless." 3 Some scholars have identified tohu with \nthe Primordial Sea, the Goddess Tiamat (Hebrew Tehomet), and bohu \nwith the male earth god Behemoth, making "a sexual creation." 4 \n\nl.Avalon,229,233. 2.

(See Vagina Dentata.) \n\nAt the moment of her mating with Shiva, Kali Ma usually showed \na protruding tongue in token of the sexual sacrament. 1 The classic \nMedusa head signifying "female wisdom" also had a protruding tongue, \na reference to ancient sexual mysteries celebrated in her honor. 2 \n\nMedieval Christians understood very well that the protruding \ntongue was a sexual symbol. Their pictures of lusty devils showed \nlong phallic tongues, and sticking out the tongue "at" someone became \ntheir favorite gesture of insult, equivalent to "fuck you." In the east, \nwhere sexuality was not associated with shame or dishonor, sticking out \nthe tongue is still considered a polite greeting. \n\nItalians used to heighten the mouth\'s resemblance to a vulva by \ndrawing down one corner of it with the thumb. 3 Biting the thumb, a \nsupreme insult in Italy, cast a curse of castration. \n\nArchaic sacred kings, who had to kill their "fathers" or predeces- \nsors to win the queen, often castrated the defeated rival to deprive his \nghost of virtu (man-magic) which might give him enough power to \nreturn for revenge. This Oedipal attack was often mythologized as \nthe slaying of a dragon, symbol of "father," or "phallus bigger than \nmine." The dragon-slayer\'s reward was the woman (mother). Drag- \non-slaying heroes cut off the dragon\'s tongue, representing amputation \nof the penis. Tristan cut off the tongue of his slain dragon, to establish \nhis right to demand the hand of Iseult. 4 \n\nIn medieval cathedrals, "an extraordinary number of grotesque \nheads are depicted with protruding tongues," and this was distinctly \nrelated to exposure of sexual organs. "The exposure of the genitalia was \nwidely believed to thwart and keep at bay pursuing evil forces." 5 All \nover the Gothic cathedral, numerous creatures with their tongues \nsticking out showed once again that the cathedral was dedicated to a \npantheon of both Christian and pagan deities. People wanted their \n"creatures from the grotto" ox grotesques to inhabit the same \nchurches that were built over the sites of the old grottoes. By Renais- \nsance times, the old deities with their obscenely protruding tongues \nwere declared devils, so it became conventional to show devils making \nthis gesture. 6 \n\nThe story of Pinocchio\'s nose, which grew every time he told a lie, \n\nmay have originated in Oriental beliefs concerning the tongue. \n\nBuddhists said a liar\'s tongue would grow to great length in hell. 7 The \n\nBuddhists called "liars" most of the old non-Buddhist deities who \n\nstuck out their tongues in token of the sexual sacrament. \n\n1.

The previous source was probably the Egyptian Tephet, "Hid- \nden abode," a part of the underworld. 1 \n\nAt the Tophet altar, victims "passed through the fire to eternal \nlife," meaning they were burned to death and rose again as gods. For \na while, Molech was identified with Yahweh, which is why the sons of \nAaron were consumed on the altar by "fire from the Lord" (Leviti- \ncus 10:2). Norse heroes also passed through "magic fire" to reach the \nparadise of the Valkyries. Jewish surrogate-kings were still burned for \nthe Lord in Hilkiah\'s reign (2 Kings 23: 10). 2 \n\nLevite priests eventually distinguished Yahweh from Molech and \nforbade the latter\'s worship (Leviticus 18:21); but the cult of Hera- \ncles-Melkart still flourished in St. Paul\'s time in Paul\'s own home town \nof Tarsus. 3 Because victims burned in this "Tophet" were deified as \nholy martyrs, Paul thought there was a special magic in giving one\'s \nbody to be burned (1 Corinthians 1 3:3). \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 1,230. 2. James, 192. 3. H. Smith, 182. \n\n\n\nTorture \n\nDuring the Middle Ages, torture became the common accompani- \nment to legal cases involving matters of faith. Pagan common-law \ntraditions opposed the use of torture, and regarded an accused person \nas innocent until proven guilty by the prosecution. 1 Christian crusaders \nand inquisitors reversed this trend. (See Inquisition.) The Inquisi- \ntion\'s use of torture removed all possibility of proof of innocence. \nGibbon said, "No power under heaven could save the prisoner; he \nwas doomed." Weyer, an eyewitness, wrote that the inquisitors\' victims \nwere "slaughtered with the most refined tortures that tyrants could \ninvent, beyond human endurance. And this cruelty is continued until \nthe most innocent are forced to confess themselves guilty." 2 \n\nSurviving records, though scanty, paint a hideous picture of the \nInquisition\'s activities, which were sometimes disbelieved even by \nicontemporaries because they were unimaginable. A woman arrested at \nEichstatt in 1637 "laughed heartily" on the first day of her trial at the \nidea that she might have trafficked with the devil. She said she would \nrather die than accuse herself of such doings; she had lived a \njblameless life with her husband and eight children for more than 20 \nyears. Three weeks later, she died under the torture, confessing that \nhe was in love with the devil, that she killed one of her children at his \nbidding, and that at least 45 of her neighbors were fellow-Satanists. 3 \n\nNot even the most saintly had a chance against the inquisitors\' \nhngines. A 16th-century abbess of the convent of Santa Isabela at \n\n\n\n1003 \n\n\n\nTorture \n\n\n\nCordova, Magdalena de la Cruz, was a woman of "an extraordinary \nreputation for sanctity." Nevertheless she was accused and arrested, \nand soon confessed to practicing witchcraft with the help of two familia \ndemons, Balbar and Pithon. 4 \n\nThe inquisitors\' rule was to keep on torturing until the victim \nnamed many "accomplices," who were then arrested and tortured \nuntil more names were given, and so on until whole districts were foun \nto be "infected" with heresy. One woman told her confessor: "I \nnever dreamed that by means of the torture a person could be brought \nto the point of telling such lies as I have told. I am not a witch, and I \nhave never seen the devil, and still I had to plead guilty myself and \ndenounce others." One minister urged a condemned witch to re- \nnounce her accusations of innocent people, but she answered, "Father, \nlook at my legs! They are like fire ready to burn up so excruciat- \ning is the pain. I could not stand to have so much as a fly touch them, t< \nsay nothing of submitting again to the torture. I would a hundred \ntimes rather die than endure such frightful agony again. I cannot \ndescribe to any human being how terrific the pain actually is." 5 Such \ntorture was "extensively, viciously, and persistently used and could \nbreak all but the most heroic spirits." 6 \n\nWeyer served as a physician in witch prisons and spoke from first- \nhand knowledge of women driven half mad "by frequent torture . . . \nkept in prolonged squalor and darkness of their dungeons . . . and \nconstantly dragged out to undergo atrocious torment until they would \ngladly exchange at any moment this most bitter existence for death, are \nwilling to confess whatever crimes are suggested to them rather than \nbe thrust back into their hideous dungeon amid ever recurring torture.\' \nFriedrich von Spee, a Jesuit confessor who also worked in the prisons, \nwrote: "All recantation is vain. If she does not confess, the torture is \nrepeated twice, thrice, four times. In \'exceptional\' crimes, the \ntorture is not limited in duration, severity, or frequency. . . . She can \nnever clear herself. The investigating body would feel disgraced if it \nacquitted a woman; once arrested and in chains, she has to be guilty, by \nfair means or foul." 7 \n\nThis might be contrasted with the old law of the Ripuarian Franks \nthat any man who killed a woman for any reason whatever must pay a \nfine so heavy that it obligated his descendants for three generations. 8 \n\nMotherhood was a distinct liability for those who fell into inquisi- \ntors\' hands. Bodin recommended that children, if "craftily handled," \ncould be depended on to inform against their mothers. Children were \nalso highly susceptible to torture; so a rule was made that children \ncould be tortured at once, without any waiting period. Elicited by \ntorture or by craft, the testimony of "infants" meaning children \nunder 10 was acceptable to the Inquisition and could convict their \nmothers of witchcraft, even though such testimony was not accepted \nin other kinds of trials. 9 \n\nRules for the persecution of witches allowed no revocation of \n\n\n\n1004 \n\n\n\nconfessions after torture. Those who tried to retract their confessions Torture \n\nwere taken back to the torture chamber and tortured again; once to \n\npurge themselves of the retraction, and once again to elicit a "true" ^^^^^^^^^^^ m \n\nconfession. Any display of fear was proof of guilt. So was denunciation \nby another tortured victim. In 1 597 a 69-year-old woman named \nClara Geissler manage to resist the thumbscrew, but confessed every- \nthing she had been asked after racking and crushing of her feet. \nWhen those she named had been arrested and similarly tortured, Clara \nwas returned to the torture chamber to confirm their confessions. She \nwas tortured with "the utmost severity," and died. The record stated \nthat the devil had wrung her neck. 10 \n\nIn some cases of retracted confessions, the court automatically \nassumed that the confession was true, and the retraction a perjury. \nThe victim was then declared a relapsed impenitent, and handed over to \nthe stake. 11 \n\nInquisitors were instructed by their handbooks to give false prom- \nises of mercy for the sake of compliance and confession. 12 There was \nno need to keep any promises to an accused witch. If a victim confessed \neverything, abjured her heresy, and threw herself on the court\'s \nmercy, her sentence was carried out anyway, on two counts: (1) for the \n"temporal injuries" she had caused, and (2) for the worthlessness of \nher confession which was made "from fear of death" rather than from \ntrue repentance. 15 The same "worthless" confession, though, was a \nlegal basis for execution. \n\nDenial of guilt was useless, even if it could be maintained against \ntortures. Le Sieur Bouvet declared that "denial of guilt by a prisoner \nwas an especially good reason why torture should be continued." \nLimborch\'s History of the Inquisition said it was a simple matter to \nextort confession by torture from "such as are most innocent." Accord- \ning to Cornelius Loos, "Wretched creatures are compelled by the \nseverity of the torture to confess things they have never done, and so by \ncruel butchery innocent lives are taken and by a new alchemy gold \nand silver coined from human blood." Von Spee wrote, "The most \nrobust who have thus suffered have affirmed to me that no crime can \nbe imagined which they would not at once confess, if it would bring \never so little relief, and they would welcome ten deaths to escape a \nrepetition." H \n\nRecords of the Spanish Inquisition at Toledo show that some \nvictims were prevented from confessing until the lust of their tormen- \ntors had been gratified. Their torture went on for days or weeks beyond \nthe point where they had wholly broken down, and pleaded to be told \nwhat to say, so they could say it. 15 Such evidence shows that the \nInquisition really was a system of formalized sadism. The fact that the \nvast majority of its victims were women points to crypto-sexual motiva- \ntions engendered by repression on a massive scale. \n\nPope Alexander III said in an encyclical letter that confessions \nshould not be forced by torture. His successors took it upon themselves \n\n\n\n1005 \n\n\n\nTorture to explain that what Alexander really meant was that torture must not \n\nbe used against clergymen by lay persons; but it could be used by the \n\n^^^^^ clergy against laymen. When Innocent IV adopted torture for eccle- \n\n^ siastical trials, he said it should "stop short of loss of life or limb," but thi: \n\nwas a mere formality, since limbs were broken or crushed routinely in \nthe torture chamber. When a victim died under torture, inquisitors were \nauthorized by Pope Urban IV to absolve each other from guilt, to be \ninnocent in the sight of God. 16 \n\nMany semantic devices were used to convey an official impression \nthat the inquisitors were not monsters of cruelty. Records often said \nconfessions were given freely, sine tortura et extra locum torturae \n"without torture and even out of sight of the instruments of torture." \nThis meant that after the victims were tortured, they were carried into \nanother room and given the choice of confessing "freely" or being \ntaken back to the torture chamber. 17 \n\nWhen victims managed to kill themselves in prison, or died of thei \ninjuries, they were said to have been slain by the devil. One victim \nwho succeeded in cutting his own throat was described by Friar Guazzc \nas "tempted by a demon," which carried away his soul, "for so did \nDivine Justice dispose." 18 Few victims were allowed an opportunity to \nkill themselves, for they were closely chained at night; but they could \neasily be devoured by the rats and other prison-infesting vermin attract- \ned by the smell of blood and suppurating wounds. 19 \n\nMost victims pleaded for death sooner or later, but pious ones \nwere further tormented by visions of the hellfire that awaited them, \ndying with lies on their lips. A housewife named Rebecca Lemp ser \nletters from prison to her husband and six children, showing radical \nalterations in her attitude before and after torture. At first she was \nconfident: "My dearly beloved Husband, be not troubled. Were I to be \ncharged by thousands of accusations, I am innocent, else may all the \ndemons in hell come and tear me to pieces. Were they to pulverize me, \ncut me in a thousand pieces, I could not confess anything. Therefore \ndo not be alarmed; before my conscience and before my soul I am \ninnocent. Will I be tortured? I don\'t believe it, since I am not guilty \nof anything." \n\nAfter she had been tortured five times, and had confessed every \nenormity her tormentors suggested to her, Rebecca wrote again to \nher husband: "O thou, the chosen of my heart, must I be parted from \nthee, though entirely innocent? If so, may God be followed through- \nout eternity by my reproaches. They force one and make one confess; \nthey have so tortured me. . . . Husband, send me something that I \nmay die, or I must expire under the torture. . . . Send me something, \nelse may I peril even my soul." 20 \n\nAnother letter smuggled out of the Bamberg prison in 1628 was \nwritten by a man of means, Burgomaster Johannes Junius, whose \nproperty was taken by the inquisitors: \n\nMany hundred thousand good-nights, dearly beloved daughter Veronica. \n\n\n\n1006 \n\n\n\nInnocent have I come into prison, innocent have I been tortured, Torture \n\ninnocent must I die. For whoever comes into the witch prison must \n\nbecome a witch or be tortured until he invents something out of his ^^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\nhead and God pity him bethinks him of something. I will tell you how \n\nit has gone with me. . . . The executioner put the thumb screws on me, \n\nboth hands bound together, so that the blood ran out at the nails and \n\neverywhere, so that for four weeks I could not use my hands, as you \n\ncan see from the writing .... Thereafter they first stripped me, bound my \n\nhands behind me, and drew me up in the torture. Then I thought \n\nheaven and earth were at an end; eight times did they draw me up and let \n\nme fall again, so that I suffered terrible agony. The executioner said, \n\n"Sir, I beg you, for God\'s sake confess something, whether it be true or \n\nnot. Invent something, for you cannot endure the torture which you \n\nwill be put to, and even if you bear it all, yet you will not escape. "... \n\nNow, dear child, here you have all my confession, for which I must die. \n\nAnd they are sheer lies and made-up things, so help me God. For all this I \n\nwas forced to say through fear of the torture which was threatened \n\nbeyond what I had already endured. For they never leave off with the \n\ntorture till one confesses something; be he never so good, he must be a \n\nwitch. Nobody escapes. . . . Dear child, keep this letter secret so that \n\npeople do not find it, else I shall be tortured most piteously and the \n\njailers will be beheaded. So strictly is it forbidden. . . . I have taken several \n\ndays to write this; my hands are both lame. lam in a sad plight. Good \n\nnight, for your father Johannes Junius will never see you more. . . . Dear \n\nchild, six have confessed against me at once . . . all false, through \n\ncompulsion, as they told me, and begged my forgiveness in God\'s name \n\nbefore they were executed. 2 \' \n\nTorture was euphemistically called "the Question." Making a \nshow of mercy, handbooks of the Inquisition recommended that the \naccused be questioned at first "lightly, without shedding of blood." 22 \nSometimes this elicited full confessions. A witch in the diocese of \nConstance confessed to having raised a hailstorm by pouring water \ninto a small hole in the ground after she "had at first been exposed to \nthe very gentlest questions, being suspended hardly clear of the \nground by her thumbs." 25 \n\nOther methods, not quite so gentle, included the rack, thumb- \nscrew, bootscrew, whips, branding irons, pincers for twisting off \ngobbets of flesh, ropes to wind the extremities until blood spurted from \nunder the nails. A favorite of the judges was the hoist or strappado, a \npulley to haul the victim into the air by her arms bound behind her \nback, jerking her up and down until the shoulders were dislocated. \nThe water torture was also common. This consisted of forcing gallons of \nwater into the belly through a funnel put down the throat, sometimes \nalso forcing down and pulling up long strips of linen along with the \nwater, or paddling the distended belly with sticks. Feet or hands \nmight be basted with boiling fat and roasted over a brazier. 24 Most of the \ninstruments were inscribed with the pious motto: Soli Deo Gloria, \nGlory be only to God. 25 \n\nDr. Johann Meyfarth witnessed hundreds of witch trials in the \n\n\n\n1007 \n\n\n\nTorture 1 7th century and wrote that he would have given a thousand thalers \n\nto be able to forget what he had seen: "feet wrenched off legs, and eyes \n^^^^^^^^^ torn from their sockets, and the prisoner burned with brimstone and \n^ ^^^ m basted with oil. He had seen torturers apply flaming balls of brimstone to \nthe genitals of a woman while she was hanging in strappado. He had \nwatched them revel in horror until their victims confessed or died \n(strangled by the Devil, the judges explained)." 26 \n\nExecution was still another torture, sometimes miserably protract- \ned, as in Spain where half-burned heretics were snatched from the \nflames, still alive, and allowed to suffer for hours before being returned \nto the fire. At the "Witches\' Tower" in Hesse, victims were hung 1 5 \nfeet above ground in niches, and slowly baked to death over a low fire. \nNumerous burned bones and skulls were found buried at the base of \nthe tower. 27 Oddly enough, the tower later became the property of the \nnovelist Sacher-Masoch, who gave his name to the perversion known \nas masochism. 28 \n\nA significant detail, speaking psychologically, was that inquisitors \nseemed very anxious to make women cry. It was their rule that a \nwitch was proved guilty if she didn\'t shed tears during torture. The \njudge adjured her to weep, "by the loving tears shed by Christ on the \ncross." If she did weep, though, she went to the stake anyway, for it \nproved the devil had given her the gift of tears to mislead the \njudges. 29 If she didn\'t weep, she was convicted of "taciturnity," a crime \npunishable by burning. In England, the punishment for taciturnity \nwas peine fort et dure pressing to death. 30 \n\nEngland didn\'t import the engines of torture used on the conti- \nnent, but Scotland did. English witch-finders used informal or \nbloodless tortures like starvation, "swimming the witch," or "walking \nthe witch" (preventing her from sleeping until a confession was \nmade). 31 Various binding tortures were used. An accused witch might \nbe stripped and bound cross-legged on a table, sometimes with ropes \naround the neck attached to the four corners of the room, and left in \nthat position until she confessed. Sometimes, accused witches were so \ntightly manacled in jail while awaiting trial, that they came to the \ncourtroom with limbs rotted by gangrene. Many died of "gaol fever" \n(typhus) before they could be tried at all. \n\nSwimming the witch was a relic of the ordeal by water. With \nthumbs bound to the opposite big toes, the victim was lowered into a \nstream or pond by men holding ropes, one on each bank. If the body \nfloated, witchcraft was proved, on the theory that water rejected a \nwitch. If the body sank, the accused was innocent, although frequently \ndead of drowning. The decision was largely dependent on the men \nwho held the ropes. \n\nPeasant mobs often invented their own tortures for suspected \nwitches. At Catton in Suffolk in 1603, a mob of men tossed an 80- \nyear-old woman up in the air, punched her, flashed gunpowder in her \nface, and "having prepared a stool in the which they had stuck \n\n\n\n1008 \n\n\n\ndaggers and knives with sharp points upwards, they often times struck Torture \n\nher down upon the same stool whereby she was sore pricked and \n\ngrievously hurt." 32 ^^^^^im \n\n"Pricking" was the favorite technique of witch-finders who \nclaimed to locate the giveaway witch mark or "devil\'s mark" on a \nwitch\'s body by sticking a three-inch awl into her flesh. The devil\'s mark \nwas supposed to be a numb spot, so the pricking would produce no \npain. Most witch-finders used a trick instrument with a retractable blade, \nlike a stage dagger, to find the "painless" spot. 33 Scottish prickers \nformed a regular guild. Among the more famous of them were John \nBain, John Balfour, John Kincaid the "common pricker," and Mat- \nthew Hopkins, who pricked hundreds of old women in the country of \nSuffolk, and soon announced that the entire area was infested with \nwitches. 34 \n\nThe search for the mark was not necessarily definitive, if it failed. \nWhen the Bavarian witch-finder Jorg Abriel couldn\'t find the mark \non a woman, he simply said she looked like a witch to him, and went on \nto torture her into admitting it. 35 \n\nGrim Calvinist Scotland instituted tortures as nasty as the conti- \nnental ones, though the persecution was less, because the church \nmade no profit from it. Perhaps the most famous Scottish witch trial was \nconducted in the presence of King James VI (James 1 of England), \nwho was convinced the witches had caused a storm at sea that nearly \nwrecked his ship, and badly frightened him. The record said they had \ndone it by throwing a dead cat into the sea. They also set sail on the sea \nin a sieve. 36 \n\nThe alleged ringleader of the "coven" was Dr. John Fian, a \nschoolmaster, who displayed exemplary courage in the face of multi- \nple tortures, but his courage did him no good. "His nails upon all his \nfingers were riven and pulled off with an instrument called in Scottish \na turkas, which in England we call a pair of pincers, and under every \nnail there was thrust in two needles." He was subjected to "thrawing" \n(binding the head tightly with a rope), tongue-pricking, and three \nsessions in the boots. He "did abide so many blows in them, that his \nlegs were crushed and beaten together as small as might be, and the \nbones and flesh so bruised, that the blood and marrow spouted forth \nin great abundance, whereby they were made unserviceable for ever." 37 \nHe was carried to the stake on a cart. 38 \n\nThe memory of this martyr to superstition was sullied by a \nrather bawdy tale that arose after his death. Dr. Fian was said to have \ncraved the love of a village maiden, and bribed her brother to obtain \nthree of her pubic hairs for a love charm. The boy was caught by his \nmother, who substituted three hairs from a cow\'s udder. Dr. Fian \naccepted these and made his love charm, after which he was pursued \nthrough the village by a roaring, lovesick cow. 39 \n\nThrough its history, western civilization has been disgraced by \nspectacles of formalized infliction of pain upon the helpless. Such \n\n\n\n1009 \n\n\n\nTorture spectacles are even artificially contrived in modern "entertainment," \n\nsuch as films. G. B. Shaw remarked, "A public flogging will always \n____^^_^_ draw a crowd; and there will be in that crowd plenty of manifestations of \na horrible passional ecstasy in the spectacle of laceration and suffer- \ning."\' 40 Sometimes it was so blatant as to embarrass even participants. \nWhen Protestants abolished the bloody sport of bear-baiting in \nEngland, they gave as their reason not that it was cruel to bears and \ndogs, but that it afforded too much pleasure to the spectators. 41 \n\nAnimals and women were perennial victims, even equated with \none another by churchmen who claimed both were devoid of souls. \nAmong the most savagely tormented were women suspected of enjoy- \ning their sexuality witches, whores, adulteresses. The latter received \npublic floggings in colonial America: "Public whippings yielded a \nvicarious sexual experience a mixture of sadism and mass voyeur- \nism cloaked in righteous disapproval. . . . They gathered on such \noccasions to watch as a woman convicted of uncontrolled desire \nbared her back down to the waist and was whipped by a man with a kind \nof erotic violence later made notorious by the Comte de Sade." 42 \n\nWestern civilization came to choose pain over pleasure: to think \npain-giving permissible, fit for public display, even pious, whereas \npleasure-giving of the physical sort was suspect, hidden, "evil." The two \ntypes of behavior seem to be inversely related. If a society suppresses \none, the other will flourish. Studies with laboratory animals show that \nindividuals conditioned to be highly aggressive have below-normal \nsex drive and display little interest in copulation. It has also been \nobserved among human beings that angry, hostile individuals have \nlittle sexual appetite. 43 \n\nSexually repressed individuals abounded in western society, espe- \ncially in the church, which spawned the Inquisition. There were also \nless extreme manifestations of the evil. Doctors lauded the salutary \neffects of pain. Paullini\'s Flagellum Salutis ( 1 698) recommended \nsevere beatings for "quick and easy cures" of such disorders as melan- \ncholia, paralysis, toothache, sleepwalking, deafness, and \nnymphomania. Professor Cullen at Edinburgh taught that "stripes and \nblows about the body" help cure maniacs. John Battie, another expert \non the care of the insane, wrote: "Body pain may be excited to purpose \nand without the least danger. Beating is often serviceable." 44 \n\nAmong the most curious manifestations of western man\'s pain- \nobsession was its projection upon women as the givers of pain, almost \nas if man collectively sought punishment for his historical offenses \nagainst females. Flagellation was remarkably popular among Victori- \nan "puritans." Publisher George Cannon called flagellation "a letch \nwhich has existed from time immemorial, and is so extensively \nindulged in London at this day that no less than twenty splendid \nestablishments are supported entirely by its practice." 45 One writer \nsaid, "Lovers of the birch ... are almost as common as the lovers of \nVenus." 46 \n\n\n\n1010 \n\n\n\nBut it was Venus who wielded the birch: usually a mother image, Torture \n\nstepmother, aunt, governess, housekeeper, or a large, imposing sort \n\nof courtesan. Swinburne said, "One of the great charms of birching lies ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nin the sentiment that the floggee is the powerless victim of the furious \nrage of a beautiful woman." St. George H. Stock wrote: "When an \nelegant high bred woman wields the birch with dignity of mein and \ngrace of attitude, then both the practice and suffering becomes a real \npleasure." Dugdale published a pornographic book entitled Betsy \nThoughtless, "a most spicey [sic] and piquant Narrative of a Young Girl \nobliged to excoriate her sweetheart\'s bum before he could ravish her \nMaidenhead." 47 A typical passage of Victorian "spice" ran: \n\nMartinet meanwhile had taken off her loose morning wrapper, and armed \nherself with a rod, formed, not of canes and cuttings like the rest, but of \nstout birch stems with innumerable branches, like a tree in miniature. \nWith this weapon in her hand, how terrible she appeared! Juno \ndeprived of the apple might have looked like her. Her splendid neck and \narms were bare, her cheeks flamed, her huge breasts were heaving. \nSpeech was too weak, the graces of birching were ignored, nothing short \nof savage beating would satisfy her present need of vengeance. * 8 \n\nWas this a vision of woman wronged or Goddess ignored \nthrough centuries of oppression, surfacing in pornography which by \nits very simplicity may give expression to genuinely archetypal imag- \nery? These books were written by men, not women. They presented \nfantasies that men wanted to see in the mind\'s eye. In one porno- \ngraphic work, a young man was beaten for insulting his mother, by an \nolder woman presented as a "nurse" ordinarily, a nurturer or \ncaretaker. Her bizarre speech ran: "The young gentleman thought, I \ndare swear, there was no one could break him of those crimes, but I\'ll \nwhip this bold backside of his till I strip every bit of skin off it, or I\'ll work \nan amendment in him." The youth pleaded, "Try me this once, my \ndearest mistress! Oh gracious! Try me! Oh, I\'m killed! let me down! let \nme down! nurse! nurse! nurse!" She answered, "You may roar, and \ncry, and kick, and plunge, and implore, my pretty gentleman, but all will \nnot do; I\'ll whip you till the blood runs to your heels! You shall feel \nthe tuition of this excellent rod!" 49 \n\nWilliam Gladstone, four times prime minister of England, regular- \nly indulged in flagellation and patronized brothels for the purpose, as \nwas discovered when his diaries were published in 1975. 50 Of course, \nEnglish public-school customs of hazing and caning created many \nunfortunates whose sexual drives were warped into a confusion between \npleasure and pain; the poet Swinburne presents a well-known exam- \nple. But a tradition even older had predisposed all Christendom to this \nkind of confusion. The sense of sin and guilt attached to all forms of \nsexuality; the ubiquitous image of a tortured Christ revered for his \nsuffering (inflicted on him by Father); the generally accepted theory \nthat children must be trained to "fear God" through painful punish- \nments many such things together established a culture of cruelty, \n\n\n\n1011 \n\n\n\nTransubstantiation where men often judged their own success in life by their level of ability \n\nto make others suffer. This was the real meaning of power. \n\n_^^^^^^^^^_ Psychologically, men who obviously enjoyed torturing women anc \n\nchildren revealed their own incapacity to inspire love. Sadists find \nsadistic behavior satisfying because it can elicit strong emotional re- \nsponses from people who would otherwise pay no attention to them. \nA sadist doesn\'t know how to be lovable. This feeling of powerlessness \ncan be transformed into a feeling of power if he can torture. He can \neven achieve something like a sense of bravery or daring, despite the \nfact that the victim has no opportunity to retaliate. To subject others \nto any violent physical attack is to defy their rage. When such rage is \nmade completely helpless to express itself, as in the case of a prisoner, \nthe victim becomes an object of total control which is precisely what \nmen yearned to make of women ever since patriarchal thought \nintroduced the possibility. \n\nSadism has been called the religion of psychical cripples. 51 It was \nalso a religion of sexual cripples. Unable to reconcile their concept of \nsin with the tenderness and affection that good sexual relatedness \nrequires, Christians turned to perverted obsessions with pain and \npunishment. Western historians were fond of describing the barbarian \ncruelties of the ancient pagan world, as contrasted with a "Christian" \nmorality of kindness. However, it might appear that of the two ap- \nproaches to morality, paganism was the kinder one on the whole. At \nleast its cruelty was never so mercilessly efficient as that of western \ncivilization, extending from the Inquisition to the wars and concen- \ntration camps of the 20th century. \n\n1.

Rationalists like Cicero objected to ^^^^^^^^^^ \nthe practice: "When we call the corn Ceres and the wine Bacchus we \nuse a common figure of speech; but do you imagine that any one is so \ninsane as to believe that the thing he feeds upon is a god?" Yet the \nvulgar did indeed believe it, transforming the ancient omophagia into \ngrain-flesh and wine-blood of the god who might carry them into \nheaven when he became a part of them. Jesus repeated the same claim \nas all other savior gods: "Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my \nblood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day." 2 \n\nThe theory behind transubstantiation was the most primitive kind \nof magic, "the echo of some prehistoric cannibalistic religion. . . . \nThe flesh and blood consumed becomes an innate part of the diner. \nThus, if a man feeds on a stag, some measure of the animal\'s \nswiftness becomes a part of his own skill; if he drinks the blood of a \nwarrior, he acquires the warrior\'s power and strength." 3 If he eats a \ngod, he becomes godlike. \n\nLiteral belief in the conversion of bread and wine into Jesus\'s flesh \nand blood was essential to the idea of salvation, which Christianity \nshared with the pagan Mysteries. Doubt on this point was not tolerated. \nSt. Gregory the Great told of a woman who dared laugh at the \nEucharist, explaining to Gregory, "I laughed because you called this \nmorsel of bread, which I kneaded with my own hands, the \'Body of \nChrist.\'" Gregory then prayed, and caused the host lying on the altar to \nbe changed into "a piece of flesh in the form of a finger." This \nconvinced the woman, who then ate the bread she had just seen turned \ninto a finger, and came back to the faith. 4 \n\nEven today, those who tried to reinterpret the Eucharist as a purely \nsymbolic act have been rebuked ex cathedra by the pope. The 1965 \nencyclical Mysterium Fidei once again insisted on "the marvelous \nchange of the whole of the bread\'s substance into Christ\'s body and \nthe whole of the wine\'s substance into his blood." Having never \nwavered on this point, churchmen were curiously inconsistent, to say \nthe least, in condemning converted Mexican Indians for secretly con- \ntinuing their "great heresy and abominable sin," which consisted of \nmaking "dough images of their god which were distributed and eaten." 5 \n\nTransubstantiation was one of the primary doctrinal causes of the \nProtestant Reformation. John Huss and his colleague Jerome of \nPrague went to the stake for denying it, but their martyrdom set off the \nwar between the papacy and the Bohemian heretics, which ended \nwith the church\'s loss of all Bohemia and the foundation of the \nindependent Moravian church. 6 Protestants eventually developed \ncontempt for Catholic "God-eaters." Heath\'s 1610 Epigrammes called \nthem worse than cannibals, who committed only the lesser sin of \neating man\'s flesh. 7 Both factions, perhaps dimly recalling pagan ver- \nsions of transubstantiation, viewed witches as cannibals. "Where the \n\n\n\n1013 \n\n\n\nTransvestism basic internal social divisions are between the generations or sexes, \n\nwomen and children are often cast as witches and cannibals by the \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ dominant males." 8 \n\nThere was much satisfaction in pagan communion feasts where \nthe god was incarnate in an edible animal and distributed even to the \npoor, who seldom enjoyed any meat of their own. But the church came \nto regard this kind of feast as too expensive. "The point that really \nmerits attention is that the nutritive value of the communion feast is \nvirtually zero, whether there is transubstantiation or not. . . . What \nthe end of animal sacrifice really signified was the end of ecclesiastical \nredistributive feasting." 9 \n\n1. Robertson, 27. 2. H. Smith, 168, 200. 3. Jobes, 219. 4. de Voragine, 185. \n5.

A common method was to put on women\'s clothes. \n\nTransvestism is found in a majority of ancient priesthoods. Tacitus \nsaid the priests of Germanic tribes were muliebri ornatu, men dressed \nup as women. 1 Norse priests of sunrise and sunset rituals in honor of the \nHaddingjar (Heavenly Twins) were men whose office demanded that \nthey wear the dress and hair styles of women. 2 Even Thor, the thunder \ngod, received his magic hammer and was filled with power only after \nhe put on the garments of the Goddess Freya and pretended to be a \nbride. 5 \n\nAt the ancient Argive "Feast of Wantonness" (Hubristika) men \nbecame women by wearing women\'s dresses and veils, temporarily \nassuming feminine powers in violation of a specific taboo. 4 Cretan \npriests of Leukippe, the White-Mare-Mother, always wore female \ndress. So did priests of Heracles, ostensibly in memory of their god\'s \nservice (in female dress) to the Lydian Goddess Omphale, personifi- \ncation of the omphalos} The Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides \nsaid men in his day put on women\'s clothing to invoke the aid of the \nGoddess Venus. 6 \n\nRoman priests of the Magna Mater dressed as women, and \ntransvestism figured prominently in Roman rites of the Lupercalia \nand the Ides of January. The custom was still prevalent in the time of St. \nAugustine, who inveighed against men who clothed themselves in \nwomen\'s garments at the feast of Janus. He said such men could not \nattain salvation, even if they were otherwise good Christians. Before \nhis conversion to Christianity, St. Jerome even participated in ritual \ntransvestism, though his biographers tried to pretend that he had \nworn women\'s clothes by mistake. 7 \n\n\n\n1014 \n\n\n\nDespite Augustine and other church fathers, ritual transvestism Transvestism \n\ncontinued. Men dressed in women\'s clothes at religious festivals at \n\nAmasea in the 5 th century, and again or still at the Kalends of ^^^^^^^^i \n\nJanuary in the 10th century. Balsamon said in the 12th century even \nthe clergy participated in pagan rites in the nave of the church, wearing \nmasks and female dress. 8 Gregory of Tours, bishop of Auvergne in \nMerovingian times, was forced to give up his church to a crowd of \n"demons," their leader dressed as a woman and seated on the \nepiscopal throne. 9 The inquisitor Jean Bodin asserted that male and \nfemale witches actually changed their sex by changing clothes with \none another. 10 \n\nMen\'s transvestism was rooted in the ancient desire to imitate \nfemale magic. In the Celebes, religious rituals remained in the hands \nof women, assisted by an order of priests who wore female dress and \nwere called tjalabai, "imitation women." The same word was applied \nin Arabia to the robe that men copied from women, djallaba. n Among \nthe northern Batak the shaman is always a woman, and the office is \nhereditary in the female line, because there was no transvestism. 12 In \nBorneo, magicians are required to wear female clothing. Siberian \nshamans often wore women\'s clothes. Considered greatest were those \nshamans who could "change their sex" and become female, taking \nhusbands and living as homosexual wives. 13 \n\nSimilarly, American Indians viewed the homosexual or berdache \nas a gifted medicine man. He claimed to receive an order from the \nMoon-goddess in a dream, to the effect that he must turn female and \nbecome one of her own. He was accepted by the tribe as the woman \nhe wanted to be, was allowed to wear women\'s clothes, joined the \nwomen\'s craft guilds and dance societies. Eliade says, "Ritual and \nsymbolic transformation into a woman is probably explained by an \nideology derived from the archaic matriarchy." H \n\nAn observer in Maiaya said it was "more than likely that manang- \nism (shamanism) was originally a profession of women, and that men \nwere gradually admitted to it, at first only by becoming as much like \nwomen as possible." 15 The manang or shaman put on female \nclothing after initiation, and remained a transvestite for life. A Dyak \nmanang still wears women\'s dress and follows women\'s occupations. \n"This transvestism, with all the changes that it involved, is accepted \nafter a supernatural command has been thrice received in dreams: to \nrefuse would be to seek death. This combination of elements shows \nclear traces of a feminine magic and a matriarchal mythology, which \nmust formerly have dominated the shamanism of the Sea Dyak; almost \nall the spirits are invoked by the manang under the name of Ini \n(\'Great Mother\')." 16 \n\nThe Krishna cult as currently practiced in India still demands ritual \ntransvestism for men who adore the feminine principle by identifying \nthemselves with Krishna\'s Gopis. They wear the clothes and ornaments \nof women and even observe a "menstrual period" of a few days\' \n\n\n\n1015 \n\n\n\nTretuilngid retirement each month. According to their theological doctrine, "all \n\nTriangle souls are feminine to God." ,7 \n\n^^___^^^_^_ 1 Tacitus, 730. 2. Turville-Petre, 219. 3. Oxenstierna, 206. 4.

The shamrock-god \nwas assimilated to St. Patrick, another bearer of the trefoil, whose name \nmeant "father" like that of any tribal begetter. Old legends said the \nIrish god\'s trefoil produced apple, nut, and oak trees, as well as the five \nmystic trees representing the five senses. 1 See Shamrock; Trident. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 518. \n\n\n\nvar.Trivia Trevia \n\n"Three Ways," a Roman title of Hecate as Goddess of three-way \ncrossroads, where her three-faced images received offerings of cake, \nfruit, or money. She also ruled springs and fountains. Money is still \noffered to the Roman fountain that bears her name, Trevi. \n\nThe modern meaning of "trivia" may be related to early attempts \nto belittle the cult of the Goddess and render unimportant the old \ncustom of offering gifts to her image for protection on journeys. \n\n\n\nTriangle \n\nTantric tradition said the triangle was the Primordial Image, or the \nfemale Triangle of Life. 1 It was known as the Kali Yantra, representing \nKali as Cunti, or else as the Yoni Yantra, or sign of the vulva. 2 In \nEgypt the triangle was a hieroglyphic sign for "woman," and it carried \nthe same meaning among the gypsies, who brought it from their \noriginal home in Hindustan. 3 In the Greek sacred alphabet, the delta or \ntriangle stood for the Holy Door, vulva of the All-Mother Demeter \n("Mother Delta"). \n\nMost ancient symbol systems recognized the triangle as a sign of \nthe Goddess\'s Virgin-Mother-Crone trinity and at the same time as \nher genital "holy place," source of all life. The triangle represented the \nVirgin Moon Goddess called Men-Nefer, archaic deity of the first \nMother-city of Memphis. 4 The triangle itself was worshipped in much \nthe same way that modern Christians worship the cross. Concerning \nthis, Oriental sages said: "The object of the worship of the Yantra is to \n\n\n\n1016 \n\n\n\nattain unity with the Mother of the Universe in Her forms as Mind, \nLife, and Matter . . . preparatory to Yoga union with Her as She is in \nherself as Pure Consciousness." 5 \n\nThe triangle was everywhere connected with the female trinity, \nand a frequent component of monograms of Goddesses. To the \nGnostics, the triangle signified "creative intellect." 6 \n\n1. Silberer, 170. 2. Muhnnirvanntuntrn, 127. 3. Lederer, 141. 4. Book of the Dead, 204. \n5. Avalon, 428. 6.

In India, the "trident-bearer" was Shiva, bridegroom of \nthreefold Kali. 1 In the west, the trident passed to such underground or \nabyssal gods as Hades, Pluto, Neptune, and Poseidon, and after them \nto the Christian devil, their composite descendant. \n\nCeltic myth retained the original phallic significance of the Triple \nKey to the Holy Door. Like Shiva, the primitive Irish shamrock-god \nTrefuilngid Tre-Eochair was a "bearer of the triple key." Symbol of \nhis Door was the trefoil that the Arabs called shamrakh and the \nHindus worshipped as an emblem of Kali thousands of years before the \nfirst Aryans came to Ireland. 2 The Irish god was quaintly assimilated \nto Christianity by a Middle Irish text claiming that he appeared to \nFintan, king of Tara, on the day of Christ\'s death, bearing a sacred \nbranch with three fruits, and stone tablets of Celtic property law. 5 \n\nBecause the trident was generally recognized as a phallus in pagan \ntradition, Renaissance "devils" were often pictured with three- \npronged or forked penises. A devil "cum membro bifurcate" was \nmentioned in 1 520, and a number of inquisitorial judges said witches \ncopulated with devils whose phalli had two or more points. 4 \n\nl.O\'Flaherty, 130. 2.

Triduana was the Three Dianas, a threefold Lady of the \nMoon. She was credited with the same legend of eye-sacrifice as St. \nLucy, the Christian transformation of Juno Lucina (see Lucy, Saint). \nTriduana\'s shrine at Restalrig was destroyed in 1 560 by a church \narder that declared it "a monument of idolatry." \' So, even as a saint, \njhe proved to be unacceptable to the church that canonized her. \nl.Gifford, 131. \n\n\n\n1017 \n\n\n\nTrinity \n\n\n\nLike three-headed \nKali in India, Egypt\'s \nprimal mother Mut \nhad three heads and \nthree names. An ar- \nchaic name for Egypt, \nKhem, with a femi- \nnine ending formed the \nword for "three" \nKhemt* \n\n\n\nTrinity \n\nFrom the earliest ages, the concept of the Great Goddess was a trinity \nand the model for all subsequent trinities, female, male, or mixed. \nAnatolian villages in the 7th millenium b.c. worshipped a Goddess in \nthree aspects as a young woman, a birth-giving matron, and an old \nwoman. 1 This typical Virgin-Mother-Crone combination was Par- \nvati-Durga-Uma (Kali) in India, Ana-Babd-Macha (the Morrigan) in \nIreland, or in Greece Hebe-Hera-Hecate, the three Moerae, the \nthree Gorgons, the three Graeae, the three Horae, etc. Among the \nVikings, the threefold Goddess appeared as the Norns; among the \nRomans, as the Fates or Fortunae; among the druids, as Diana \nTriformis. The Triple Goddess had more than three: she had \nhundreds of forms. \n\nPre-Roman Latium worshipped her as the Capitoline Triad under \nthe collective name of Uni, "The One," a cognate olyoni. Her three \npersonae were Juventas the Virgin, Juno the Mother, and Menarva or \nMinerva the wise Crone. Under the empire, Juventas was ousted to \nmake room for a masculine member of the trinity, Jupiter. 2 Some \nmodern scholars refer to the two-female, one-male Capitoline Triad \nof the later period as "three gods" as if they might describe a group of \ntwo women and one man as "three men." 3 \n\nCumont says, "Oriental theologians developed the idea that the \nworld forms a trinity; it is three in one and one in three." 5 The \nmasculine scholar substitutes the neuter "world" for "Goddess," though \nthey were in a sense synonymous. It was she who established the \ntrinitarian form of Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer. Even though \nBrahmans evolved a male trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva to \nplay these parts, Tantric scriptures insisted that the Triple Goddess had \ncreated these three gods in the first place. 6 \n\nThe three aspects of the Goddess were personified on earth by \nthree kinds of priestesses: Yogini, Matri, Dakini nubile virgins, \nmothers, and elder women. These were sometimes called "deities of \nnature." Manifestations of the Triple Goddess were known as The \nThree Most Precious Ones. 7 \n\nNegritos of the Malay Peninsula remembered the Goddess as Kari, \na virgin who conceived the first man and woman by eating her own \nlotus; yet she was also a trinity called the "three grandmothers under the \nearth." 8 \n\nEven in pre-Columbian Mexico the Virgin Goddess who gave \nbirth to the Savior Quetzalcoatl was a trinity, one of "three divine \nsisters." Like the Semitic Mary, she was a birth-giver, mother, and \ndeath-bringer all at once, for she was also known as the Precious \nStone of Sacrifice, apparently represented by the altar on which her \nsavior-son\'s blood was poured out. 9 \n\nMother of the Greek gods was a trinity composed of Virgin Hebe, \nMother Hera, and Crone Hecate; at Stymphalus she was wor- \nshipped as Child, Bride, and Widow. 10 Each of her personae could be a \n\n\n\n1018 \n\n\n\ntrinity again, so she could be the Muses or the Ninefold Goddess. Trinity \n\nHecate was called Triformis and shown with three faces, each a lunar \n\nphase. 11 Among the Irish she was the Triple Morrigan, or Morgan, ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsometimes multiplied into "nine sisters" who kept the Cauldron of \n\nRegeneration and ruled the western isle of the dead. 12 \n\nThe Goddess Triformis ruled heaven as Virgin, earth as Mother, \nand the underworld as Crone, or Hel, or Queen of the Shades. This \nwas remembered even in Chaucer\'s time, for his Palamon invoked her \n"Three Forms," Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, Proserpine in \nhell. 13 The old name of Sicily, Trinacria, invoked her as a "center of the \nearth" with three realms. \n\nBardic romances abounded in manifestations of the Triple God- \ndess. Wayland the Smith married her, after she first appeared to him \nas three magic doves. 14 King Arthur went to Avalon with her. The \ntriadic Guinevere was another version of her. Sir Marhaus (Mars) \nencountered her as the Three Damosels at their magic fountain: the \neldest "threescore winters of age, wearing a garland of gold; the \nsecond thirty winters of age, wearing a circlet of gold; the youngest \nfifteen winters of age, wearing a wreath of flowers." 15 Fifteen was the \nnumber of the pagan Virgin Kore, the pentacle in the apple. Mythic \nvirgin mothers, like that of Zoroaster, typically gave birth at the age of \n1 5. Double that was the Mother\'s age, double again the age of the \nCrone. \n\nThe Middle East had many trinities, most originally female. As \ntime went on, one or two members of the triad turned male. The \nusual pattern was Father-Mother-Son, the Son figure envisioned as a \nSavior. 16 \n\nThe notion of a trinity appeared during the 14th century B.C. \namong the Hatti and Mitanni. In the 5th century B.C., a popular \nBabylonian trinity was composed of Shamash, Sin, and Ishtar Sun, \nMoon, and Star. In Greece this was repeated as Helios the sun, \nSelene the moon, and Aphrodite the star. A Father-Mother-Son trinity \nwas worshipped at Costopitum as Jupiter Dolichenus, Celestial \nBrigantia, and Sal us. 17 \n\nGnostic versions of the trinity followed the Father-Mother-Son \npatterns of the contemporary east, with the Holy Ghost recognized as \na female Sophia, the Dove, worshipped as the Great Goddess in \nConstantinople, and viewed by most Gnostics as the Shakti of God. \nThe Christian God was originally modeled on Far-Eastern heaven- \nfathers, such as Brahma and Dyaus Pitar, all of whom needed their \nfemale sources of "Power," or else they could not act. 18 Therefore, a \nfemale member of the triad was essential even to God. Among \nArabian Christians there was apparently a holy trinity of God, Mary, \nand Jesus, worshipped as an interchangeable replacement for the \nEgyptian trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. 19 \n\nDuring the Christian era, all-male trinities became popular among \nGermanic tribes. Woden, Thor, and Saxnot were worshipped together \n\n\n\n1019 \n\n\n\nTriptotemus by Saxons of the 8th and 9th centuries. Norsemen called them Odin, \n\nTristan Tyr, and Frey. According to a certain fragmentary myth, the Triple \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ Goddess seems to have been burned as a witch. She had to be burned \n\nto ashes three times. Afterward, youth, beauty, and love in the person of \nFreya departed from Asgard; and there was war in heaven. 20 \n\nLike many other remnants of paganism, the female trinity is still \nassociated with marriage. Breton wedding ceremonies celebrated the \nthree phases of the bride\'s life, impersonating her first by a little girl, \nthen by the mistress of a house, then by an old grandmother. 21 \nModern weddings still retain the flower girl and the matron of honor, \nbut significantly the Crone figure has vanished. \n\nAugust Comte nearly revived the female trinity in his vision of \nwoman as mediator between man and the guiding moral spirit. \nMother, wife, and daughter were to represent man\'s unity with past, \npresent, and future; also with what Comte called the three altruistic \ninstincts: veneration, attachment, benevolence. 22 In plainer words, these \nwere what women want from men: respect, love, kindness. \n\n1.

When he met his Shakti \nin the form of Iseult, he reversed the syllables of his name and \nintroduced himself as Tantris, which may have been a secret bardic pun \nor "recognition sign." \' Though Iseult was the wife of King Mark of \nCornwall, the poets called King Mark a "felon" for trying to prevent her \nfrom choosing her own lover.

Association with bridges suggests the Valkyries who guarded \nBifrdst, the Bridge of Heaven; they too were "trulls" or "trolls."

Brides \ndeflowered themselves on the erect penis of the god\'s statue, in order \nthat the god, not a man, should "open the matrix" as the biblical \nphrase goes, and the firstborn child could be considered God-begotten. 1 \nAny woman thus deflowered was described as a Virgin Bride of God. \nThe god himself was a Christos, "anointed," because his phallus was \nanointed with chrism or holy oil. The custom was still common in the \n4th century a.d. See Firstborn. \n\n1.

The \nevent is shown on a famous silver plaque from Luristan, dated in the \n8th century b.c. 4 \n\nAmerican Indians said the White Manitu or Lord of Life and the \nBlack Manitu or Lord of Death were twins, born simultaneously from \nthe womb of the Moon-goddess, called The Old Woman Who Never \nDies, the real ruler of all gods and men. 5 \n\nGnostics said the sun god Sol, Helios, or Apollo had a dark twin, \nknown as Sol Niger (Black Sun), king of the nether world. The \nChaldeans called him Aciel. 6 The light god was transformed into the \ndark god when he entered into conjunction with their common mother, \nthe Moon. \n\nThroughout all mythologies the same pair can be found: twins of \n\n\n\n1022 \n\n\n\nlight and darkness, born from the Great Mother. Every dualistic Tyche \n\nreligion-such as Zoroastrianism-opposing a principle of evil to a princi- Typhon \n\npie of good had to begin with the two principles personified as offspring ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nof the primordial womb.

In the Skanda \nPurana, Uma appeared as a demoness with a vagina dentata: "hard \nteeth like thunderbolts with sharp tips inside the vagina." l Sometimes \nUma was called Daughter of the Mountains, or Daughter of Heav- \nen that is, of Himalaya, which meant both mountain and heaven.

To be admitted to the Holy of Holies, a woman had to \nhave borne children to prove she had the spirit of fertility and the \n"wisdom of motherhood." \n\n\n\nUncle \n\nBefore recognition of physical fatherhood, and even for a long time \nafter it, most people viewed a mother\'s brother as a child\'s nearest male \nrelative, because he was united with the mother and the mother\'s \nmother by the all-important matrilineal blood bond. Hawaiians still use \n\n\n\n1026 \n\n\n\nthe same word for "father" and "uncle" because formerly they made Uni \n\nno distinction between them. 1 Unicorn \n\nTacitus said Germanic barbarians regarded the relationship be- ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ntween sister\'s sons and maternal uncles as "more sacred and binding" \nthan the relationship between sons and fathers. 2 The same was true of \nthe Celts. Early Christian missionaries in Ireland had to call Christ \n"our sister\'s son," because that was the only masculine relationship held \nsacred by the people. J \n\nMalory said the whole purpose of introducing Christianity into \nBritain was to establish laws of patrilineal succession and the authority \nof father. Among the pagans, fathers and sons cared nothing for one \nanother. 4 Only nephews and maternal uncles had a true blood bond. \nMore recently among the Semang, enlightened sages and prophets \nwere known as nephews of God, not sons of God. 5 \n\nFathers were of no significance in family relationships among the \nmatrilineal clans of early Latium. Inheriting this tradition, even \npatriarchal Romans distinguished between a father\'s brother, patruus, \nand a mother\'s brother, avunculus derived from avus, "ancestor." \nThe patruus was unimportant and usually ignored. 6 The avunculus was \nthe true uncle, as shown by the very word "uncle" which descended \nfrom his title, and "avuncular" which implies a benevolent interest. \nEurope still retains a linguistic memory of the dual-uncle system. A \nfather\'s brother is just an uncle; but a mother\'s brother is called "own \nuncle." \n\nSystems of uncle relationships were always older than those of \npaternity, having descended from the matriarchal period when father- \nhood was not understood.

Unial \n\nEtruscan name for the Great Mother\'s holy trinity, a "three-in-one" \nGoddess who gave birth to the uni-verse. She was represented by the \nsign of female genitals; Uni was a cognate of "yoni." In Rome, the \nthree were worshipped as the early Capitoline Triad of Virgin-Mother- \nCrone (Juventas, Juno, Minerva); but in Imperial times the virgin \nGoddess was removed to make room for Jupiter. 1 The name of Uni \nevolved into Iune, or Juno. \n\n1.

According to medieval legend, the unicorn could be \ncaptured only by a virgin girl, because his irresistible desire was to lay \n\n\n\n1027 \n\n\n\nUrania \nUraceus \n\n\n\nhis "horn" in a maiden\'s lap. While thus engaged, he was incapable of \nresisting capture. (However, no unicorns were ever captured.) \n\nThe unicorn was a secret phallic consort of the virgin Mary, shown \ninside her "enclosed garden" of virginity, in many examples of \nChristian mystical art. At times he was identified with the Savior. A \nmedieval hymn called Christ "the wild wild unicorn whom the \nVirgin caught and tamed." \' \n\nA source of the unicorn myth may have been the Babylonian \ndragon-beast made up of a horselike body with lion\'s forelegs, scales, \na snakelike neck and a flat horned head with a single spike growing from \nthe center of the nose. 2 One theory proposes that the unicorn was \noriginally the bull of spring, rearing up and struggling with the lion of \nsummer. Babylonian art showed both animals in profile, so the bull \nappeared to have only one horn. The British coat of arms still has "the \nlion and the unicorn" contending in just such a manner. 3 \n\nExplorers thought they found the legendary unicorn in the African \nrhinoceros. Because of the unicorn\'s phallic significance, powdered \nrhinoceros horn became a highly popular "remedy" for impotence, and \nis so used even today. 4 \n\n1. Harding, 51. 2. Hooke, S.P., 135. 3.

The serpent-mother was one of Egypt\'s oldest divinities, \nand her uraeus-snake idol signified healing. Moses copied this Egyptian \nmagic with his "brazen serpent" (Numbers 21:9). Egyptian rulers \nwore the uraeus-snake in the form of a rearing cobra on the forehead, \nrepresenting the "third eye" of mystical insight. Despite patriarchal \nopposition to the symbol of the she-serpent Uraeus, among later \nGnostic Christians her name became one of the "secret names of \nGod." See Serpent. \n\n\n\nUrania \n\n"Celestial One," title of Aphrodite as Queen of Heaven. Her former \nconsort Uranus was transformed into her castrated "father" in classical \nmyth; Uranus\'s patricidal son threw his severed genitals into the sea, \nand the sea-womb brought forth Aphrodite. Actually, Celestial Aphrodi- \nte and the sea-womb were one and the same: manifestations of the \nTriple Goddess. The castrated dying god was her ubiquitous son-lover \nwho died, fertilized her by his death, and begot himself again. \n\nUranus was a western form of Varuna, a deity of indeterminate \nsex, sometimes a male-turned-female like Hermes or Teiresias. To \n\n\n\n1028 \n\n\n\nthe Persians he was varan, a spirit of sexual intercourse like the Hindu Urd \n\nKama. His name came from vr, to envelop a female function and Urine \n\nhe performed female-imitative miracles, such as turning water into ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nblood, giving birth to the sun, and measuring the earth. 1 From the \nAsian precedents it may be assumed that Urania and Uranus were the \nsame primal androgyne as Jana-Janus, Diana-Dianus, etc. \n\n1.

Urth \n\nOne of the Norse names of Mother Earth, in addition to Urtha, \nErda, Eartha, Wyrd, Wurd, Word, Weird, etc. Urd was usually called \nthe divine fount of wisdom tended by the three Norns (Fates) under \nthe root of the World Tree; it was also the name of the oldest Norn, an \nEarth Goddess who knew everything, past, present, and future. The \ngods couldn\'t render judgment unless they gathered at the fount of Urd, \nbecause they were helpless without the wisdom imparted by the \nUrdarbrunnr, "Stream of Urd," which gave life and mind. Old mythol- \nogies held that the fount of wisdom was female, and without it \nneither men nor gods could know anything. 1 Another name for the \nfountain was Mimir, which means "Mother," although the same \nname was given later to Odin\'s maternal uncle, who brought him back \nto life with fluid from the Mother-spring and taught him the wisdom \nof the runes. \n\n1 . Branston, 76. \n\n\n\nUrim and Thummim \n\nDivinatory knucklebones or "dice" used by Jewish priests, probably \ncopied from the oracular knucklebones said to have been invented by \nHermes. Kings of Israel governed their acts by the prophecies of the \nUrim and Thummim (1 Samuel 28:6). Levitical law directed that these \narticles be carried in the high priest\'s "breastplate of judgment" \nwhenever he entered the tabernacle, so the mana of the holy place \nwould enter into them and yield correct prophecies (Exodus 28:30). \n\n\n\nline \n\nrom Uranus, "Father Heaven," whose magical urine, semen, or \nilood came down as rain to fertilize Mother Earth. Primitive myths \nresent all three fluids as the fertilizing principle. Zeus came down as \n\'golden rain" of urine to fertilize Danae, the Earth, whose priestesses \n\nle Danaids performed rain charms by carrying water in a sieve. \n\nccording to Aristophanes, rain was caused by Zeus urinating through a \n\n\n\n1029 \n\n\n\nUrsu| ^ Sjint s i eve . Aristotle mentioned the general belief that "Zeus does not rain \n\nin order to make the crops grow, but from necessity," suggesting that \n\n^^ Zeus rained for the same reason men urinated because he had to. 1 \n\n^" The Danaids founded the Eleusinian rite of Thesmophoria, when \n\nthe severed genitals of the sacred king were offered to the Goddess, \njust as the severed genitals of Uranus were given to the sea-womb. The \nreal genitals of a real victim were eventually replaced by symbolic \nsubstitutes: serpents and phallus-shaped loaves of bread. But the mean- \ning was the same a summoning of the god\'s urine, semen, or \nblood. 2 \n\nAeschylus said of the Danaids\' performance: "Rain falling from \nthe bridegroom sky makes pregnant the Earth. Then brings she forth \nfor mortals pasture of flocks and corn, Demeter\'s gift, and the fruitful- \nness of trees is brought to completion by the dew of their marriage." \nAs the Goddess was both Earth and Sea, the rain-urine-seed-blood, etc., \nfell on both. The priestesses looked up to the sky and cried, "Rain! " \nThen they looked down to the earth and cried, "Conceive! " ? \n\nRain-making was a chief function of Heavenly Fathers every- \nwhere. Rome\'s begetting god was Jupiter Pluvius, \nJupiter-Who-Makes-Rain, another version of Zeus, who was in turn a \nreplacement for Uranus. Even after the essential fluid was definitely \nidentified as semen, the other fluids were not forgotten. Urine remained \na popular rain charm. Shamans in Siberia used to bring rain by \n"making water" on the naked body of a woman who represented the \nearth. 4 In Iraq, when rain was wanted, a female dummy called the \nBride of God was placed in a field, in the hope that God would "make \nwater" on her. 5 \n\n1.

Ursel means "She-Bear," the title of Artemis \nCalliste, the same as the Helvetian Goddess Artio, in the guise of Ursa \nMajor, the Great Bear (Big Dipper), whose constellation circles the \npole star without disappearing into the sea. The ancients said Artemis \nthe She-Bear ruled all the stars until Zeus usurped her place. 1 \n\nThe mythical St. Ursula was accompanied by eleven thousand \nvirgins, a common pagan image of the Moon-goddess accompanied \nby her children, the stars. One of the Goddess\'s foremost shrines was \nCologne, where "Ursel" was converted into a Christian heroine to \naccount for the reverence paid to her by the local people. \n\nThe tale on which Ursula\'s canonization was based was first \ninvented about the 9th century a.d.; then, "During the 12th century \n\n\n\n1030 \n\n\n\nthis pious romance was preposterously elaborated through the mistakes Ursula, Saint \n\nof imaginative visionaries; a public burial-ground uncovered at Co- \nlogne was taken to be the grave of the martyrs, false relics came into ^^^^^^^^^ mK ^ \ncirculation and forged epitaphs of non-existent persons were \nproduced." 2 \n\nThe churchmen claimed that St. Ursula was a Breton princess \nbetrothed to Conon, prince of England, in the 5th century a.d. Prior \nto her marriage, she took her eleven thousand virgins on a pilgrimage. \nWhile passing through Cologne, they were attacked and slaughtered \nby the Huns, at the instigation of two Roman generals who feared the \nChristian ladies\' exemplary piety would convert all the northern \nbarbarians to Christ. 3 \n\nThis fable was intended to Christianize the lunar bear-goddess \nworshipped at Cologne, the same who was Artio, the Helvetian \n"Mother of Animals," with another cult center at Berne ("She-Bear"), \nwhere her portrait still appears on the Bernese coat of arms. 4 Ursel \nand Artio were alternate names of the triple Artemis who took the \n"bear-king" Arthur to paradise. The Greeks said Artemis Calliste, \n"Fairest One," was associated with both the moon and the constellation \nof the Great Bear. In Britain, Ursa Major was often called "Mistress \nUrsula," at first a title ofthe Goddess, later transferred to the saint. 5 \n\nArtemis the She-Bear was so widely recognized as the Mother \nof Animals that the island once sacred to her, Callista, is still called \nThera, "She-Beast." 6 Arcadians traced their descent from her son \nAreas, the Little Bear (Ursa Minor), a bear-god like the Celtic Arthur. \nHellenic mythographers pretended that Arcas\'s mother was a mere \nnymph, Calliste, who was punished for losing her virginity by receiving \nthe form of a bear, along with her child; but Artemis took pity on \nthem and placed them in the stars as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. This \nversion ofthe myth was invented "to account for the traditional \nconnection between Artemis and the Great Bear." 7 The Christian \nversion was invented for different reasons, but with the same ultimate \naim: to mortalize the Goddess. \n\nSome memory of Ursula the Moon-goddess seems to haunt the \nfoundation ofthe Ursuline order of nuns, by St. Angela Merici in \n1506. Catholic authorities now claim the Ursulines were the oldest \norder of teaching nuns. But most convents were centers of learning \nfor women until the church forbade women\'s education in the 1 3th \ncentury. 8 The Ursulines were perhaps the only order of teaching \nnuns who remained obedient to the papacy, and so were permitted to \ncontinue. \n\nYet the Ursulines began under a cloud of suspicion. Angela Merici \nwas a native of Brescia, which Pope Calixtus III described as a hotbed \nof witches. 9 Angela\'s first group of sisters numbered exactly 28, the \nlunar number. They made their first devotion in a church dedicated \nto another mythical saint who was only another transformation ofthe \nGoddess, St. Afra or Aphra (Aphrodite). 10 Angela was not allowed to \n\n\n\n1031 \n\n\n\nU^jert establish her holy society of teachers until forty years had passed since \n\nher original vision, which she received not in a church but in an open \n\n^^ field under the moon. She and her women had no religious habit, no \n\nvows, no communal life. They went to their pupils\' homes to teach, \nlike itinerant governesses. \n\nThe church was not interested in Angela until she underwent \n"popular" canonization in her home territory. Two centuries later, \nthe church decided to take advantage of the popularity of her cult by \ndeclaring her Blessed. Finally in 1807 she was canonized by Pope \nPius VII. 11 But she is still almost as vague and dim as the Ursuline lunar \nShe-Bear that the people of Brescia once worshipped. A 20th- \ncentury Catholic scholar mentioned her with one of those curious slips \nof the pen so common among patriarchal writers; he said the \nUrsuline order was founded by "Bishop Angela of Brescia." n \n\n1.

Brewster, 459. \n\n\n\nUr-Text \n\nGreatest legendary treasure of medieval Hermetic magic, after the \nElixir of Life and the Philosopher\'s Stone. The Ur-text was supposed to \nbe a magical grammar of the primordial tongue, whose words God \npronounced at creation in order to bring forth the things themselves; \nthat is, the words could create, just by being spoken. The idea was \nbased on eastern notions of the creative power of Sanskrit, the Mother- \nlanguage. 1 Another development of the idea was the Neoplatonic \nLogos or "Seminal Word," which was adopted as a Christian dogma. \n(See Logos.) \n\nPresumably the Ur-text emanated from Abraham\'s "Ur of the \nChaldees," famous as the home of magic and astrology. The medi- \neval theory was that all words and names exerted some influence over \ntheir objects, hence the efficacy of both magic spells and liturgies. But \nin all known languages, the power of the word was slightly displaced \nfrom the true essence of the thing, as the calendar was slightly \ndisplaced from the sidereal year. In the Ur-text, words were precisely \naligned with essences or "souls," so the words could control things \nand events absolutely. \n\nThe implications were the same as in the Hindu idea of the "holy \nlanguage" of Sanskrit. Knowledge of the Ur-text would give a man \nabsolute power over the universe; whatever he said would come true at \nonce. \n\nMany magicians identified the Ur-text with the equally wonderful \nBook ofThoth, named after the Egyptian god of magic and men- \ntioned in very old Egyptian folk tales as a written version of Thoth\'s \ntechnique for creating by the power of the Word. One story claimed \n\n\n\n1032 \n\n\n\nthe book was found by a sage named Satni-Khamois in a Memphite Ur-Text \n\ntomb. It contained only two formulae but they were great hekau \n\n(words of power) : ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe two formulae that are written there, if thou recitest the first of them, \nthou shalt charm the heaven, the earth, the world of the night, the \nmountains, the waters; thou shalt understand what all the birds of heaven \nand the reptiles say, as many as there are. Thou shalt behold the fish, \nfor a divine power will bring them to the surface of the water. If thou \nreadest the second formula, even when thou art in the tomb, thou shalt \nresume the form thou hadst on earth; thou shalt also behold the sun rising \nin the heavens, and his cycle of gods, also the moon in the form that \nshe has when she appears. 2 \n\nThe first beneficiaries of this wondrous magic became immortal, \nnot by reading the book but by eating the papyrus it was written on al- \nthough the book continued to exist, hidden in underwater vessels \nguarded by the Great Serpent. 5 Eating instead of reading a piece of \nmagical literature was a common Oriental method of absorbing the \nvirtue of magic words even when one is unable to read. In Tibet, \nMadagascar, China, and Japan it was customary to cure diseases by \nwriting the curative charm on paper and eating the paper, or its ashes. 4 \nTartar lamas wrote the names of medicines on paper and made the \npatient swallow the prescription; for they believed "To swallow the \nname of a remedy, or the remedy itself . . . comes to precisely the \nsame thing." 5 \n\nThe same notion was often found in the west. The modern \npharmacist\'s Rx began as a curative symbol of Saturn, written on \npaper and eaten by the patient. 6 A common medieval prescription for \ntoothache was a paper bearing the magic words by which Jesus \nremoved a worm from St. Peter\'s tooth. 7 The Venerable Bede declared \nthat scrapings from the pages of "books that were brought out of \nIreland," when drunk in water, instantly cured snakebite. 8 \n\nWith so many different kinds of credulity in regard to the written \nwords especially among the majority to whom all writing was a \nmysterious, unknown magic it is hardly surprising that belief in the \nBook of Books, the Ur-text, survived. Some of the beliefs concerning \nthe Ur-text became attached to the Latin Bible, which the medieval \nchurch would not allow to be translated into any other language, \neven though the readings from the pulpit were quite incomprehensible \nto most congregations. The theory was that Latin was the language of \nSt. Peter\'s Roman see, and God intended the Bible to be written in that \nlanguage and no other; for the magic efficacy of the words lay in their \nsound, which would be lost if they were rendered in another tongue. \nThus, out of superstitious belief in the power of the Word, the \nchurch kept the "dead" language of Latin alive within its own in-group \nfor over 1 500 years. \n\n1.

Freud said, "Probably no male human being is \nspared the terrifying shock of threatened castration at the sight of the \nfemale genitals." l But he had the reason wrong. The real reason for \nthis "terrifying shock" is mouth-symbolism, now recognized universally \nin myth and fantasy: "It is well known in psychiatry that both males \nand females fantasize as a mouth the female\'s entranceway to the \nvagina." 2 \n\nThe more patriarchal the society, the more fear seems to be \naroused by the fantasy. Men of Malekula, having overthrown their \nmatriarchate, were haunted by a yonic spirit called "that which draws us \nto It so that It may devour us." 3 The Yanomamo said one of the first \nbeings on earth was a woman whose vagina became a toothed mouth \nand bit off her consort\'s penis. Chinese patriarchs said women\'s \ngenitals were not only gateways to immortality but also "executioners of \nmen." 4 Moslem aphorisms said: "Three things are insatiable: the \n\n\n\n1034 \n\n\n\ndesert, the grave, and a woman\'s vulva." 5 Polynesians said the savior- Vagina Dentata \n\ngod Maui tried to find eternal life by crawling into the mouth (or \n\nvagina) of his mother Hina, in effect trying to return to the womb of the ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nCreatress; but she bit him in two and killed him. 6 \n\nStories of the devouring Mother are ubiquitous in myths, repre- \nsenting the death-fear which the male psyche often transformed into \na sex-fear. Ancient writings describe the male sexuarfunction not as \n"taking" or "possessing" the female, but rather "being taken," or \n"putting forth." 7 Ejaculation was viewed as a loss of a man\'s vital force, \nwhich was "eaten" by a woman. The Greek sema or "semen" meant \nboth "seed" and "food." Sexual "consummation" was the same as \n"consuming" (the male). Many savages still have the same imagery. \nThe Yanomamo word for pregnant also means satiated or full-fed; and \n"to eat" is the same as "to copulate." 8 \n\nDistinction between mouths and female genitals was blurred by \nthe Greek idea of the lamiae lustful she-demons, born of the \nLibyan snake-goddess Lamia. Their name meant either "lecherous \nvaginas" or "gluttonous gullets." 9 Lamia was a Greek name for the \ndivine female serpent called Kundalini in India, Uraeus or Per-Uatchet \nin Egypt, and Lamashtu in Babylon. Her Babylonian consort was \nPazuzu, he of the serpent penis. Lamia\'s legend, with its notion that \nmales are born to be eaten, led to Pliny\'s report on the sexual life of \nsnakes that was widely believed throughout Europe even up to the 20th \ncentury: a male snake fertilizes the female snake by putting his head \ninto her mouth and allowing himself to be eaten. 10 \n\nSioux Indians told a tale similar to that of the Lamia. A beautiful \nseductive woman accepted the love of a young warrior and united \nwith him inside a cloud. When the cloud lifted, the woman stood alone. \nThe man was a heap of bones being gnawed by snakes at her feet. 11 \n\nMouth and vulva were equated in many Egyptian myths. Ma-Nu, \nthe western gate whereby the sun god daily re-entered his Mother, \nwas sometimes a "cleft" (yoni), and sometimes a "mouth." 12 Priestesses \nof Bast, representing the Goddess, drew up their skirts to display their \ngenitals during religious processions. 13 To the Greeks, such a display \nwas frightening. Bellerophon fled in terror from Lycian women \nadvancing on him with genitals exposed, and even the sea god Poseidon \nretreated, for fear they might swallow him. 14 \n\nAccording to Philostratus, magical women "by arousing sexual \nlesire seek to devour whom they wish." 15 To the patriarchal Persians \nind Moslems this seemed a distinct possibility. Viewing women\'s \nnouths as either obscene, dangerous, or overly seductive, they \nnsisted on veiling them. Yet men\'s mouths, which look no different, \nvere not viewed as threatening. \n\n"Mouth" comes from the same root as "mother" Anglo-Saxon \nnuth, also related to the Egyptian Goddess Mut. Vulvas have labiae, \nlips," and many men have believed that behind the lips lie teeth. \nChristian authorities of the Middle Ages taught that certain witches, \n\n\n\n1035 \n\n\n\nVagina Dentata with the help of the moon and magic spells, could grow fangs in their \n\nvaginas. They likened women\'s genitals to the "yawning" mouth of \n__ hell, though this was hardly original; the underworld gate had always \nbeen the yoni of Mother Hel. It had always "yawned" from Middle \nEnglish yonen, another derivative of "yoni." A German vulgarity \nmeaning "cunt," Fotze, in parts of Bavaria meant simply "mouth." 16 \n\nTo Christian ascetics, Hell-mouth and the vagina drew upon the \nsame ancient symbolism. Both were equated with the womb-symbol \nof the whale that swallowed Jonah; according to this "prophecy" the \nHell-mouth swallowed Christ (as Hina swallowed her son Maui) and \nkept him for three days. Visionary trips to hell often read like "a \ndescription of the experience of being born, but in reverse, as if the \nchild was being drawn into the womb and destroyed there, instead of \nbeing formed and given life." St. Teresa of Avila said her vision of a \nvisit to hell was "an oppression, a suffocation, and an affliction so \nagonizing, and accompanied by such a hopeless and distressing \nmisery that no words I could find would adequately describe it. To say \nthat it was as if my soul were being continuously torn from my body \nis as nothing." 17 \n\nThe archetypal image of "devouring" female genitals seems unde- \nniably alive even in the modern world. "Males in our culture are so \nafraid of direct contact with female genitalia, and are even afraid of \nreferring to these genitalia themselves; they largely displace their \nfeelings to the accessory sex organs the hips, legs, breasts, buttocks, et \ncetera and they give these accessory organs an exaggerated interest \nand desirability." 18 Even here, the male scholar inexplicably "displaces\' \nthe words sex organ onto structures that have nothing to do with \nsexual functioning. \n\nLooking into, touching, entering the female orifice seems fraught \nwith hidden fears, signified by the confusion of sex with death in \noverwhelming numbers of male minds and myths. Psychiatrists say sex \nis perceived by the male unconscious as dying: "Every orgasm is a \nlittle death: the death of \'the little man,\' the penis." 19 Here indeed is the \nroot of ascetic religions that equated the denial of death with denial of \nsex. \n\nMoslems attributed all kinds of dread powers to a vulva. It could \n"bite off" a man\'s eye-beam, resulting in blindness for any man who \nlooked into its cavity. A sultan of Damascus was said to have lost his \nsight in his manner. Christian legend claimed he went to Sardinia to \nbe cured of his blindness by a miraculous idol of the virgin Mary who, \nbeing eternally virgin, had her door-mouth permanently closed by a \nveil-hymen. 20 \n\nApparently Freud was wrong in assuming that men\'s fear of \nfemale genitals was based on the idea that the female had been \ncastrated. The fear was much less empathetic, and more personal: a fear \nof being devoured, of experiencing the birth trauma in reverse. A \nCatholic scholar\'s curious description of the Hell-mouth as a womb \n\n\n\n1036 \n\n\n\ninadvertently reveals this idea: "When we think of man entering hell Vajra \n\nwe think of him as establishing contact with the most intrinsic, unified, Valentine, Saint \n\nultimate and deepest level of the reality of the world." 21 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n1.

Young men chose partners for \nerotic games by drawing "billets" small papers with women\'s \nnames on them. Christians denounced these prototypical valentines as \n"heathens\' lewd customs." l Churchmen tried to substitute saints\' \nnames and short sermons on the billets, but people soon reverted to the \nold love-notes. 2 February was sacred to Juno Februata, Goddess of \nthe "fever" (febris) of love. The church replaced her with a mythical \nmartyr, St. Valentine, who was endowed with several contradictory \nbiographies. One of them made him a handsome Roman youth, \nexecuted at the very moment when his sweetheart received his billet \nof love. 3 \n\nSt. Valentine became a patron of lovers perforce, because the \nfestival remained dedicated to lovers despite all official efforts to \nchange it. Even in its Christianized form, the Valentinian festival \ninvolved secret sex worship, called "a rite of spiritual marriage with \n\n\n\n1037 \n\n\n\nVaMtyries \n\n\n\nangels in a nuptial chamber." 4 Ordinary human beings engaged before \nwitnesses in an act of sexual intercourse described as the marriage of \nSophia and the Redeemer. A spoken formula said, in part, "Let the see< \nof light descend into thy bridal chamber, receive the bridegroom . . . \nopen thine arms to embrace him. Behold, grace has descended upon \nthee." 5 \n\nDuring the Middle Ages, St. Valentine was much invoked in love \ncharms and potions, since he was a sketchily Christianized version of \nsuch love-gods as Eros, Cupid, Kama, Priapus, or Pan. \n\n1.

Previously, the Valkyries seem to have been Amazonian \npriestesses who ruled the gates of death, and in the most primitive times \neven cannibalized the dead to give them rebirth. \n\nValkyries were northern counterparts of the funerary vulture- \npriestesses of Egypt, often decking themselves in feathers. Like \nangelic Hindu apsaras, they wore swan feathers; or, in funerary aspect, \nthey appeared as carrion crows (ravens). Dead warriors were known \nin skaldic verse as hrafengrennir, "raven-feeders," and the blood of slain \nmen was called "the raven\'s drink." l In Old Saxon the Valkyries \nwere walcyries or waelceasig, "corpse-eaters," defined as "man-eating \nwomen" during the 1 1th century a.d. 2 \n\nValkyries in their black raven-feathers were called Kraken, or \n"crows." In the Middle East also, ravens were spirits of the lunar \nsphere of death and rebirth, symbolically preserved in Mithraic religion \nas the Raven who led the initiate into the first stage of mystical \nhierarchy, the sphere of the Moon. 3 Similar connotations were still \nattached to ravens in 1613 a.d., when Perkins\'s Witchcraft said if a \nraven stands on a high place (lunar sphere), "and looks a particular way \nand cries," death can be expected to come from that direction. 4 \n\nSwans, ravens, crows, or hawks represented Valkyries in old \nballads, such as "The Maiden Transformed into a Bird," who was \nfond of eating her true-love\'s flesh. This was beneficial to him, for after \nsacrificing his flesh to her, he attained a state of paradise in her arms. 5 \nEliade says, "The Valkyries are psychopomps and sometimes play the \nrole of the \'celestial wives\' or \'spirit wives\' of the Siberian shamans. . \n. . [T]his later complex extends beyond the sphere of shamanism and \nhas elements both of the mythology of Woman and the mythology of \nDeath." 6 \n\nThe Valkyries were also totemized as mare-women, like the \nancient horse-masked priestesses of Demeter. In Sweden, a mare- \nwoman was a volva, meaning Goddess, priestess, or a witch who could \n\n\n\n1038 \n\n\n\nturn into a mare and carry a man away to death. A cognate was vala, Vampire \n\na holy woman, with Slavic and central Asian counterparts in the Vilas, \n\nWilas, or Wilis, possibly derived from vilasa, the heavenly bliss ^ m \n\ndispensed by Hindu nymphs of paradise in the service of the Goddess. 7 \nSuch spirits were sometimes called Samovila or Samodiva: "death- \ngoddess." 8 Some claimed that death in the arms of a Vila was a blissful \npassage into a fairy paradise. Others said it was cruel torment. 9 \nNaturally, this was a mythic expression of various ways of dying. See \nVila. \n\nThe Grimnismal lists 13 Valkyries, the number of a witches\' \ncoven; other sources said there were only nine, the number of the \nMuses. From the 10th to the 14th centuries, Valkyries and witches \nwere considered identical; both were also mystic swan-maidens and \nfairies. 10 Earthly priestesses who played the Valkyrie role in pagan \nfunerals were described by churchmen as either Vilas or witches. 11 \n\nValhalla or Valholl was the death-realm of Hel, the Great Vala. \nThough it was taken over by new gods led by Father Odin, its archaic \nfeminine name remained. Later myths made it a paradise reserved \nsolely for warriors and war-kings, members of the military caste who \nshared the opinions of Japanese samurai and Moslem "soldiers of \nAllah," that heavenly bliss belonged only to those who died fighting \nbravely. \n\nRadbod, king of the Frisians, refused to abandon this faith when a \nChristian missionary informed him that Valhalla was the same as the \nChristians\' hell. Where were his own ancestors, Radbod wanted to \nknow, if there was no Valhalla? He was told they were burning in hell \nbecause they were heathens. "Dastardly priest!" Radbod cried. "How \ndare you say my ancestors have gone to hell? I would rather yes, by \ntheir god, the great Woden, I swear I would ten thousand times rather \njoin those heroes in their hell, than be with you in your heaven of \npriests!" 12 \n\n1.

Homer\'s Odysseus consulted the dead with a necromantic \nceremony: "I took the sheep and cut their throats over the trench, and \nthe dark blood flowed forth, and lo, the spirits of the dead that be \ndeparted gathered them from out of Erebus." 2 \n\n\n\n1039 \n\n\n\nVampire \n\n\n\nThe Greek word for \na vampire was sarco- \nmenos, "flesh made \nby the moon."\' The \nword "vampire" was \nSlavic, possibly trace- \nable to central Asia, \nthence to India. The Si- \namese still call a \nlunar sabbath day vam- \npra. As in early \nGreece, there were two \nvampra sabbaths in \neach lunar month, at \nthe new moon and \nfull moon, with lesser \nsabbaths on the quar- \nters to make four \nseven-day weeks.\' 1 \n\n\n\nEver since Homer\'s time, western nations had the fixed idea that \nblood could recall the dead to life, at least temporarily. Regular \nsupplies of blood would impart a kind of life to the "un-dead," that is, \nvampires. They were called forth by the moon, their original Mother, \nwho also called forth the blood that made the living. Since the moon \nwas the original home of the dead and the source of rebirth, it was \nclosely associated with vampires. Breton churchmen, still not altogether \ncertain of the physiology of conception in the Middle Ages, claimed \nthat a woman who exposed her naked body to moonlight would \nconceive and bear a vampire child. 5 Yet common folk continued to \nexpress in their customs the older belief that the souls of all children \nwaited in the moon to be reborn. Scottish girls refused to be married \nat any time except during the full moon, for fear they otherwise might \nnot have children. New brides in the Orkneys went to a circle of \nmegalithic stones locally called the Temple of the Moon to pray for \nbabies. 6 \n\nThe idea that the moon provided vital force for both the living and \nthe dead persisted through the centuries, and reappeared as emphati- \ncally as ever in popular vampire literature only a hundred years ago. \nBoucicault\'s The Vampire instructed his servants to carry his body to \na high mountain where it could be touched by the first rays of the rising \nmoon. When this was done, the vampire sprang back to life, saying, \n"Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy \nthee!" 7 An English friar once said, "The moon is the mother of all \nhumors," and the body\'s most important life-giving "humor" was \nblood. 8 \n\nTherefore, vampires walked wherever the moon shone and they \nmight find blood; the church taught this, and no laymen dared to \ndoubt it. Balkan countries had certain wizards who specialized in \nbottling vampires, a technique they probably learned from Arabian \nmagicians who put djinn (Latin genii) into bottles or lamps, like the \nlamp of Aladdin. When a Bulgarian village panicked over a purport- \ned outbreak of vampirism, the specialist was called. He would solemnly \nidentify the offender\'s grave, bait his bottle with blood, catch the \nrestless spirit, cork him up, and burn the bottle. 9 \n\nThe Rev. Montague Summers mentions a sure cure for vampir- \nism, which would have been simple, and eliminated all the dramatic, \ntime-consuming, ultimately ineffective classical measures such as exor- \ncisms, crucifixes, garlic, silver bullets, stakes through hearts, and so \non. This simple solution was to place a consecrated host in a vampire\'s \ngrave, which would immobilize him forever. However, Summers \nsaid, this remedy "was not to be essayed, since it savors of rashness and \nprofanation of God\'s Body." 10 Summers, an earnest believer, evi- \ndently thought it was better to let a community be ravaged by \nmarauding vampires than to profane Eucharistic bread. \n\nSummers also attacked the rational doubts of Dom Calmet, \nwho wrestled with the physical improbabilities of vampirism two \n\n\n\n1040 \n\n\n\ncenturies earlier, asking questions that no one ever bothered to answer: Vampire \n\nHow can a corpse which is covered with four or five feet of earth, which \n\nhas no room even to move or to stretch a limb, which is wrapped in mi^mmmmmmimmmmmm \n\nlinen cerements, enclosed in a coffin of wood, how can it, I say, seek the \n\nupper air and return to the world walking upon the earth so as to cause \n\nthose extraordinary effects which are attributed to it? And after all that \n\nhow can it go back again into the grave, when it will be found fresh, \n\nincorrupt, full of blood exactly like a living body? Can it be maintained \n\nthat these corpses pass through the earth without disturbing it, just as \n\nwater and the damps which penetrate the soil or which exhale therefrom \n\nwithout perceptibly dividing or cleaving the ground? It were indeed to \n\nbe wished that in the histories of the Return of Vampires which have been \n\nrelated, a certain amount of attention had been given to this point, and \n\nthat the difficulty had been something elucidated. " \n\nRev. Summers quickly disposed of Dom Calmet\'s questions in \nthe accepted theological manner, not by answering them but by \ndenouncing the asking of them: \n\nThese difficulties which Dom Calmet with little perception has raised . . . \nare not only superficial but also smack of heterodoxy. . . . [OJne can \nhardly brush aside the vast vampire tradition. . . . Can the Devil endow a \nbody with those qualities ofsubtilty, rarification, increase, and diminish- \ning, so that it may pass through doors and windows? I answer that there is \nno doubt the Demon can do this, and to deny the proposition is hardly \northodox. \' 2 \n\nFrom the church\'s "vast vampire tradition," Summers conclud- \ned: "There can be no doubt that the vampire does act under satanic \ninfluence and by satanic direction." 1? This assertion was made not in \nthe 12th or 13th century, but in the year 1928. \n\nA thinly disguised reason for the never-failing popularity of vam- \npire stories was, of course, their suggestion of sinful sex. Kissing and \nbiting ran close together in both mental and actual behavior; and the \nattack of a male or female vampire on a victim of the opposite sex \nsurely bore some resemblance to a love-bite. One of the all-time classics \nof vampire literature, Prest\'s Varneythe Vampire, titillated Victorian \nmale readers with scenes more suggestive of rape than of demonology: \n\nThat young and beautiful girl exposed to so much terror . . . . Her \nbeautiful rounded limbs quivered with the agony of her soul. The \nglassy horrible eyes of the figure ran over that angelic form with a hideous \nsatisfaction horrible profanation.

M \n\nThe church sanctioned vampire superstitions in order to draw \nconverts through fear, and church rituals officially established the \nburning or piercing of suspected vampires in their graves. Even in the \npresent century this was still done by priests in the Balkans. 15 Jean- \nJacques Rousseau showed the evidence for the existence of vampires \n\n\n\n1041 \n\n\n\nVsrir \nVaruna \n\n\n\nresting on much the same foundations as the evidence for the existence \nof God: "If there ever was in the world a warranted and proven \nhistory, it is that of vampires; nothing is lacking, official reports, \ntestimonials of persons of standing, of surgeons, of clergymen, of \njudges; the judicial evidence is all-embracing." ,6 \n\nThe most famous fictional vampire of them all, Count Dracula, \ndid have a real history. He was a feudal baron of sadistic tempera- \nment, Vlad the Impaler, of the Little Dragon clan: that is, Dracule. He \nliked to impale his enemies on stakes, while he cut, roasted, and ate \npieces of flesh from their still-living bodies. 17 The fear engendered by \nthis monster was such that his serfs believed he would return to \nplague them even after his death. Of course no such revenant has ever \nreappeared, but the Count\'s clan nickname, at least, seems truly \nimmortal. \n\n1. Chagnon, 38. 2. Homer, 163. 3. Summers., V, 19. 4. Briffault 2, 425. \n5.

The warlike Aesir led by Father \nOdin moved into the territory of the Vanir and made war against them, \nbeginning with an act of cruelty: the Aesir seized and tortured their \nholy sorceress, Gullveig. 1 In the end the Vanir were conquered, but \nmany generations remained in awe of their miraculous powers. They \nwere said to have accomplished everything by magic, and invented all \nthe knowledge that the new gods learned. 2 \n\nWhether the Vanir were described as elder gods, giants, elves, \nmatriarchs, or "primal ancestresses," they seem to have represented \npre-patriarchal farming cultures who were forced to give way to nomad- \nic Aryan invaders. \n\n1.

He was sometimes female, sometimes an androgyne \nrepresenting sexual union. In this guise, he-she probably became the \nPersian Varan, a "spirit of concupiscence." Varuna was paired with \nMitra, a similar entity, a sister or male twin; from this deity evolved the \nPersians\' wholly masculinized Mithra. \n\n1 . Lxroussc, 328. \n\n\n\n1042 \n\n\n\nVas Hermeticum, Vas Spirituale \n\nAlchemical terms for the symbolic Grail, signifying the womb of \nmatter, a universal vessel of all transformations. The original symbol was \nthe "Vase" of life and death representing the womb of the Great \nGoddess Rhea Pandora. Among Christian mystics, Vas Spirituale was a \ncommon title of the virgin Mary. \n\n\n\nVas Hermeticum \nVenus \n\n\n\nVenus \n\nRoman name for the Great Goddess in her sexual aspect, derived \nfrom the eponymous mother of Venetian tribes of the Adriatic, after \nwhom the city of Venice was also named. "Veneration" and "ven- \nery" were further derivatives. Venery used to mean hunting; for, like \nher eastern counterpart Artemis, Venus was once a Lady of Animals, \nand her Horned God Adonis, both the hunter and the sacrificial \nstag became venison, which meant "Venus\'s son." J \n\nEarly Christian fathers denounced the temples "dedicated to the \nfoul devil who goes by the name of Venus a school of wickedness \nfor all the votaries of unchasteness." 2 What this meant was that they \nwere schools of instruction in sexual techniques, under the tutelage of \nthe veneriiox harlot-priestesses. 3 They taught an approach to spiritual \ngrace, called venia, through sexual exercises like those of Tantrism. 4 \n\nLike Tantric yogis, educated Romans envisioned the moment of \ndeath as a culminating sexual union, a final act of the sacred marriage \npromised by the religion of Venus. Ovid, an initiate, said he wished to \ndie while making love: "Let me go in the act of coming to Venus; in \nmore senses than one let my last dying be done." 5 Centuries later, in \nShakespeare\'s time, "to die" was still a common metaphor for sexual \norgasm. 6 An English treatise on interpretation of dreams said if a sick \nman dreamed of marrying a lovely maiden, it meant death. 7 When \nChristians said to die was to be gathered to the bosom of Christ or \nAbraham, they unwittingly based the concept on the ancient female \none. \n\nModern interpretations of classical mythology tend to picture \nVenus as a sex goddess only. Her birth-giving and death-giving \naspects have been suppressed; but they were equally important in her \ncult. As Queen of the Shades she was identified with Proserpine, but \nwent by the name of Libitina. Plutarch said Libitina was only another \nname for Venus, "the goddess of generation." 8 \n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, Venus became the ruling Fairy \nQueen of the magic mountains called Venusbergs. She also became \na Christian saint, St. Venerina, who never existed in human form but \nonly as a cult figure continuing the worship of the Goddess in \nCalabria. 9 In the Balkans she was called St. Venere, and is still invoked \nas a patron of marriage by young girls making a wish that they might \nfind good husbands. 10 The magic rhyme addressed to the planet Venus \n\n\n\n? \n\n\n\nSign of Venus \n\n\n\n1043 \n\n\n\nVenus Observa | as Evening Star still echoes down the centuries: "Star light, star \n\nVeronica, Saint bright, first star I see tonight, I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ I wish tonight." \n\n^^"^^^^^ Venus the Evening Star was also Stella Maris, Star of the Sea. In \n\nher sacred city of Venice, on Ascension Day each year, the Duke of \nVenice ceremonially married her by throwing a gold wedding ring into \nthe sea. 11 This practice continued through Renaissance times, even \nwhen the title of Stella Maris was assimilated to Mary. \n\n1 Potter & Sargent, 209. 2.

Thus it came to be known as the "mission- \nary position," and native couples often made fun of it in secret. \n\n1. Graves & Patai, 67. \n\n\n\nVeronica, Saint \n\nSt. Veronica was not a person but only a contraction of two Latin \nwords, vera iconica, "the true image." In 8th-century Rome, a cloth \nimprinted with a man\'s face appeared in St. Peter\'s basilica and was \nadvertised as the vera iconica of Christ. The legend invented to accoun \nfor it was that, as Jesus was carrying his cross, a woman named \nVeronica wiped the sweat from his face with her veil, which miraculous \nly took the image of the divine face. 1 \n\nSuch stories were not uncommon in the ancient world. An old \nGreek tale told of Pandarus the Thessalian, who had "shameful \nletters" on his brow until the god Asclepius miraculously removed then \nto a scarf that Pandarus bound on his forehead. 2 Another pagan tale \nwas adapted to the Veronican legends: the king of Edessa sent an artist \nto paint Jesus\'s portrait; but the artist couldn\'t see Jesus\'s face because \nof its blinding sunlike brightness. So he merely pressed a cloth to the \ndivine features, and the imprint rendered a perfect portrait. Another \nimpossible story claimed that Veronica\'s veil cured the emperor Tiberi- \n\n\n\n1044 \n\n\n\nus of sickness, so he carried it to Rome on a road entirely spread with \nsilk and installed it in the shrine where it was "found" eight centuries \nlater. 5 \n\nSt. Veronica\'s act of veil-imprinting is still included in the Stations \nof the Cross, though some churchmen recommended its elimination \non the ground that the legend\'s transparent fakery is becoming too well \nknown. 4 \n\n1.

Verthandi \nsignified the present, while her sisters Urth and Skuld stood for the past \nand future. 1 As the Weird Sisters, or Mothers of Fate (wyrd), they \ncorresponded to the Greek Moerae, Latin Fortunae, and other versions \nof the Triple Goddess. Verthandi also governed motherhood and the \nphases of the moon, like Kali the Preserver. \n\nl.Branston,209. \n\n\n\nVesica Piscis \n\n"Vessel of the Fish," a common yonic symbol, the pointed oval, \nnamed from the ancients\' claim that female genitals smelled like fish. \nMother Kali herself appeared in a Hindu story as "a virgin named \nFishy Smell, whose real name was Truth," like Egypt\'s Goddess Maat. 1 \nEgyptians said Abtu, the Abyss, was "a fish who swallowed the penis \nof Osiris," but this abyss was also "The Fish of Isis," therefore a sexual \nmetaphor. Aphrodite\'s principal rites at Paphos took place under the \nsign of Pisces, the Fish. Aphrodite, Isis, Freya, and other forms of the \nGoddess in sexual aspect appeared veiled in fish nets. 2 See Fish. \n\nThe vesica piscis was an unequivocally genital sign of the sheila- \nna-gig figures of old Irish churches. The squatting naked Goddess \ndisplayed her vulva as a vesica, as did the temple-door images of Kali in \nIndia. 3 One of the old pagan ideograms of sexual union was adopted \nby the church to represent the Feast of St. Nicholas on the runic \ncalendar: a vesica piscis enveloping a male furka. 4 \n\nThe pointed-oval fish sign was even used by early Christians to \nrepresent the mystery of God\'s union with his mother-bride which \nis why Jesus was called "the little Fish" in the Virgin\'s fountain. 5 \n\nThis female enclosure was much used in Christian art, especially \nas a superimposition on Mary\'s belly, with her child within. Some- \ntimes Christ at his ascension was shown rising into a heavenly vesica, as \nif returning to the Mother-symbol. The vesica was also shown as a \nframe for figures of Jesus, God, and saints. \n\nAnother name for the same sign was mandorla, "almond," which \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVesica Piscis \n\n\n\n1045 \n\n\n\nVestal Virgins \n\n\n\nalso represented a yoni.

Descendants of an ancient order of holy \nwomen who guarded the public hearth and altar, the Vestals were \nentrusted with keeping alight the perpetual fire that was the mystic heart \nof the empire. \n\nVestals were vkgines, i.e., women who vowed never to marry \nbecause they were brides of the spirit of Rome, in the same sense that \nChristian nuns were brides of Christ. Vestals underwent the same \nceremony that was later applied to nuns, to limit their magic female \npowers: they had their hair shaved off. 1 In an earlier era, however, they \nwere not so restricted. Like all other ancient priestesses who ruled by \nvirtue of magic and motherhood, the Vestals used to be the governing \nsisterhood of Latium. \n\nRhea Silvia or "Rhea of the Woodland" was called the First \nVestal; she was actually the Goddess Rhea transplanted to the Latin \ncolonies. According to Roman legend, she gave birth to Romulus and \nRemus, the founders of Rome. Their midwife, Acca Larentia, \nanother Vestal described as a "courtesan," gave birth to all the ancestral \nspirits the Romans called lares. (See Akka.) \n\nThe Vestals were never altogether virginal in the physical sense. \nTheir marriage to the phallic deity of the Palladium was physically \nconsummated in Vesta\'s temple, under conditions of great secrecy. The \nceremony was performed by a priest called the Pontifex Maximus, \n"great maker of the pons," which meant a bridge, a path, or a way. The \nPontifex Maximus had what Dumezil calls "an obscure, now un- \nknown duty" toward the Vestal Virgins. 2 One might suppose that his \n"way" was something like the Way of eastern sex-sacraments; that is, \nhe built the "bridge" between Father Heaven and Mother Earth \n(Vesta). \n\nThe office of Pontifex was adopted by Christians, and became a \n"pontiff," synonymous with "pope." The Vestals however were \nemphatically not adopted by Christians, although several of the details \nof their habit and lifestyle passed on to Christian convents. Pagans \nrevered the Vestals and were horrified by the way they were treated by \nChristian regimes in the 4th and 5th centuries. In 382 a.d., the \nendowments of all the pagan temples were withdrawn, including that of \nVesta\'s 600-year-old Mother-hearth. "Worst of all in the opinion of \nsome traditionalists, the fire on Vesta\'s hearth was to be permitted to go \nout: the Vestal Virgins were to lose their endowments and immunity \nfrom taxation, and all their privileges were to be taken away. The tiny \n\n\n\n1046 \n\n\n\norder of six Vestals was particularly hated by the Christians. . . . Their Vida \n\nChristian enemies feared them as mysterious and magical: they did not Vila \n\nunderstand them and did not want to do so; they wanted only to see m^^^^^^^^^mmt \nthem destroyed." 3 \n\n1.

Will \n\nSlavic witch-spirit associated with water; cognate of the Scandinavian \nVala or Valkyrie. Russian Vilas were sometimes known as Rusalki, \ndaughters of Holy Mother Russia (Earth). Like Valkyries, the Vilas \nof old had charge of the rites of death and the guiding of souls. \n\nSometimes, especially favored men were invited to join the Vilas \nfor a while, usually seven years. A man would be invited into a cave \nor hollow tree, and find himself in fairyland. He was "one who has won \nthe love of a Vila," and his title was Krstnik, a "Christ," which meant \nboth an Anointed One and an Accursed One. 1 That is, he was the \nSlavic version of the Enchanted Hunter (Chasseur Maudit), or \nThomas Rhymer, Tannhauser, etc. \n\nIn Dalmatia, a man associated with the Vilas was called Macieh, \nMessiah." He took the form of a youth in a Phrygian cap, like the \nIndo-Iranian sun-hero Mithra. 2 The female spirits he lived with were \nalso called krstaca, "crossed ones," from krst, a cross cognate with \nboth the Greek Christos and the Saxon "curst." The female spirits were \nalso known as Rogulja, "Horned Ones." 3 \n\n\n\n1047 \n\n\n\nVirginal, Ice Queen \nVirgin Birth \n\n\n\nVilas or Wilis came to be feared as angry, dangerous "souls of \ndrowned women" who dwelt in water, perhaps because so many \n"witches" were drowned. Like Sirens, they were supposed to draw into \nthe waters any heedless wayfarer who happened to see them dance by \nmoonlight. They still dance on modern stages in the classical ballet \nGiselle; the old fear of them resides in such phrases as "it gives me \nthe willies." A cold shudder was said to be a prophetic touch from a \nWili\'s deathly hand. However, traces of the priestesses\' former \nbenevolence are found in the legend that where they danced on the \nnights of the old pagan festivals, there the grass grew thicker and the \nwheat flourished more abundantly. 4 \n\n1.

She lived in the high Himalayas, an< \nsometimes came down to form alliances with men; but always she \nreturned to her lonely glaciers. In European folk tales, Virginal the Ice \nQueen lived alone in the pure upper snowfields of the mountains, \nbut once she descended to a valley to become the bride of a minstrel- \nwizard, Dietrich von Bern. Soon, however, she wearied of the \nlowlands and of him, and went back to her inviolable mountaintop, \nwhere "she still rules supreme." \' \n\nThe Norse version of Durga- Virginal was the death-goddess \nSkadi, who married the god Njord but grew tired of living with him \nin the lowlands by the sea, so she returned alone to her mountains. \nSome say she became the evil Snow Queen who would kidnap \nchildren from their homes and take away their souls. \n\nSince snow-covered mountains were widely associated with the \nmilk-giving breasts of Mother Earth, it is possible that Durga the \nInaccessible and similar Ice Queens represented the nursing Goddess, \nin the period when lactating human females, like lactating animal \nfemales, were literally inaccessible to the male. Preoccupied with \nmotherhood, the Goddess became "virgin" again in her refusal to \ntolerate male attentions. She "withdrew" from her marriage and went \naway to a place where no man could follow. There was an archetypal \nelement in these stories. As M.-L. von Franz has said, "One may \nsuddenly find oneself up against something in a woman that is \nobstinate, cold, and completely inaccessible." 2 \n\nI. Guerber, L.M.A., 115. 2. Jung, MRS., 189. \n\n\n\nVirgin Birth \n\n"Holy Virgin" was the title of harlot-priestesses of Ishtar, Asherah, or \nAphrodite. The title didn\'t mean physical virginity; it meant simply \n\n\n\n1048 \n\n\n\n"unmarried." The function of such "holy virgins" was to dispense \nthe Mother\'s grace through sexual worship; to heal; to prophesy; to \nperform sacred dances; to wail for the dead; and to become Brides of \nGod. \n\nChildren born of such temple women were called by the Semites \nbathur, by the Greeks parthenioi, "virgin-born." \' According to the \nProtoevangelium, the Virgin Mary was a kadesha and perhaps married \nto one of that class of priests known as "fathers of the god." 2 See \nFirstborn. \n\nMary\'s impregnation was similar to Persephone\'s. In her Virgin \nguise, Persephone sat in a holy cave and began to weave the great \ntapestry of the universe, when Zeus appeared as a phallic serpent, to \nbeget the savior Dionysus on her. 3 Mary sat in the temple and began \nto spin a blood-red thread, representing Life in the tapestry of fate, \nwhen the angel Gabriel "came in unto her" (Luke 1:28), the biblical \nphrase for sexual intercourse. Gabriel\'s name means literally "divine \nhusband." 4 \n\nHebrew Gospels designated Mary by the word almah, mistakenly \ntranslated "virgin," but really meaning "young woman." 5 It was \nderived from Persian Al-Mah, the unmated Moon-goddess. 6 Another \ncognate was Latin alma, "living soul of the world," virtually identical \nto Greek psyche, Sanskrit shakti. The Holy Virgins or temple-harlots \nwere "soul-teachers" or "soul-mothers" the alma mater. \n\nChristian translators insisted on rendering Mary\'s title as "virgin," \nwhich saddled their religion with an embarrassing article of faith. \nEven today, theologians like Karl Barth declare that "It is essential to the \ntrue Christian faith to accept the doctrine of the virgin birth" thus \ndrastically reducing the number of people who can be called true \nChristians. 7 \n\nEarly Christians demanded a virgin birth for their Savior out of \nsimple imitativeness. All the other Saviors had one, for they were \nborn of the Goddess incarnate in a chosen "virgin of the temple," \nwhose business it was to bear Saviors. The notion that mortal women \nwere impregnated by gods or spirits was a matter of everyday acceptance \nthroughout the ancient world. Even the Old Testament says the \narchaic "giants" (ancestral heroes) were born of mortal women impreg- \nnated by spirits that came from God (Genesis 6:4). \n\nZoroaster, Sargon, Perseus, Jason, Miletus, Minos, Asclepius, and \ndozens of others were God-begotten and virgin-born. Even Zeus, the \nHeavenly Father who begot many other "virgin-born" heroes, was \nhimself called Zeus Mamas, "Virgin-born Zeus." 8 Plutarch noted \namong the Egyptians the common belief that the spirit of God was \ncapable of sexual intercourse with mortal women. 9 \n\nHeracles was born of another almah, the Virgin Alcmene, whose \nname means Power of the Moon. 10 Her husband also, like the \nbiblical Joseph, kept away from her bed during her pregnancy. The \nsame tale was told of Plato, whose nephew affirmed that he was \n\n\n\nVirgin Birth \n\n\n\nThe temple hiero- \ndules were called \nvirgines or venerii in \nRome, horae in Greece, \nkadishtu, qadesh, or \nkadesha in Babylon, Ca- \nnaan, and Palestine. \n\n\n\n1049 \n\n\n\nVirgin Birth \n\n\n\nSt. Justin Martyr \n\nChristian apologist of \nthe 2nd century, \nborn of pagan parents \nand trained in philos- \nophy before his \nconversion. In addi- \ntion to his Apologia and \nDinlogus, many \nanonymous later works \nwere falsely attribut- \ned to his pen. \n\n\n\nbegotten by the god Apollo, his earthly parents having no sexual \nrelations until after his birth. 11 Christians believed this, and solemnly \nattested that Plato was a virgin-born son of the sun god. 12 \n\nAfter Christianity was established as the official religion of the \nRoman empire, however, church fathers tried to discredit all other \nvirgin births by claiming that the devil had devised them, and malicious- \nly placed them in a past time, so they would pre-date the real Savior. \nJustin Martyr wrote, "When I am told that Perseus was born of a virgin \nI realize that here again is a case in which the serpent and deceiver \nhas imitated our religion." 1? \n\nDespite the efforts of church fathers, the virgin birth of Jesus was \nneither the first nor the last such miracle given credence by Chris- \ntians. Priapic idols of antiquity, credited with the power to father \nchildren, actually fathered other priapic idols who became saints like \nFoutin, Gurtlichon, Gilles, Regnaud, and Guignole; these were credit- \ned with the same power of fertilization and were much adored by \nwomen who desired offspring. 14 Women of Tuscany and Portugal \nthought they could become pregnant by eating apples specially \nconsecrated by a priest. Spaniards remembered the virgin birth of Mars, \nand thought any woman could conceive like Mars\'s mother Juno, by \neating a lily. It was believed that souls could enter a woman\'s body in \nthe form of flies, worms, or serpents, to cause impregnation. Cases \nwere solemnly documented, like that of a Scot named Gillie Downak \nChravolick, conceived when his mother raised her skirts on an old \nbattlefield and received into her "private member" some ashes from the \nburned bones of dead warriors. 15 As impregnation by a god used to be \nthe "acceptable explanation for pregnancy in most pagan countries \nwhere the sexual act was part of the fertility rites," so Christians \nthought impregnation by spirits was still credible, whether the alleged \nfather was a dead hero, a devil, an incubus, or even in some sects \nthe Holy Ghost again. 16 \n\nSuch an untenable belief survived because it was important to \nmen. The impossible virgin mother was everyman\'s longed-for reso- \nlution of Oedipal conflicts: pure maternity, never distracted from her \ndevotion by sexual desires. Churchmen unwittingly showed their \nanxiety by denying even the evidence of their own Gospels that Jesus \nhad brothers and sisters. St. Ambrose insisted that Mary never \nconceived again, since God couldn\'t have chosen for his mother-bride \n"a woman who would defile the heavenly chamber with the seed of a \n\n\'17 \n\n\n\nman. \n\n\n\nTheologians in effect severed the two halves of the pagan God- \ndess, whose realistic femininity combined abundant sexuality and \nmaternity. One half was labeled harlot and temptress, the other a female \nascetic even in motherhood. The Goddess\'s old title, Sancta Ma- \ntrona Holy Mother was added to the canon of saints as a phony St. \nMatrona, whose pseudo-biography made her a "hermitess." 18 \n\n\n\n1050 \n\n\n\nThe primitive naivete of the virgin-birth concept was dressed in Virgo \n\npretentious verbiage, purporting to explain it, while actually hiding it Virtue \n\nfrom prying eyes. "A shadow is formed by light falling upon a body. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe Virgin, as a human being, could not hold the fulness of divinity; \nbut the power of the most High overshadowed her, while the incorpore- \nal light of the godhead took a human body within her, and so she was \nable to bear God." 19 \n\nChurchmen often presented the doctrine of the virgin birth as \n"ennobling" to women, since they viewed women\'s natural sexuality \nas degrading. Seldom were female sexuality and motherhood perceived \nas component parts of the same whole. Some women were astute \nenough to see that the doctrine effectively degraded real womanhood by \nexalting a never-attainable ideal. At the end of the 19th century one \nwoman wrote: \n\n/ think that the doctrine of the Virgin birth as something higher, sweeter, \nnobler than ordinary motherhood, is a slur on all the natural mother- \nhood of the world. . . . Out of this doctrine, and that which is akin to it, \nhave sprung all the monasteries and nuns of the world, which have \ndisgraced and distorted and demoralized manhood and womanhood for a \nthousand years. I place beside this false, monkish, unnatural claim . . . \nmy mother, who was as holy in her motherhood as was Mary herself. 20 \n\nl.Briffault3, 169-70. 2. Budge, D.N., 169. 3.

Renaissance poets still called her Astraea: "She is that royal \nand great goddess by whom cities and empires are preserved in pride; \nwithout her no kingdom can long endure. This is she who makes them \nall secure." 2 \n\n1 . Lindsay, O.A., 277. 2. Moakley, 111. \n\n\n\nVirtue \n\nLatin virtu was derived from vir, "man," and originally meant \nmasculinity, impregnating power, semen, or male magic, like Germanic \nheill. Patriarchal thinkers defined manliness as good and womanliness \nas bad, therefore virtu became synonymous with morality or godliness, \nalong with other synonyms hinting at male sexuality: erectness, \n\n\n\n1051 \n\n\n\nvishnu uprightness, rectitude, upstandingness, etc. As the Old Testament said, \n\nVitus, Saint "Praise is comely for the upright" (Psalms 33:1). \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ Old phallic connotations of "virtue" may have been hidden in the \n\n"^ Gospels\' description of Jesus\'s miraculous cure of the woman with an \n\nissue of blood. When she touched Jesus, he felt "virtue" go out of him, \n"and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up" (Mark \n5:29-30). According to ancient systems of sacred kingship, it was \nimportant for the king-victim to give proof of virility, which meant \nimpregnating a specially chosen priestess, so that the "fountain of her \nblood" might cease. \n\n\n\nVishnu \n\nVedic god representing both the sacrificial boar and the phallus. His \nname meant "he who embraces, pervades, or penetrates"; he was \nknown as "the expander," and "he who excites men." l His emblem \nwas a lingam-yoni composed of a male cross with a female circle, called \nthe sign Kiakra: "When held by Vishnu, it signifies his power to \npenetrate heaven and earth." 2 \n\nVishnu insisted that his flesh and blood, poured out on the \nsacrificial altar, preserved the whole world, creatures and gods alike. \nWhen he transformed himself into the boar, he became the Universal \nSavior. For the sake of the world he gave himself up to death, and \nwas sacrificed by "gods saying Om." ? \n\nThe boar\'s tusk was identified with his phallus, because it was the \ntusk that effected Vishnu\'s mating with the primal Goddess Earth: \n"He uprose bearing on his tusk the fair goddess Earth, shedding in all \ndirections the brine of the cosmic sea." 4 Boars\' tusks often represent- \ned phalli in Oceanic and Far-Eastern cultures. \n\n1.

An emblem of \nthe Moon-goddess entered into the fabrication of St. Vitus as his \nalleged "nurse," Crescentia. \n\nVitus was especially venerated in Westphalia, where bones said to \nbe his had rested since the 9th century a.d., though his legend \nassigned him to the time of Diocletian, six hundred years earlier. The \nbones were credited with the ability to cure many diseases, especially \nchorea, the so-called St. Vitus\'s Dance. 1 \n\nl.Atrwater,338. \n\n\n\n1052 \n\n\n\nViviana, Saint Viviana, Saint \n\nCanonized form of the pagan Goddess Viviane, whose name meant \n\nLife. It seems to have been nothing more than a word on the Goddess\'s i \n\ntemple on the Esquiline Hill in Rome. Probably an image of the \n\nGoddess, so labeled, was deliberately re-interpreted as the image of a \n\n"virgin martyr." 1 \n\nAmong early medieval Celtic poets, Viviane was the name of the \nLady of the Lake, who reappeared in Arthurian myths as another \nform of Nimue, the "Nemesis" of Merlin. \n\nl.Attwater, 338. \n\n\n\nVolsi \n\n"Horse\'s Penis," a title of Odin as the castrated royal horse, whose \namputated member became the ancestor of the Volsungs. Welsh \nequivalents were the Waelsings, sons of Waels, who later became \n"the god Wales." Waels also meant "the Corpse," for the dead god was \nalways resurrected and became the usual Lord of Death, like Shiva\'s \ncorpse-form Shava. See Horse. \n\n\n\nVulcan \n\nLatin lightning- or volcano-god derived from Cretan Velchanos, \nidentical with Hephaestus. Vulcan\'s forges were said to lie under Mt. \nEtna or Mt. Vesuvius. See Lightning; Smith. He evolved into the \nmedieval "Volund the Smith," a divine wizard whom the British called \nWayland. \n\n\n\nVulture \n\nOne of the oldest totems of the Great Mother in Egypt was the \nvulture, eater of the dead. Vultures who devoured corpses were regard- \ned as her angels of death, since they carried the dead piecemeal to \nheaven. In Neolithic times it was a common practice to expose dead \nbodies to carrion birds, who embodied the Mother\'s spirit. For this \nreason even the Greeks and Romans fostered a belief that all vultures \nare female. 1 On the Stele of the Vultures from Catal Huyuk, 7th \nmillenium B.C., dead bodies are carried off by vultures in a time and \nplace where only the female principle was worshipped. 2 \n\nAncient Iranians didn\'t bury their dead, but exposed them to \nvultures in open-topped "towers of silence" called dakhmas, many of \nwhich still stand today. Such towers were built when Iranians wor- \nshipped the Moon-goddess Mah, the Mother, and believed that \n\n\n\n1053 \n\n\n\nVulture vultures carried the deceased to her heavenly realm. 5 Even after burial \n\nwas instituted in Persia, a dead body couldn\'t be interred until it was \n^ ^^^ Im first torn by vultures.* \n\nEgyptians worshipped the vulture-headed Mother as the origin of \nall things, calling her Mut, Isis, or Nekhbet. 5 In combination with the \nserpent goddess Buto (Per-Uatchet), the vulture-mother gave rise to the \nTwo Mistresses, guardians of royal dynastic clans, and nurses of \ndeceased kings in the after-life. Temples had special chapels for the \nTwo Mistresses: on the east, the serpent Goddess brought the sun to \nbirth; on the west, the vulture Goddess daily ordained his death. 6 \nSometimes both Goddesses appeared as vultures on the sacred mount \nof Sehseh, where the deceased pharaoh became an eternal infant at \ntheir breasts. 7 \n\nEgypt\'s oldest oracle was the shrine of the vulture goddess Nekh- \nbet at Nekhen (modern Al-Kab), the original "necropolis" or city of \nthe dead. Because it was a birth shrine as well as a death shrine, Greeks \ncalled it Ilithyiaspolis after their own Great Mother of childbirth, \nAphrodite Ilithyia. 8 Romans called it Civitas Lucinae, the city of Juno \nLucina, Goddess of childbirth. 9 \n\nEgypt\'s symbol for "grandmother" was the vulture goddess bear- \ning a flail of authority: a totemic form of the pre-dynastic clan \nmatriarch. 10 The word "mother" was written in hieroglyphics with the \nsign of the vulture. 11 Nekhbet the Vulture once ruled all of Upper \nEgypt, wearing the white crown in token of sovereignty. As Isis, she \nappeared in vulture form on mummy-pillows, crowned with a vulture \nskin and bearing in each claw the ankh or Cross of Life. 12 As a vulture \nshe devoured her dead consort Osiris, just as Kali devoured her dead \nShiva. 13 Then she reincarnated him in her body, and gave him rebirth \nas a new Holy Child, Horus. \n\nOsiris was dismembered, which was the funerary custom of primi- \ntive Egypt, dating from a remote time when the dead probably were \neaten, after the manner of primitive Greece\'s omophagia. Funerary \nmagic lay in the hands of dancing priestesses called muu, "mothers," \nwho may have worn costumes of vulture feathers to represent "eaters" \nand, like Isis, reconstitute the dead in their own bodies. The Book of \nAni said the first gate of the uterine underworld was guarded by the \nvulture Goddess, whose tearing beak could admit the dead to the \nplace whence they rose again. 14 \n\nThe vulture-mother was known also in northern Europe and Asia. \nValkyries were "corpse-eaters" to the Saxons and often took the form \nof carrion-eating birds such as crows or ravens. In Siberia, each shaman \nhad a "Bird-of-Prey Mother" who appeared twice in his life, at his \nspiritual death-and-rebirth like the Dove-mother appearing at Jesus\'s \nbaptismal ceremony and again at his physical death. This spirit- \nmother was a large carrion bird "with an iron beak, hooked claws, and a \nlong tail." 15 \n\nFunerary priestesses came to be called "dirty" in classic myths, as \n\n\n\n1054 \n\n\n\nthey appear in the tale of the vulture-feathered Harpies. However, Vulture \n\nthe ancient claim that all vultures are female was believed well into the \n\nChristian era. Church fathers cited, in defense of the Virgin Birth, ^ ^ m M \n\nthe "fact" that vultures conceived their eggs only because they were \n\nfertilized by spirits of the wind. 16 \n\nl.Budge,G.E.2,372. 2. de Riencourt, 24. 3.

Saint Walburga \n\n\n\nWalpurga, Saint \n\nChristianization of the pagan Goddess of Walpurgisnacht (May \nEve), the orgiastic festival of the springtime sacred marriage. Walpurga \nwas the May Queen whose cult remained so popular in Germany \nthat the church had to adopt her in its usual way, by a spurious \ncanonization. According to the canonical legend, she was an English- \nwoman who became supreme abbess of the double monastery of \nHeidenheim during the 8th century; but there were no contemporary \nrecords of the time when this "abbess" was supposed to have lived and \nreigned. 1 \n\nIn the 8th century, however, double monasteries largely perpetuat- \ned the pagan traditions of the "colleges" of priests and priestesses \nliving together under a female ruler, and apparently carrying on the \nancient sex rites under a thin veil of Christian-pagan syncretism. 2 \n(See Convent.) The name of Walpurga\'s monastery means literally \n"home of heathens." \n\nThe medieval church produced and sold vast quantities of an \nallegedly miraculous Oil of St. Walpurga, which exuded so it was \nclaimed from the holy rock under which the saint\'s bones lay, and \nwhich was highly recommended for the purpose of healing many \nkinds of diseases. 3 \n\nThe saint\'s day was transferred from May Eve to February, \npossibly in an attempt to discourage the Walpurgisnacht revels; but \n"witches" celebrated the original date of the marriage-festival anyway, \nin honor of Walpurga. Therefore the church had to claim that May \nEve commemorated the transfer of St. Walpurga\'s relics to Eichstatt so \nthe processions and dances and songs would seem to be associated \nwith the progress of a revered reliquary. 4 May Eve, however, remained \na prime festival of witches throughout all Europe. \n\n1.

Attwater, 339. \n\n\n\nWar \n\nA primary patriarchal contribution to culture, almost entirely absent \nfrom the matriarchal societies of the Neolithic and early Bronze Ages. 1 \nEven when Goddess-worship was beginning to give way to cults of \naggressive gods, for a long time the appearance of the Goddess imposed \npeace on all hostile groups. Among Germanic tribes in Europe, \nTacitus said, whenever the Goddess moved in her chariot at certain \nseasons to certain sacred places, the people "do not go to battle or \nwear arms; every weapon is under lock; peace and quiet are known and \nwelcomed." 2 In later centuries, one of the reasons for the devaluation \nof women in feudal Europe was that the feudal system was based on \nwar, in which women played no part except as victims. 3 \n\nPatriarchal gods tended to be warlike from their inception \n\n\n\n1058 \n\n\n\nincluding, or even particularly, the Judeo-Christian God. Stanton \nobserved that the Old Testament\'s account of God\'s nature, purpose, \nand activities on behalf of his Chosen People boils down to "a long \npainful record of war, corruption, rapine, and lust. Why Christians who \nwished to convert the heathen to our religion should send them these \nbooks, passes all understanding." 4 \n\nBut Christianity was never a pacifist religion. The church placed \nwarfare in its armory of persecution as soon as its political power \nmade this possible. Pope Innocent I (d. 417) proclaimed that God gave \nthe church the right to kill, and permitted papal armies to employ the \nsword "for the punishment of the guilty," which meant massacre of the \nnonorthodox. 5 The warfare of Christian sect against Christian sect \nwas unremitting, so that pagan observers said Christians behaved toward \neach other with the ferocity of wild beasts. 6 These trends continued \nthroughout the Christian era, under the headings of holy wars, crusades, \nconquests, and conversions by the sword. All-male Christianity was \ndisseminated by violence. 7 \n\nMeanwhile, with the decline of their religious power and the \nobliteration of their Goddess, women helplessly disapproved, as many \ndo today. An American black woman recently said: \n\n/ don \'t think a few should control everything. I don \'t think it\'s right that \nwomen lay down and bear sons and then you have a few rich people \nthat tell your sons they have to go and die for their country. They\'re not \ndying for their country. They\'re dying for the few to stay on top. I don \'t \nthink that\'s necessary. I\'m just tired of this type of thing. I just think we \nought to be just human. s \n\nIn contrast to these sentiments, there was a more masculine \nopinion published in Marinetti\'s "manifesto of futurism" in the follow- \ning terms: "we want to extol the love of danger. . . . There is no \nbeauty apart from conflict. There are no masterpieces without aggres- \nsion. . . . We want to extol war the world\'s only hygiene \nmilitarism, patriotism, the anarchist\'s destructive gesture, the glorious, \ndeath-giving ideas and contempt for women!" 9 \n\nSome women accepted the contempt and tamely submitted to the \nGod and the man who extolled war, even giving up their children \nwithout protest, like housewife Jesusita Novarro: \n\nI pray a lot. I pray to God to give me strength. If He should take a child \naway from me, to have the strength to accept it. It\'s His kid. He just \nborrowed him to me. . . . \n\nThese kids don \'t ask to be born these kids are gonna grow up and \ngive their lives one day. . . . There will always be war. Why? I really \ndon \'t know. Nobody has ever told me. . . . I wish I knew. I guess the big \nshots decided the war. ,0 \n\nMore articulate women have spoken out against the "big shots" \nwho seem to leave the life-affirming interests of women out of their \nplans for the future, calling their power-mania gynocidal and therefore \n\n\n\nWar \n\n\n\nFilippo Tommaso \nMarinetti (1876-1944) \nItalian founder of the \nliterary Futurist move- \nment; supporter of \nFascism; self-described \nas a "mystic of \naction." \n\n\n\n1059 \n\n\n\nWar \n\n\n\ngenocidal. 11 It is often implied that only women can take on the \nresponsibility of defying the war machines, to save their children; but \nagain women are placed in a no-win situation when they have no \npower to enforce their defiance. \n\nWith the advance of technological civilization, as everyone \nknows, wars have become deadlier than ever, as if the mind of man \nbecomes less "civilized" as his tools become more so. Some have \ndoubted that man is capable of constructing a stable, peaceful world. \nBecker remarked, "It seems that the experiment of man may well \nprove to be an evolutionary dead end, an impossible animal." n Jules \nHenry said: \n\nIs there nothing in life in an achieving culture but constant war war \nagainst the outside as the fullest expression of the drive, and war on the \ninside to contain and transform it? The grisly history of achieving cultures \ndoes not permit anything but the affirmation: No, there is nothing \nmore. Though the inner and the outer war continue, the outer has so far \nbeen most successful, and the history of the achievement drive shows \nthat Homo sapiens has been dying of success and will probably fail as a \nspecies because of it. n \n\nTeilhard de Chardin wondered whether some historical error \nmight have brought man to a wrong turning in the path of progress, so \nthat violence of the modern world betrays "a certain excess, inexpli- \ncable to our reason, as if to the normal effect of evolution is added the \nextraordinary effect of some catastrophe or primordial deviation." H It \nis not difficult to find such a deviation in the contrast between "matrist" \nand "patrist" societies, especially in their respective valuations of \nelemental caring behavior. \n\nThe fundamental problem of mankind is to develop a culture where the \nneeds of the individual are always complementary to those around him; \na culture in which a child is not slapped for crying; a culture in which \nsorrow always is met by the complementary need to be compassionate; \nwhere fear is always met by the complementary need in others to give \nreassurance; where the need to be loved is met by a need to give love in \nthe way it is wanted, at the time it is wanted and as much as it is wanted. \nThis is not an American view, for the American makes conflict into a \ngod; and although sociology swells its chest with a thousand "conflict \ntheories, "it has none on compassion. . . . Life without conflict seems \nstale to the American elites; and compassion, which is a low-paid motiva- \ntion, has been relegated to the fringes of the low-paid segments of the \nculture, and has never been a subject for research. ,s \n\nThe highest-paid pursuits of the modern age tend to exploit \nviolence either directly or in symbol, as Arthur Miller observed: \n\nThere is violence because we have daily honored violence. Any half- \neducated man in a good suit can make his fortune by concocting a \ntelevision show whose brutality is photographed in sufficiently monstrous \ndetail. Who produces these shows, who pays to sponsor, who is \nhonored for acting in them? Are these people delinquent psychopaths \n\n\n\n1060 \n\n\n\nslinking along tenement streets? No, they are the pillars of society, our War \n\nhonored men, our exemplars of success and social attainment. We must \n\nbegin to feel the shame and contrition we have earned before we can ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nbegin to sensibly construct a peaceful society, let alone a peaceful world. A \n\ncountry where people cannot walk safely in their own streets has not \n\nearned the right to tell any other people how to govern itself, let alone to \n\nbomb and burn that people. 16 \n\nSome observers of the modern scene fear that the symbolism of \nviolence, so prevalent in what passes for "entertainment" in our \naggressive society, will actually create its social counterpart because of \nman\'s propensity to model his behavior on symbolic forms. Mumford \nsays: \n\nPower and order, pushed to their final limit, lead to their self-destructive \ninversion: disorganization, violence, mental aberration, subjective \nchaos. This tendency is already expressed in America through the motion \npicture, the television screen, and children \'s comic books. These forms \nof amusement are all increasingly committed to enactments of cold- \nblooded brutality and physical violence: pedagogical preparations for \nthe practical use of homicide and genocide. . . . Was it not in the country \nmost disciplined by militarism, absolutism, and physical science that \nsystematic torture in the form of "scientific experiments" was undertaken? \nDid not Germany produce the nauseating horrors of the extermination \ncamps? In the combination of cold scientific rationalism with criminal \nirrationalism the fatal poison produced its equally fatal antidote. \' 7 \n\nThe rise of Hitler\'s Germany provides an interesting case in \npoint, showing a nation swept by militaristic sentiment coupled with a \nsense of divine mission. The churches accepted Hitler\'s warmonger- \ning with religious joy. In April 1937, a Christian organization in the \nRhineland passed a resolution that Hitler\'s word was the law of God \nand possessed "divine authority." Reichsminister for Church Affairs \nHans Kerrl announced: "There has arisen a new authority as to what \n\nChrist and Christianity really are that is Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler \n\nis the true Holy Ghost." 18 And so the pious gave him their blessing, and \nthe churches gave him God\'s. "Organized religion has always man- \naged to provide prayers and thanks for victories in bloody wars. ... In \nmore recent history, is there any evidence that organized religion \nanywhere did anything but bless the battlers on both sides?" 19 \n\nIn fact, Nazism was not the creation of Hitler alone, nor even of \nGermany alone. The Nazi myth of "pure Aryanism" began not with \na German but with a Frenchman, Comte de Gobineau, who claimed in \n1853 that the divinely chosen Master Race, of Teutonic stock, had \nbeen defiled by admixtures of inferior, swarthy peoples: Latins, Ne- \ngroes, Semites. Teutons would "naturally" rule the world once these \ninferior strains were purged from their Aryan bloodlines. \n\nGermans founded Gobineau societies all over their country, and \ndeveloped a new nationalistic pride out of the myth of the Teutonic \nUbermensch. The myth was further elaborated by an Englishman, \n\n\n\n1061 \n\n\n\nWar \n\n\n\nH. S. Chamberlain, who wrote The Foundation of the Nineteenth \nCentury in 1899, giving a "scientific" rationale for the awful conse- \nquences of racial mixture, especially the contamination of "exalted \nAryans" by Semitic blood. Chamberlain married Wagner\'s daughter \nEva, and became a German citizen. Kaiser Wilhelm praised him, and \ncalled Chamberlain\'s book his favorite reading. Clearly, it was also a \nfavorite of Hitler\'s. \n\nThe Gobineau-Chamberlain-Hitler theory of the Ubermensch \nshows one of the most common underlying causes of war: man\'s \npropensity to view himself and his own group as superior to others, who \ntherefore deserve destruction because they are substandard. Once the \npropaganda machine begins to work, there is no limit to the depravity it \ncan impute to the enemy not wholly without reason, for war \ncorrupts everyone including one\'s own troops, though this fact is \ninvariably overlooked. War is an outstanding example of the We- \nThey syndrome: the Saved versus the Damned, the Chosen People \nversus the heathen, God\'s champions against the forces of evil (even \nwhen God is on both sides). Hitler succeeded brilliantly in convincing \nhis followers that his political enemies were subhumans (Untermens- \nchen), therefore it was only reasonable to exterminate them. 20 \n\nIn a sense this indoctrination can extend even to the enemy\'s \nhomeland, which can be seen as a non-country whereas according \nto the patriotic ideal one\'s own country is the most superior spot on \nMother Earth\'s body, the essential cunnus as primitives believed, a \nparadise on earth. Such maternal symbolism has even been used to good \neffect in developing desirable sentiments of aggression in wartime, as \nshown by the writing of a California superintendent of schools: \n\nThe good citizen stands in relation to his country as the good son to his \nmother. \n\nHe obeys her because she is his elder, because she conjoins within \nherself the vision of many, and because he owes to her his begetting \nand his nurturing. \n\nHe honors her above all others, placing her in a special niche within \nhis secret heart, in front of which the candles of respect and admiration \nare forever kept alight. \n\nHe defends her against all enemies, and counts his life well lost in \nher behalf 21 \n\nSuch utilization of the powerful Mother-symbol on behalf of \nmilitarism tends to conceal the real aggressors from their real victims. As \nwomen seem to know almost instinctively, the former are the "big \nshots" mature men in positions of power. The latter are the younger, \nhandsomer, more virile rivals the sons who can be made obedient \nsoldiers and sent off to be destroyed, which may defuse the Oedipal \njealousy. In effect, war is a gentlemen\'s agreement between the \nauthority figures on both sides that they will kill off each other\'s youths, \nand even win social approval or adulation for doing so. 22 \n\n\n\n1062 \n\n\n\nPatriarchal males have always shown hostility to the young, who War \n\ndivert the attention of females, either as mates or mothers. In the \n\nwest, male aggression against the young is sometimes projected onto ^^^mm^^ma^^m \n\nwomen: for example, accusing women of murder in the case of \nabortion, or of crime in the case of birth control. Both these measures \ntended to diminish the patriarchs\' supply of cannon fodder. Margaret \nSanger thought women could end war by "cutting off the surplus \npeople. Of course military states always clamor for more children, \nfirst to defend the Fatherland, and when the population soars, to \nconquer more territory for the added millions." 23 But the goals of a \nmilitaristic state would not be served by women who deliberately denied \nit the necessary population base; the state wanted quantity, not \nquality. \n\nReligion of the patriarchal sort was, and is, always on the side of \nthe patriarchs. Vetter says, "There is little to choose between the \nhead-hunting which keeps down the number of people to be supported \nby the game produced in a given area, and the periodic wholesale \nslaughter engaged in by \'civilized\' peoples in their battles for the control \nof equally vital economic resources, and for which slaughters the \nblessings of our religions have never failed to be forthcoming." 24 \n\nWars are begun by elite males and carried out by those of lower \nstatus, while priesthoods bless the effort. "It is a fair estimate that 100 \nmillion people have been killed by war since 1900. Responsibility for \nthis mass slaughter rests directly upon the male members of the \nspecies." 25 Yet war is never reasonable, as males imagine their actions to \nbe. "Destruction of the world by a small group of white men in order \nto achieve more wealth than they can ever possibly use does not make \nsense. We are talking here about a drive for power, a need for \ndomination that must be examined. ... In squelching female energy, \npatriarchy creates a culture that is destructive and death-oriented." 26 \nToday "we see the threat of nuclear annihilation more serious than ever \nafter two decades of disarmament efforts. We realize that science and \ntechnology cannot save us, at least not as currently administered by \nmen. The design for disaster we currently face was not planned by \nwomen." 27 \n\nIn the Tantric morality which probably was planned by women, at \nleast in part, war is entirely unacceptable. The adept may not \nparticipate in fighting or in the manufacture of weapons; he must not \nglorify soldiers\' bravery, nor praise killing in a hunt or a battle. These \n"constitute a worse form of murder since they incite others to do it, thus \nharming their spiritual growth." 28 With modern films and television \nstill trying to glorify violence, it seems the Tantric sages had already \nachieved a deeper understanding of human nature than those of our \n"enlightened" modern world. \n\nl.Fromm, 158. 2.

Tatz & Kent, 3 1 . \n\n\n\nWaste Land \n\nThe recurrent threatening theme of medieval romances was the \nWaste Land motif, especially in the Holy Grail cycle. Like the Grail \nlegends themselves," the Waste Land motif probably came from the \nMiddle East, where European travelers and crusaders had seen a true \nWaste Land: the great desert which eastern mystics attributed to \nIslam\'s renunciation of the fertile Great Mother. Western pagans also \nmaintained that if the Mother should be offended or neglected, she \nmight curse the land with the same desperate barrenness that could be \nseen in Arabia Deserta and north Africa. (See Grail, Holy.) \n\nOne of the Grail stories said a king of England (Logres) once \ncommitted a mortal sin by raping one of the Goddess\'s priestesses \nand stealing her golden cup, symbol of her love, which must not be \nstolen but only given. Afterward, priestesses of the sacred springs no \nlonger welcomed wayfarers with food and drink. 1 The Peace of the \nGoddess was destroyed, for the women no longer trusted men. "The \nland went to waste. The trees lost their leaves, grass and flowers \nwithered, and the water receded more and more. ... [A] wrong \nagainst a feminine being and a plundering of nature were perpetrated. . . . \n[T]he origin of the trouble was looked upon as an offense committed \nagainst the fairy world, i.e., actually against nature. . . . The growth of \nmasculine consciousness and of the patriarchal logos principle of the \nChristian outlook are concerned in no small measure with this \ndevelopment." 2 \n\nThe Goddess appeared in several myths of the Grail cycle as a \ngreat lady disinherited, or a queen robbed of her possessions and \nreduced to penury, like La Reine de la Terre Gaste (Queen of the \nWaste Land) in the Cistercian romance of the Queste del Saint Graal} \nMany tales speak of groups of women deprived of their former property \nrights and gathered together in "castles of damsels," under three rulers \npersonifying the Goddess: a queen, her daughter, and her \ngranddaughter. \n\nHoping to keep their enemies at bay by magic spells, the woman \nwaited for a champion to defend their cause, as the Grail knights were \nsupposed to do. The queen employed a certain learned astronomer \nwhose wizardry kept away from the castle any knight likely to fail \nthrough cowardice, envy, greed, or any other weakness of character. \nThe ladies waited for the coming of their savior, the Desired Knight, \nperfect in his honesty and bravery: one who could destroy all their \nenemies and restore their lands and possessions, which had been taken \nfrom them by various robber barons. "Orphaned maidens," deprived of \n\n\n\n1064 \n\n\n\ntheir inheritance by new patrilineal laws, also took refuge in such castles Waste Land \n\nof women; so did older widows who were no longer permitted to inherit \n\nproperty as under the former laws of mother-right. 4 m ^^^ mt ^ m ^^^ mm \n\nLegends of the coming of the Desired Knight may have been \npromulgated by women, or by bards seeking to please women with a \nfavorite theme. But there was more than this to the image of the Waste \nLand. It haunted a society in which, "Under the autocratic regime of \npersecuting Christianity during the Middle Ages of Europe, Christian \ndogma was indeed accepted nominally by great intellects, but it was \naccepted under duress and with a reservation. . . . The men of highest \nintellect were compelled to express the faith that was in them in the \nmost guarded language." 5 Often, the language was symbolism the \nmost guarded of all, since its true meaning could always be denied. The \nsymbolic Waste Land was "a landscape of spiritual death," where \nreligious concepts were dissociated from the feelings and life experi- \nences of ordinary people, and imposed upon a confused, reluctant \npublic only by authoritarian indoctrination. 6 \n\nThis could well describe Europe in the 1 2th century, when the \ncoming of the Desired Knight was vaguely identified with the second \ncoming of Christ or Merlin, Arthur, Frederick, etc. Many oppressed \npeople despairingly yearned for a powerful hero to defy the oppressors \non their behalf. The Waste Land theme invoked the collective fear of \nevery agricultural society since the Stone Age: the fear that Mother \nEarth\'s cyclic miracle of food production might fail. But it meant more \nthan that. It also stood for collective devitalization and depression in a \nsociety perceived by its members as lacking spiritual roots. \n\nA famous modern application of the Waste Land theme is, of \ncourse, T.S. Eliot\'s poem, based not only on western applications of \nGrail symbolism but also on the Hindu tale of the hopeless quest for the \ntrue Word of Power, as recounted in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. \nThe Hindu version ran like this: \n\nGods, men, and demons went to Shiva-Prajapati in the guise of \nLord of Thunder, to find out from him the ultimate word that is, the \nword signifying the goal and end of all things, as Om signified their \nbeginning. But the Thunder, being thunder, was not able to say any \nword except one: Da. \n\nMen, hearing this word, thought it meant datta, meaning "give" or \n"fertilize," because begetting was the only divine thing they could do, \nand charitable giving was the only way they knew to seek blessedness. \nDemons, hearing this word, thought it meant dayadhvam, meaning \n"sympathize" or "be compassionate"; in the Oriental context demons \nwere not evil spirits but deities of the old matriarchal religion, who \npreached karuna, mother-love. Gods, hearing this word, thought it \nmeant damyata, meaning "control," the secret of their success; by self- \ncontrol they became divine, and by divinity they achieved power to \ncontrol all the others. \n\nBut the Lord of Thunder couldn\'t distinguish one word from \n\n\n\n1065 \n\n\n\nWater another. He only repeated mindlessly the only word he knew: "Da! Da! \n\nWeird Sisters Da!" 7 \n\n1 Spence 138. 2. Jung & von Franz, 202, 204. 3. Campbell, CM., 543. \n^^^"^^^^ i. Jung &\'von Franz, 229. 5.

Upanishads, 112. \n\n\n\nWater \n\nFirst of the elements, according to the philosophers of ancient \nMiletus; the Arche, mother of all things. 1 Water gave birth to "spirit," \nsupposedly a male principle; hence the idea of baptismal rebirth that \nChristians copied from the pagans involved both water (feminine) and \nspirit (masculine). The baptismal font was described as a "womb," \nspecifically the womb of Mary, whose name was that of all the ancient \nSea-goddesses. 2 Most myths placed the primary impulse of creation \nin a watery womb of chaos or "formlessness" representing the Great \nMother (Tiamat, Kali, Ma-Nu, Themis, etc.), an image really drawn \nfrom the lack of differentiation between self and other or self and \nmother experienced by the infant in the womb and subconsciously \nremembered throughout life as an archetypal image. The Mother-letter \nM (Ma) was an ideogram for waves of water. \n\n"Students of mythology find that when the feminine principle is \nsubjected to sustained attack, as it was from the medieval Christian \nauthorities, it often quietly submerges. Under the water (where organic \nlife began) it swims through the subconscious of the dominant male \nsociety, occasionally bobbing to the surface to offer a glimpse of the \nrejected harmony." 3 \n\nCorrespondence between "water" and "mother" was so universal \neven in the Middle Ages, when the maternal principle was theoreti- \ncally squelched, that the Hermetic magicians and other "philosophers" \nclaimed souls were created not by God, but by the maternal earth and \nmaternal waters. 4 Goddess-shrines were nearly always associated with \nwells, springs, lakes, or seas. 5 The Lady of the Lake was identical with \nMinne/Aphrodite, the Minnesingers\' Goddess of Love, who appeared \nas a mermaid and was assumed to have a "nature of water." Often, \nwater was a metaphor for love itself. Like water, love stayed with the \nman who held it loosely, as in an open, cupped hand; but the man \nwho tried to grip it hard, in his fist, found that it flowed away and left \nhim gripping nothing. And water, like love, was essential to the life- \nforces of fertility and creativity, without which the psychic world as well \nas the material world would become an arid desert, the Waste Land. \n\n1.

Weird was a Saxon name of the death-goddess or \n\nCrone, who often stood for the whole trinity. Her name was variously ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ngiven as Wyrd, or Wurd, or Urd, meaning both "Earth" and the Word \n\nof Fate\'s immutable law. 1 As Beowulf said, "Every man in this life \n\nwill go lay him down on the bed where Wyrd has decided to nail him." 2 \n\nThis passage from an early Saxon romance might throw light on \nthe eastern yogi\'s celebrated bed of nails, symbol of his submission to \nthe Goddess. Devotion to the Fates and their decrees often brought \nforth a "passionate surrender" in both eastern and western mystics: \n"This eagerness to submit to divine Fate inspired certain souls in days of \nold with feelings so fervent as to recall the rapture of Christian \ndevotion, which burns to subject itself to the will of God." 3 Fate was \nkarma, a concept virtually identical with that of Weird. \n\nBeowulf was written in a pagan era, but it received later Christian \nadditions. For instance, Beowulf said once that the Goddess Wyrd \nwould determine the outcome of his battle; then he said that God \nwould. The Triple Goddess was much opposed by churchmen of the \ntime. A 12th-century Bishop of Exeter scolded his people for inviting \nthe Three Sisters into the house after a birth, to cast a good destiny \nfor the newborn, and making offerings to them on a table prepared \n"with three knives for the service of the fairies." 4 \n\nNevertheless, the Fairy Godmothers or Weird Sisters continued to \nbe invited. Four centuries later in Tudor England, they were still \nprayed to appear at the cradle of a newborn infant, "for to set to the \nbabe what shall befall to him." 5 \n\n1. Campbell, Oc.M., 485. 2.

Hazlirt, 379. \n\n\n\nWells \n\nSprings, fountains, ponds, wells were always female symbols in \narchaic religions, often considered water-passages to the underground \nwomb, in northern Europe associated with Mother Hel, whose name \nalso gave rise to "holy" and "healing." Many pagan sacred springs \nthroughout England received the name of Helen\'s Well during \nChristian times, and churchmen claimed all these wells were named \nafter Empress Helena, Constantine\'s sainted mother. But the real \n"Helen" was Hel, or Dame Holle, whose water-womb was called the \nsource of all the children on earth. 1 \n\nThere were also many wells named after the Goddesses Morgan \nand Brigit. Coventina, "Mother of the Covens," was associated with \nhealing wells. Margaret, a traditional witch name, also designated wells \nand springs. Lancashire legend speaks of a statue called Peg o\' the \nWell beside a formerly holy spring in Ribblesdale, said to claim a human \nsacrifice every seven years. 2 Ecclesiastical canons of the 10th century \n\n\n\n1067 \n\n\n\nWerewolf \n\n\n\nexpressly forbade "well-worshippings," but they continued \nnonetheless. 5 \n\nThe Danish poem Water of Life drew on the pagan tradition of \nresurrection through the Mother-symbol of a sacred well called \nHileva (Hel-Eve). With this magic water, a divine queen put her \ndismembered lover back together and made him live again, as Isis did \nfor Osiris. 4 The grotto and fountain of Lourdes once had a similar \npagan tradition, now revamped to the service of the church. \n\nIn 1770 a curate of Brpmlield forbade pagan ceremonies, wakes, \nand fairs at a spring calle<rHellywell (Hel\'s Well), to which site the \nceremonies had been moved after they were evicted from the church- \nyard at a still earlier date. 5 The ceremonies had been going on for a \nvery long time. A medieval Life of St. Columba mentioned them in \nconnection with a fountain-shrine "famous among this heathen \npeople, which foolish men, blinded by the devil, worshipped as a \ndivinity." 6 \n\n1.

Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the an- \ncient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\nWerewolf \n\nBelief in the werewolf, or "spirit-wolf," probably began with early- \nmedieval wolf clans who worshipped their totemic gods in wolf form, as \ndid some people of the Greco-Roman world centuries earlier. Zeus \nLycaeus, or Lycaeon, was a Pelasgian wolf-king who reigned in a nine- \nyear cycle as spouse of the Ninefold Goddess, Nonacris. 1 Virgil said \nthe first werewolf was Moeris, spouse of the trinitarian Fate-goddess \n(Moera), from whom he learned secrets of magic, including the \nnecromantic knack of calling up the dead from their tombs. 2 \n\nLycanthropy (werewolfism) was named for Apollo Lycaeus, \n"Wolfish Apollo," who used to be worshipped in the famous Ly- \nceum or "Wolf-temple" where Socrates taught. 3 Apollo was mated to \nArtemis as a divine Wolf Bitch at Troezen, where she purified \nOrestes with the blood of nine sacrificial victims. 4 Pausanias said Apollo \nwas originally an Egyptian deity, deriving his name from Up-Uat \n(Ap-ol), a very ancient name of Anubis. 5 (See Dog.) \n\nAnother Roman version of the wolf god was Dis Pater, Soranus, or \nFeronius, consort of the Sabine underground Goddess Feronia, \n"Mother of Wolves." A certain Roman family claimed descent from \nher Sabine priestesses, and annually demonstrated her power by \nwalking barefoot over glowing coals during the festival of the Feronia. 6 \nShe was also identified with Lupa the She- Wolf, whose spirit purified \nPalatine towns through the agency of young men in wolfskins, \nconsecrated by participating in the Lupercalia or Festival of the She- \nWolf. 7 \n\nThe She- Wolf was another aspect of the Triple Goddess, as \n\n\n\n1068 \n\n\n\nshown by her triadic motherhood. She gave three souls to her son, Werewolf \n\nthe legendary King Erulus or Herulus, so that when he was overthrown \n\nby Evander, he had to be killed three times. 8 The Amazons, who ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nworshipped the Triple Goddess, incorporated a tribe called the Neuri, \n\nwho "turned themselves into wolves" for a few days each year during \n\ntheir main religious festival, presumably by wearing wolf skins and \n\nmasks. 9 The same story was told of a certain Irish tribe in Ossory, \n\nwho became wolf-people when attending their Yuletide feast, devouring \n\nthe flesh of cattle as wolves, and afterward regaining their human \n\nshape. "Giraldus Cambrensis relates this great wonder in detail, as in \n\noperation in his own time, and believed every word of it." 10 \n\nThe heathens\' devotion to ancestral wolf gods in Teutonic Europe \nis evinced by the popularity of such names as Wolf, Wulf, Wolfram, \nWolfburg, Aethelwulf, Wolfstein, etc. "Beowulf son of Beowulf," hero \nof the Anglo-Saxon epic, was called Scyld by the Danes, who said he \ncame from the waters in a basket like Romulus and Remus, foster-sons \nof the She- Wolf. 11 \n\nIrish tribes said their spiritual fathers were wolves, and for that \nreason they wore wolf skins and used wolves\' teeth for healing \namulets. Celtic folksongs tell of children or wives transformed into \nwolves. One whole tribe was said to assume wolf shape very seventh \nyear. 12 As Germanic "berserkers" could become bears by donning \nbearskins, so it was thought people could become wolves by donning \nwolf pelts. 1? \n\nIn Mercia during the 10th century a.d. there was a revival of \npagan learning under two druidic priests, one of whom was named \nWerwulf. 14 This name of "spirit-wolf " seems to have been applied to \nopponents of Christianity in general. About 1000 a.d., the word \n"werewolf" was taken to mean an outlaw. 15 \n\nSouth Slavs used to pass a newborn child through a wolfskin, \nsaying it was thus born of the She- Wolf. After their conversion to \nChristianity, the people claimed this ceremony would protect the child \nfrom witches. But its real purpose, obviously, was to assimilate the \nchild to the wolf totem via a second birth from the wolf. 16 \n\nLivonians said witches routinely transformed themselves into \nwolves by passing through a certain magic pool, another instance of \nbaptismal rebirth in animal form. 17 Polish legend said a witch could \ntransform a bride and groom into wolves by laying a girdle of human \nskin across the threshold at their wedding feast. Later they would \nreceive dresses of fur and would regain their human shape at will. 18 \nAgainst such totemic ceremonies the 7th-century Council of Toledo \nissued severe denunciations of people who put on the heads of beasts, \nor "make themselves into wild animals." 19 \n\nItalian peasants still say a man who sleeps outdoors on Friday \nunder a full moon will be attacked by a werewolf, or will become one \nhimself. Friday was the night of the Goddess, and the warning against \nher lunar influence probably dated back to the myth of Endymion \n\n\n\n1069 \n\n\n\nWerewolf \n\n\n\nThe werewolf was \nknown to every Indo- \nEuropean language: \nDanish var-ulf, Gothic \nvaira-ulf, Old Nor- \nman wargus, Servian \nwlkoslak, Slovakian \nvlkodhk, Russian waw- \nkalak, Greek \nvrykolaki, Romanian \nvarcolaci, French \nloup-garou, Italian lupo \nmanaro, German \nWahr-Wdlffe." Shvk \nterms descended \nfrom volkhvi, a title of \nthe shamans who \nheld important positions \nin tribal life before \nChristianity. Cognates \nare German Volk, \n"people," and Russian \nvrach, "physician" \nindicating that were- \nwolves were people: \ntotemic healers in wolf \nmasks. 24 Similar \n"medicine men" are \nstill found among all \nprimitives. \n\n\n\n("Seduced Moon-Man"), who fell asleep on her holy moon-mountain \nand became her enchanted bridegroom, never to wake up again, so \nthe Goddess could shower her kisses on him each night. 20 \n\nAnother story traceable to wolf-clan traditions was "Little Red \nRiding Hood." The giveaway details are the red garment, the \noffering of food to a "grandmother" in the deep woods a grandmother \nwho wore a wolfskin and the cannibalistic motif of devouring and \nresurrection. In Britain, "a red woven hood" was the distinguishing \nmark of a prophetess or priestess. 21 The story\'s original victim would \nhave been not the red-clad Virgin but the hunter, as Lord of the Hunt. \nLike Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood was part of a Virgin- \nMother-Crone trinity, wearing the same red garment that Virgin Kali \nwore; as the red moon of a lunar eclipse she prophesied catastrophe \nand inspired much fear. Romanian churchmen declared that the \neclipsed moon was reddened by her own blood, shed when her \nwolves attacked her, to "make men repent and turn from evil." 22 \n\nThe Gaulish Diana had numerous wolf-cultists among her vota- \nries, in both ancient and medieval times. Under her totemic name of \nLupa she was a Mother of wild animals, and certain women seem to \nhave impersonated her in southern France. A Provencal troubadour \nnamed Pierre Vidal wrote a love poem to a lady of Carcassonne, whose \nname was Loba, "She- Wolf ": \n\nWhen loup-garou the rabble call me, \nWhen vagrant shepherds hoot, \nPursue, and buffet me to boot, \nIt doth not for a moment gall me, \nI seek not palaces nor halls, \nOr refuge when the winter falls; \nExposed to winds and frosts at night, \nMy soul is ravaged with delight. \nMe claims my she-wolf so divine; \nAnd justly she that claim prefers, \nFor, by my troth, my life is hers \nMore than another\'s, more than mine. 25 \n\nLovers of the She- Wolf sometimes found her on a holy moun- \ntain, which the gypsies called Monte Lupo, Wolf-Mountain. Young \nmen could learn the secrets of magic by celebrating the sacred \nmarriage: masturbating over the Goddess\'s statue and ejecting semen on \nit. She would guide and protect them, provided they never again set \nfoot in a Christian church. 26 Her votaries\' shape-shifting followed the \nphases of the moon, which was another form of the Goddess herself. \nIn the 12th century, Gervais of Tilbury noted: "In England we often \nsee men changed into wolves at the changes of the moon." 27 \n\nSacharow quoted an old Russian charm, to be spoken by one who \nwished to invoke the Moon-goddess and become a werewolf: \n\nOn the sea, on the ocean, on the island, on Bujan, on the empty pasture \ngleams the moon, on an ashstock lying in a green wood, in a gloomy \n\n\n\n1070 \n\n\n\nvale. Toward the stock wandereth a shaggy wolf, horned cattle seeking for Werewolf \n\nhis sharp white fangs; but the wolf enters not the forest, but the wolf \n\ndives not into the shadowy vale. Moon, moon, gold-horned moon, check ^^_^^^_^^^^^ \n\nthe flight of bullets, blunt the hunters\' knives, break the shepherds\' \n\ncudgels, cast wild fear upon all cattle, on men, on all creeping things, that \n\nthey may not catch the gray wolf, that they may not rend his warm \n\nskin! My word is binding, more binding than sleep, more binding than the \n\npromise of a hero. 28 \n\nThis charm has a ring of peasant magic, suggesting a hungry \npoacher hoping to steal some fresh meat from the baron\'s herds, under \nthe protection of a wolfskin. Poaching the overlord\'s cattle or game \nwas punishable by death, which may account for the cruelty meted out \nto those accused of lycanthropy. One captured "werewolf" in France \nwas so mauled that, a witness said, "he bore hardly any resemblance to a \nman, and struck with horror those who looked at him." The inquisi- \ntor, Pierre Boguet, explained that terrible injuries were common among \nwerewolves, due to the many lacerations they suffered while running \nthrough bramble bushes. 29 \n\nAnother werewolf captured by the Inquisition in 1 598 was "pos- \nsessed by a demon" while in prison, which gave him such a thirst that \nhe drank a large tubful of water, so his belly was "distended and hard." \nHe refused to eat or drink any more, and soon died. 30 Translating this \nofficial report into its probable reality, one would assume the unlucky \nwerewolf was subjected to the water torture and died of a ruptured \nstomach. \n\nAnother unfortunate werewolf was Peter Stubb of Cologne, tor- \ntured until he confessed having transformed himself into a wolf by a \nmagic girdle given him by the devil. The judges couldn\'t find the girdle \nwhere Stubb said he hid it, but they explained this by saying it had \n"gone to the Devil whence it came, so that it was not to be found." \nThough his case was unproved, Stubb was nastily executed for the \ncrime of lycanthropy: he was sentenced to have the flesh pulled off his \nbones in ten places with red-hot pincers, then to have his legs and \narms broken with a wooden axe; finally to be beheaded and burned. 31 \n\nYet another werewolf in 1 541 never even lasted long enough to go \nto prison. His captors hacked off his arms and legs, claiming to be \nsearching for the wolf-hair that he wore on the inside of his skin. The \nhair was not found, so the victim was declared innocent of lycan- \nthropy which did him little good, as he was already dead. 32 \n\nAn often-repeated story concerned a lone man attacked at night by \na lone wolf, which he wounded, usually by cutting off a forepaw. \nNext day a woman would be found with her hand missing, which \nidentified her as the werewolf. Such an incident was reported as fact \nby Jean de Nynauld in 161 5; the woman in the case was burned alive. 33 \nThe story probably recommended itself to some men as a perfect way \nto dispose of a woman they had mistreated, such as a rape victim. \n\nOn December 14, 1 598, a tailor of Chalons was sentenced to \n\n\n\n1071 \n\n\n\nWheel \n\n\n\ndeath for lycanthropy, having confessed to luring children into his \nshop, murdering and eating them. Methods by which these confessions \nwere extracted from the man can only be guessed, because the judges \nordered the court records burned. In 1 521 at Poligny, three men were \ninduced by torture to say they had made themselves wolves with a \nmagic salve given them by the devil, and in wolf shape they had eaten \nseveral children, and enjoyed sexual relations with wild she-wolves. 34 \nGilles Gamier was a famous "lycanthrope" caught by the Inquisition, \ntortured and executed for having devoured children. The charge was \nnot murder or cannibalism, but lycanthropy. 35 Whatever was left of the \npagan wolf cults, it seems the Christian church molded the material \ninto the enduring legend of the werewolf. \n\n1.

Tantric \ntradition showed the wheel as a mandala centering on the three \ntotems of the Triple Goddess, the dove (Virgin-Creatress), serpent \n(Mother-Preserver), and sow (Crone-Destroyer). 1 This mandala es- \ntablished "the six realms of the round of being," the sacred Hexagram. \n\nCelts worshipped the karmic star-wheel as the emblem of Mother \nArianrhod, ancestress of "Aryans." Some said it was a great silver \nwheel that dipped into the sea, on which heroes rode to Emania, the \nMoon\'s land of death. 2 \n\nIn Ethiopia the Goddess\'s image was placed in the center of a \nwheel of flames, like Indian images of Kali. Christian myths depict \nthe early missionaries\' destruction of her idol, which was called an old \nwoman with the power of the evil eye and with feet "like unto a \nwheel of fire." Jesus commanded: "Take this woman of the evil eye, \nand make up a fire, and carry her thereto, and throw her into it and \nburn her." 3 Her ashes were to be scattered to the wind, for people \nbelieved she might be resurrected from them, like the Phoenix, if \nthey remained in one place. \n\nDestruction of the Wheel-goddess\'s image was the probable basis \nfor the legend of St. Catherine, supposedly martyred on a wheel of \nfire, the famous "Catherine Wheel." There was no real St. Catherine, \n\n\n\n1072 \n\n\n\n\nbut there was a Goddess as Dancer of the Fiery Wheel, performing Wheel \n\nKathakali Kali\'s "dance of time" at the hub of the universe. The \n\nKalacakra Tantra (Wheel of Time), which presents this image, is still ^^^^^^^^ \n\nthe most revered text in India and Tibet, "coming at the head of the \n\ntannic section of the sacred canon." 4 See Catherine. \n\nCatherine was not the only medieval manifestation of the Goddess \nof the Wheel of Time, which was also the Wheel of Fortune \nmanipulated by the trinitarian Mother of Fate, Fortuna. In ancient \nRome she was one of the emanations of Juno Februata, whose \nfestival was Christianized as St. Valentine\'s Day. Its symbol was a wheel \nof six spokes formed of yonic mandorlas, in the Asiatic manner. 5 The \nsix spokes remained a sign of Juno well into the Christian era. 6 \n\nIn the 1 2th century, the Goddess and her wheel appeared in the \nHortus deliciarum (Garden of Delights). Wheel windows of cathe- \ndrals were connected with her, some showing human figures rising on \none side of the wheel and falling on the other, like the Rota Fortuna \nat the center of the Tarot\'s Major Trumps. "In these cathedral churches \nand royal abbeys is Dame Fortune who turns topsy-turvy faster than a \nwindmill." Honorius of Autun said, "Philosophers tell us of a woman Wheel of Fortune \n\nfastened to a wheel which turns perpetually, so that they say she is \nsometimes rising and sometimes falling with its movement. . . . The \nwoman fastened to the wheel is Fortune, whose head alternately rises \nand falls." Here was the real St. Catherine: the Fate-goddess, wor- \nshipped by builders who incorporated their own secret symbols into \nthe churches they built. Hugo pointed out that "Sometimes a porch, a \nfacade, or a whole church presents a symbolic meaning entirely \nforeign to worship, even inimical to the Church." 7 \n\nBoethius, a Gnostic philosopher whose writings were too popular \nto be ignored, was claimed as a Christian theologian; but his major \nwork made no mention of Christ. He found his Consolation of \nPhilosophy in the visitation of his guardian Goddesses, Philosophia \nand Fortuna. The latter taught him her doctrine of the karmic wheel: "I \ncause a rapid wheel to turn; I love to raise the fallen and abase the \nproud. Mount, then, if thou wilt, but on condition that thou dost not \nwax indignant when the law that presides at my Games demands that \nthou shalt descend." 8 \n\nFortuna, Goddess of the Wheel, may have been derived from a \npre-Roman Vortumna, "She Who Turns the Year." 9 Fate and \nTime were always linked in the thought of the ancients. Later Roman \nwriters tried to masculinize this Goddess as a seasonal god, Vertum- \nnus; but they gave away "his" original character by saying he appeared \nin the guise of an old woman. The Goddess was worshipped in both \nbeneficent and maleficent aspects as Bona Fortuna or Mala Fortuna, \nrepresented in her temple on the Esquiline as an All-Seeing Eye in \nthe form of a wheel. 10 \n\nAs Fortuna Primigeneia, the Goddess of the Wheel was called the \nfirstborn of the primal Mother Juno, and revered as the Virgin "who \n\n\n\n1073 \n\n\n\nWheel \n\n\n\nbestows on her worshippers every grace of body and every beauty of \nsoul." n She was identified with the Mazdean "Glory." From her, as \nthe Fortuna Augusti, Caesars drew their divine right to rule. \n\nHer fiery wheel was associated with kingship in a more primitive, \ndirect way during the early Bronze Age, when sacred kings died \nwithin the wheel of rebirth, as shown by the legend of Ixion, a ruler of \nthe Thessalian Lapiths. 12 Ixion was killed at the end of his term of \noffice, when he was rolled downhill, fastened inside a fiery wheel that \nsignified the sun. This sacred-king figure might be compared with the \nNorse deity Kris Kringle, a "Christ of the Wheel," personifying the \ndying and reborn sun of the winter solstice hence his later connec- \ntion with Christmas, even identification with Santa Claus. 13 \n\nNorthern Europeans believed the mystic wheels of existence \nstopped turning at the crucial transition from one year to the next, \nduring the darkest days of winter, when the sun came to its nadir. At this \ntime, during the season of Yule, all rotating motions were taboo. Cart \nwheels were not allowed to roll; butter could not be churned. 14 Yet at \nthe winter solstice and its corresponding point at the other side of the \nrolling year, Midsummer Eve, fiery fate-wheels were set rolling from \nBritish hilltops as late as the 19th century. "The Pagan rites of this \nfestival at the summer solstice, may be considered as a counterpart of \nthose used at the winter solstice at Yule-tide. . . . [T]he people imag- \nine that all their ill-luck rolls away from them together with this \nwheel." 15 \n\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a 6th-century Christian mystic \nwho pretended to be a lst-century bishop of Athens and was believed \nauthentic for many centuries, declared that the class of angels called \nThrones were really Wheels, having the name of Gel, "which in the \nHebrew tongue signifies revolutions and revelations." 16 This image was \nOriental, drawn from the vision of eastern temples as gigantic world- \nchariots, complete with wheels, in which the god was enthroned. In his \nchariot the god participated in the Carnival of Existence, carrying the \nworld along with all its teeming life forms: animals, plants, mountains, \nrivers. Upon identification with the god, the sages said, "He who has \nseen his true self looks down upon transmigrating existence as upon a \nrolling chariot-wheel." 17 \n\nMedieval processions sometimes took a circular form and went \nround and round a public square or courtyard, this exhibition being \nknown as a carrousel, "a wheel of chariots." 18 The inclusion of its \nmodel in the proceedings of carnivals and fairs bears out the probabil- \nity of its pagan origin, for most of the traditional trappings of fairs were \nleft over from the Old Religion, including the wheel of Fortune. \n\nThe very name of the Carnival came from old festivals of the \nGoddess Carna, mother of "re-in-Carnations," the same cycles \ncontrolled by Kali\'s wheel of karma. The roulette or "little wheel" \nevolved from the eastern prayer wheel. Its spirit was not only Dame \nFortune, but also Lady Luck, from Sanskrit Loka, a Divine Midwife \n\n\n\n1074 \n\n\n\nguarding one of the planetary spheres or "ascending light planes of Whisper \n\nexperience." 19 Whistling \n\nAnother carnival manifestation of the wheel was the Ferris Wheel, ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\na form of the Fairies\' Wheel, descended from the Celtic Wheel of \n\nArianrhod. Riders of the Wheel represented pre-Christian "fairy folk" \n\nwhose souls were involved in karmic cycles. The Dream of King \n\nArthur describes a Fairies\' Wheel closely resembling the modern Ferris \n\nWheel. 20 \n\n1. Campbell, CM., 416. 2. Spence, 152-53. 3. Gifford, 57. 4. Tatz & Kent, 1 8. \n5.

Butler, 147. \n\n\n\nWhisper \n\nThe ancients believed that ghosts and spirits would speak in whispers. \nHaving been deprived of flesh, the dead spoke without laryngeal sound. \nNearly all supernatural beings were supposed to be identifiable by \ntheir whisper-voices, even God, according to 1 Kings 19:12 the "still \nsmall voice" of God speaking to Elijah was a mistranslation of a phase \nmeaning literally "a thin whisper." l \n\nOther biblical parallels are Job 4:16, the same word "whisper" \ntranslated as a still voice; and Isaiah 29:4: "Thy voice shall be as one \nthat hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall \nwhisper out of the dust." These passages indicate the practice of \nancient "spirit mediums" when purporting to be in communication \nwith the dead. Impersonating the spirit, they whispered, so the voice \ncouldn\'t be identified. \n\nIn a medieval German legend, the Triple Goddess presided over a \nland of the dead called Wisperthal (Valley of Whispers) centering on \nan enchanted Hall of Mirrors perhaps related to the fairy-tale Crystal \nMountain. Three innocent youths once trespassed in the valley, met \nvarious aspects of the Goddess as three beautiful maidens, three terrible \nhags, and three black death-ravens. They barely escaped with their \nlives from the eerie place and vowed never to return. 2 \n\n1. Hoolce, S.P., 57. 2. Guerber, L.R., 219. \n\n\n\nWhistling \n\nAn old rhyme says "Whistling girls and crowing hens never come to \nany good ends." It was true; women who whistled were suspected of \nwitchcraft. Whistling was a piece of sympathetic magic used to raise a \nwind. Becalmed sailors were allowed to "whistle for the wind," but \nwhistling women were believed to cause destructive storms. 1 There- \nfore it became "unladylike" for girls to whistle. \n\nl.Robbins,361. \n\n\n\n1075 \n\n\n\nWiddershins \nWitch \n\n\n\nvar. Withershins \n\n\n\nWiddershins \n\nCounterclockwise, the direction of the moon, or "left-hand path" of \npagan dances (still prevalent in folk tradition). To open the door of a \nfairy hill, one must walk around it three times widdershins, as Childe \nRowland did, calling, "Open door!" The same Open Sesame appears in \nother ballads: "Thrice went fair Agnes the mountain round, and \nentered the cave beneath the ground." l As sacred caves once served as \npagan temples, the medieval church forbade their use and claimed \nthat walking or turning one\'s self widdershins was an indicium of \nwitchcraft. 2 See Left Hand. \n\n1. Wimberly, 363, 367. 2. Robbins, 209, 421 . \n\n\n\nWillow \n\nWater and willows represented the Goddess Helice, "Willow," virgin \nform of Hecate with her willow-withe grain-basket. 1 Willow wands \ninvoked the Muses, whose mountain was encircled by the Helicon, \n"Willow-stream." The Dionysian thyrsus, like the later witch\'s wand, \nwas willow. As Dionysus was once a major god of Jerusalem, the \nwillow figured prominently in municipal ceremonies there. A "Great \nDay" of the Feast of Tabernacles was known as the Day of Willows, \nwith rites honoring fire and water. 2 Willow wands gave protection in the \nunderworld, where Orpheus carried one to show the way. 3 Willow \nwands were sacred to the Moon-goddess as late as the 1 7th century a.d., \nwhen an English herbal said the moon owns the willow. \n\nWitches used willow bark to treat rheumatism and fevers; it was \nthe source of salicylic acid (aspirin), one of Hecate\'s cures. Some said \nwicca or "witchcraft" evolved from a word meaning willow, cognate \nwith "wicker" (willow-withe weaving). Magic cats were supposed to \ngrow from pussy-willows or "catkins," to become witches\' malkins \n(familiars): hence the saying that all cats were gray in the beginning. \nThe catkins were harbingers of spring, appearing on the willow as \ngraymalkins. (See Cat.) \n\n1. Graves, CM. 1,115. 2. Graves, W.G., 47. 3. Pepper & Wilcock, 57. \n\n\n\nWitch \n\nThere were many other words for witches, such as Incantatrix, \nLamia, Saga, Maga, Malefica, Sortilega, Strix, Venefica. 3 In Italy a \nwitch was a Strega or Janara, an old title of a priestess of Jana (Juno). 4 \nEnglish writers called witches both "hags" and "fairies," words which \nwere once synonymous. 5 Witches had metaphoric titles: bacularia, \n"stick-rider"; fascinatrix, "one with the evil eye"; herberia, "one who \ngathers herbs"; strix, "screech-owl"; pixidria, "keeper of an ointment- \n\n\n\n1076 \n\n\n\nbox"; femina saga, "wise- woman"; lamia, "night-monster"; incantator, \n"worker of charms"; magus, "wise-man"; sortiariae mulier, "seeress"; \nveneficia, "poisoner"; maliarda, "evil-doer." Latin treatises called witch- \nes anispex, auguris, divinator, januatica, ligator, mascara, phitonissa, \nstregula. 6 \n\nDalmatian witches were krstaca, "crossed ones," a derivative of the \nGreek Christos. 1 In Holland a witch was wijsseggher, "wise-sayer," \nfrom which came the English "wiseacre." 8 The biblical passage that \nsupported centuries of persecution, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to \nlive" (Exodus 22:18), used the Hebrew word kasaph, translated "witch" \nalthough it means a seer or diviner. 9 \n\nEarly medieval England had female clan-leaders who exercised \nmatriarchal rights in lawgiving and law enforcement; the Magna \nCarta of Chester called them iudices de wich judges who were \nwitches. 10 Female elders once had political power among the clans, \nbut patriarchal religion and law gradually took it away from them and \ncalled them witches in order to dispose of them. In 1711 Addison \nobserved that "When an old woman begins to doat and grow chargeable \nto a Parish, she is generally turned into a witch." u \n\nScot remarked that the fate of a witch might be directly proportion- \nal to her fortune. The pope made saints out of rich witches, but poor \nwitches were burned. 12 Among many examples tending to support this \nopinion was the famous French Chambre Ardente affair, which \ninvolved many members of the aristocracy and the upper-class clergy in \na witch cult. Numerous male and female servants were tortured and \nburned for assisting their masters in working witchcraft; but in all the \nfour years the affair dragged on, no noble person was tortured or \nexecuted. 13 \n\nIllogically enough, the authorities persecuted poor, outcast folk as \nwitches, yet professed to believe witches could provide themselves \nwith all the wealth anyone could want. Reginald Scot, a disbeliever, \nscornfully observed that witches were said to "transfer their neigh- \nbors\' corn into their own ground, and yet are perpetual beggars, and \ncannot enrich themselves, either with money or otherwise: who is so \nfoolish as to remain longer in doubt of their supernatural powers? " H \nWitchcraft brought so little profit to Helen Jenkenson of Northants, \nhanged in 1612 for bewitching a child, that the record of her execution \nsaid: "Thus ended this woman her miserable life, after she had lived \nmany years poor, wretched, scorned and forsaken of the world." 15 \n\nThe nursery-rhyme stereotype of the witch owed much to Scot\'s \ndescription: \n\nWomen which be commonly old, lame, blear-eyed, pale, foul, and full of \nwrinkles; poor, sullen, superstitious, and papists; or such as know no \nreligion; in whose drowsy minds the devil hath gotten a fine seat; so as, \nwhat mischief, mischance, calamity, or slaughter is brought to pass, \nthey are easily persuaded the same is done by themselves. . . . They are \n\n\n\nWitch \n\n\n\nSkeat\'s Etymological \nDictionary derived \n"witch" from medi- \neval English wicche, \nformerly Anglo-Sax- \non wicca, masculine, or \nwicce, feminine: a \ncorruption of witga, \nshort form of witega, \na seer or diviner; from \nAnglo-Saxon witan, \nto see, to know. Similar- \nly, Icelandic vitki, a \nwitch, came from vita, \nto know; or vizkr, \nclever or knowing one. \nWizard came from \nNorman French wis- \nchard, Old French \nguiscart, sagacious one. 1 \nThe surname Whit- \ntaker came from \nWitakarlege, a wiz- \nard or a witch. 2 The \nwords "wit" and \n"wisdom" came from \nthe same roots. \n\n\n\n1077 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHcti \n\n\n\nlean and deformed, showing melancholy in their faces, to the horror of \nall that see them. They are doting, scolds, mad, devilish; and not much \ndiffering from them that are thought to be possessed with spirits. \' 6 \n\nPersecutors said it was heretical to consider witches harmless. \nEven in England, where witches were not burned but hanged, some \nauthorities fearfully cited the "received opinion" that a witch\'s body \nshould be burned to ashes to prevent ill effects arising from her blood. 1 \' \nChurchmen assured the arresting officers that a witch\'s power was \nlost the instant she was touched by an employee of the Inquisition; but \nthe employees themselves were not so sure. 18 \n\nNumerous stories depict the persecutors\' fear of their victims. It \nwas said in the Black Forest that a witch blew in her executioner\'s \nface, promising him his reward; the next day he was afflicted with a fate \nleprosy. Inquisitors\' handbooks directed them to wear at all times a \nbag of salt consecrated on Palm Sunday; to avoid looking in a witch\'s \neyes; and to cross themselves constantly in the witches\' prison. Peter \nof Berne forgot this precaution, and a captive witch by enchantment \nmade him fall down a flight of stairs which he proved later by \ntorturing her until she confirmed it. 19 \n\nAny unusual ability in a woman instantly raised a charge of \nwitchcraft. The so-called Witch of Newbury was murdered by a \ngroup of soldiers because she knew how to go "surfing" on the river. \nSoldiers of the Earl of Essex saw her doing it, and were "as much \nastonished as they could be," seeing that "to and fro she fleeted on the \nboard standing firm bolt upright . . . turning and winding it which \nway she pleased, making it pastime to her, as little thinking who \nperceived her tricks, or that she did imagine that they were the last \nshe ever should show." Most of the soldiers were afraid to touch her, \nbut a few brave souls ambushed the board-rider as she came to shore, \nslashed her head, beat her, and shot her, leaving her "detested carcass fo \nthe worms." 20 \n\nFrom ruthlessly organized persecutions on the continent, witch- \nhunts in England became largely cases of village feuds and petty \nspite. If crops failed, horses ran away, cattle sickened, wagons broke, \nwomen miscarried, or butter wouldn\'t come in the churn, a witch \nwas always found to blame. Marion Cumlaquoy of Orkney was burned \nin 1643 for turning herself three times widdershins, to make her \nneighbor\'s barley crop rot. A tailor\'s wife was executed for quarrelling \nwith her neighbor, who afterward saw a snake on his property, and his \nchildren fell sick. One witch was condemned for arguing with a \ndrunkard in an alehouse. After drinking himself into paroxysms of \nvomiting, he accused her of bewitching him, and he was believed. 21 \n\nA woman was convicted of witchcraft for having caused a neigh- \nbor\'s lameness by pulling off her stockings. Another was executed \nfor having admired a neighbor\'s baby, which afterward fell out of its \ncradle and died. Two Glasgow witches were hanged for treating a \nsick child, even though the treatment succeeded and the child was \n\n\n\n1078 \n\n\n\ncured. Joan Cason of Kent went to the gallows in 1 586 for having dry \nthatch on her roof. Her neighbor, whose child was sick, was told by an \nunidentified traveler that the child was bewitched, and it could be \nproved by stealing a bit of thatch from the witch\'s roof and throwing it \non the fire. If it crackled and sparked, witchcraft was assured. The test \ncame out positive, and the court was satisfied enough to convict poor \nJoan. 22 \n\nWitches were convenient scapegoats for doctors who failed to cure \ntheir patients, for it was the "received" belief that witch-caused \nillnesses were incurable. Weyer said, "Ignorant and clumsy physicians \nblame all sicknesses which they are unable to cure or which they have \ntreated wrongly, on witchery." There were also priests and monks who \n"claim to understand the healing art and they lie to those who seek \nhelp that their sicknesses are derived from witchery." 23 Most real witch \npersecutions reflect "no erotic orgies, no Sabbats or elaborate rituals; \nmerely the hatreds and spites of narrow peasant life assisted by vicious \nlaws." 24 \n\nWitches provided a focus for sexist hatred in male-dominated \nsociety, as Stanton pointed out: \n\nThe spirit of the Church in its contempt for women, as shown in the \nScriptures, in Paul\'s epistles and the Pentateuch, the hatred of the \nfathers, manifested in their ecclesiastical canons, and in the doctrines of \nasceticism, celibacy, and witchcraft, destroyed man \'s respect for woman \nand legalized the burning, drowning, and torturing of women. . . . \n\nWomen and their duties became objects of hatred to the Christian \nmissionaries and of alternate scorn and fear to pious ascetics and \nmonks. The priestess mother became something impure, associated with \nthe devil, and her lore an infernal incantation, her very cooking a \nbrewing of poison, nay, her very existence a source of sin to man. Thus \nwoman, as mother and priestess, became woman as witch. . . . \n\nHere is the reason why in all the Biblical researches and higher \ncriticism, the scholars never touch the position of women. 25 \n\nMen displayed a lively interest in the physical appearance of \nwitches, seeking to know how to recognize them as men also craved \nrules for recognizing other types of women from their physical \nappearance. It was generally agreed that any woman with dissimilar eyes \nwas a witch. Where most people had dark eyes and swarthy complex- \nions, as in Spain and Italy, pale blue eyes were associated with \nwitchcraft. Many claimed any woman with red hair was a witch. 26 \n\nThis may have been because red-haired people are usually freck- \nled, and freckles were often identified as "witch marks," as were \nmoles, warts, birthmarks, pimples, pockmarks, cysts, liver spots, wens, or \nany other blemish. Some witch-finders said the mark could resemble \nan insect bite or an ulcer. 27 \n\nNo one ever explained how the witch mark differed from an \nordinary blemish. Since few bodies were unblemished, the search for \nthe mark seldom failed. Thomas Ady recognized this, and wrote: "Very \n\n\n\nWitch \n\n\n\nThomas Ady One \n\nof the few 17th-century \nEnglish debunkers of \nthe witchcraft craze; au- \nthor of A Perfect \nDiscovery of Witches \n(1661). \n\n\n\n1079 \n\n\n\nWitch \n\n\n\nDean R.W. \nChurch British clergy- \nman, author of St. \nAnselm (1870). \n\n\n\nfew people in the world are without privy marks upon their bodies, as \nmoles or stains, even such as witchmongers call the devil\'s privy \nmarks." 28 But no one paid attention to this. \n\nTrials were conducted with as much injustice as possible. In 1629 \nIsobel Young was accused of crippling by magic a man who had \nquarrelled with her, and causing a water mill to break down. She \nprotested that the man was lame before their quarrel, and water mills \ncan break down through neglect. The prosecutor, Sir Thomas Hope, \nthrew out her defense on the ground that it was "contrary to the \nlibel," that is, it contradicted the charge. 29 When a witch is on trial, Scot \nsaid, any "equivocal or doubtful answer is taken for a confession." 30 \n\nOn the other hand, no answer at all was a confession too. \nWitches who refused to speak were condemned: "Witchcraft proved by \nsilence of the accused." 31 Sometimes mere playfulness "proved" \nwitchcraft, as in the case of Mary Spencer, accused in 1634 because she \nmerrily set her bucket rolling downhill and ran before it, calling it to \nfollow her. 32 Sometimes women were stigmatized as witches when they \nwere in fact victims of unfair laws, such as the law that accepted any \nman\'s word in court ahead of any number of women\'s. A butcher in \nGermany stole some silver vessels from women, then had them \nprosecuted for witchcraft by claiming that he found the vessels in the \nwoods where the women were attending a witches\' sabbat. 33 \n\nSometimes the accusation of witchcraft was a form of punishment \nfor women who were too vocal about their disillusionment with men \nand their preference for living alone. Historical literature has many \nreferences to "the joy with which women after widowhood set up \ntheir own households, and to the vigor with which they resisted being \ncourted by amorous widowers." 34 The solitary life, however, left a \nwoman even more vulnerable to accusations of witchcraft, since men \nusually thought she must be somehow controlled. \n\nThose who tortured the unfortunate defendant into admitting \nwitchcraft used a euphemistic language that showed the victim was \ncondemned a priori. One Anne Marie de Georgel denied making a \ndevil\'s pact, until by torture she was "justly forced to give an account \nof herself," the record said. Catherine Delort was "forced to confess by \nthe means we have power to use to make people speak the truth," \nand she was "convicted of all the crimes we suspected her of commit- \nting, although she protested her innocence for a long time." The \ninquisitor Nicholas Remy professed a pious astonishment at the great \nnumber of witches who expressed a "positive desire for death," \npretending not to notice that they had been brought to this desire by \ninnumerable savage tortures. 35 See Torture. \n\nThe extent to which pagan religion, as such, actually survived \namong the witches of the 16th and 17th centuries has been much \ndiscussed but never decided. Dean Church said, "Society was a long \ntime unlearning heathenism; it has not done so yet; but it had hardly \nbegun, at any rate it was only just beginning, to imagine the possibility \n\n\n\n1080 \n\n\n\nof such a thing in the eleventh century." In 1 5th-century Bohemia it Witchcraft \n\nwas still common practice at Christmas and other holidays to make \n\nofferings to "the gods," rather than to God. 35 European villages still ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nhad many "wise-women" who acted as priestesses officially or unoffi- \ncially. Since church fathers declared Christian priestesses \nunthinkable, all functions of the priestess were associated with pagan- \nism. 37 Bishops described pagan gatherings in their dioceses, attended \nby "devils ... in the form of men and women." 38 Pagan ceremonies \nwere allowed to survive in weddings, folk festivals, seasonal rites, \nfeasts of the dead, and so on. 39 But when women or Goddesses played \nthe leading role in such ceremonies, there was more determined \nsuppression. John of Salisbury wrote that it was the devil, "with God\'s \npermission," who sent people to gatherings in honor of the Queen of \nthe Night, a priestess impersonating the Moon-goddess under the name \nof Noctiluca or Herodiade. 40 \n\nThe Catholic church applied the word "witch" to any woman who \ncriticized church policies. Women allied with the 14th-century \nReforming Franciscans, some of whom were burned for heresy, were \ndescribed as witches, daughters of Judas, and instigated of the Devil. 41 \nWriters of the Talmud similarly tended to view nearly all women as \nwitches. They said things like, "Women are naturally inclined to \nwitchcraft," and "The more women there are, the more witchcraft \nthere will be." 42 \n\nProbably there were few sincere practitioners, compared with the \n\nmultitudes who were railroaded into the ecclesiastical courts and \n\nlegally murdered despite their innocence. Yet it was obvious to even the \n\nmoderately intelligent that Christian society deliberately humiliated \n\nand discriminated against women. Some may have been resentful \n\nenough to become defiant. "Women have had no voice in the canon \n\nlaw, the catechisms, the church creeds and discipline, and why should \n\nthey obey the behests of a strictly masculine religion, that places the \n\nsex at a disadvantage in all life\'s emergencies?" 43 Possibilities for \n\nexpressing their frustration and defiance were severely limited; but \n\nvoluntary adoption of the witch\'s reputation and behavior was surely \n\namong such possibilities. \n\nl.Leland,66. 2.

Martin of Braga said women must be \n^^^^^^^^^ condemned for "decorating tables, wearing laurels, taking omens \n^^^^^^^"" from footsteps, putting fruit and wine on the log in the hearth, and \nbread in the well, what are these but worship of the devil? For \nwomen to call upon Minerva when they spin, and to observe the day of \nVenus at weddings and to call upon her whenever they go out upon \nthe public highway, what is that but worship of the devil?" l \n\nOutside the official religion, where they were kept, women passed \ndown their private family recipes and charms, curses and blessings, \ntelling traditional tales of the past and foretelling the future from omens \nand "signs." The Dominican Johann Herolt declared: "Most women \nbelie their catholic faith with charms and spells, after the fashion of Eve \ntheir first mother, who believed the devil speaking through the \nserpent rather than God himself. . . . [A]ny woman by herself knows \nmore of such superstitions and charms than a hundred men." 2 \n\nUp to the 1 5th century, women\'s "charms and spells" were \nvirtually the only repository of practical medicine. Churchmen avoid- \ned doctoring, on the ground that all sickness came from demonic \npossession, and the only permissible cure was exorcism. 3 \n\nEurope\'s traditional witch doctors were women: clan mothers, \npriestesses of healing shrines, midwives, nurses, vilas. In pre-Christian \nGaul and Scandinavia, medicine was entirely in the hands of women. 4 \nEven in the Christian era, the village wise-woman was still every \npeasant\'s family doctor. Paracelsus said witches taught him everything \nhe knew about healing. 5 Dr. Lambe, the Duke of Buckingham\'s \nfamous "devil," was said to have learned secrets of medicine by \nconsorting with witches. 6 \n\nIn 1 570 the gaoler of Canterbury Castle released a condemned \nwitch, citing the popular opinion that she did more good for the sick \nwith her homely remedies than all the priests\' prayers and exorcisms. 7 \nAgrippa von Nettesheim thought witches superior to male practitio- \nners: "Are not philosophers, mathematicians, and astrologers often \ninferior to country women in their divinations and predictions, and \ndoes not the old nurse very often beat the doctor?" 8 The men who \nlearned doctoring from witches were allowed to practice, but their \nfemale teachers were persecuted. Scot observed that a male "conjurer" \nwas permitted to cure disease by magic arts, whereas a woman was \ncondemned to death for doing so. 9 \n\nOrdinary folk had no doctors. Physicians were available chiefly to \nthe rich. The poor took their troubles to the local witch. Irish farmers \nstill say a "fairy doctor" is needed for charms against the evil eye. In \nGreece, "both priests and witches are available for emergencies \ncreated by the evil eye. The priest burns incense and recites appropriate \nprayers. The witch also burns incense as she recites appropriate \nincantations." 10 \n\nIt wasn\'t unusual for the witches\' healing charms to be preferred \n\n\n\n1082 \n\n\n\nto those of the church, or for the two to be regarded as identical in Witchcraft \n\nessence. Ramesey wrote that the witches\' cures were indistinguish- \nable from the "magical and juggling cures" professed by the clergy, ^^^^^^^^^^^ \nincluding "saints, images, relics, holy-waters, shrines, avemarys, cru- \ncifixes, benedictions, charms, characters, sigils of the planets, and of the \nsigns ... all such cures are rather to be ascribed to the forces of the \nimagination, than any virtue in them." n \n\nOfficially, women were often forbidden to do any kind of healing. \nIn 1322 a woman named Jacoba Felicie was arrested and prosecuted \nby the medical faculty of the University of Paris for practicing medicine, \nalthough, the record said, "she was wiser in the art of surgery and \nmedicine than the greatest master or doctor in Paris." 12 \n\nScot said witchmongers gave the witches as much power as Christ, \nand even more, when they claimed witches could raise the dead, as \nChrist raised Lazarus; they could turn water into other fluids, like wine \nor milk; they could control the weather, the crops, animals, men; they \ncould see into the past and future. Reading of witches\' trials, he said, \n"you shall see such impossibilities confessed, as none, having his right \nwits, will believe." n Loher also declared that the "sins" for which \nwitches were brought to the stake were such "that they could not \npossibly commit." 14 \n\nChurchmen, however, viewed the impossibility of witches\' mir- \nacles as perfectly good ground for believing them, "because the \nperformance of the impossible proved that demons were at work." 15 It \nwas never explained how the performance of a miracle demonstrated \nthe intervention of a saint in one case and of a demon in another. For \nexample, Marie Bucaille was burned as a witch, though her "mir- \nacles" were saintlike: she healed the sick, saw holy visions, displayed \nstigmata, and performed many of the acts that led to canonization in \nother cases. 16 \n\nThe same acts were differently interpreted by churchmen in \ndifferent times. Witchcraft was allowed through the first half of the \nChristian era. It was not called a "heresy" until the 14th century. In 500 \na.d. the Franks\' Salic Law recognized witches\' right to practice. In \n643, an edict declared it illegal to burn witches. 17 In 785, the Synod of \nPaderborn said anyone who burned a witch must be sentenced to \ndeath. 18 France\'s first trial to declare witchcraft a crime took place in \n1390. 19 \n\nUp to a surprisingly late date, nobility and clergy alike employed \nthe services of witches. In 1382 the Count of Kyburg hired a witch to \nstand on the battlements of his castle and raise a thunderstorm to \ndisperse an army of enemies. 20 This practice was soundly based on \ntheological opinion that witches could raise storms at will, "either upon \nsea or land." 21 Churchmen said witches controlled the weather "with \nGod\'s permission," and they didn\'t begin to punish what God permitted \nuntil the beginning of the Renaissance. 22 \n\nWitches were summoned to court by Louis d\'Orleans to cure his \n\n\n\n1083 \n\n\n\nWitchcraft \n\n\n\nbrother\'s madness, after priestly exorcisms had failed. (The witches \nalso failed.) Guichard, Bishop of Troyes, used the classic pierced-puppet \nkind of witchcraft to kill his enemy, Queen Blanche of Navarre. 23 \n\nEnglish law was fairly tolerant of witchcraft until the reign of \nJames I. As late as 1371 a male witch was arrested in Southwark for \npossessing magical articles: a skull, a grimoire, and a corpse\'s head for \ndivination. He was released after he had promised not to do it again. 24 \nIn 1 560, a lenient period, eight men confessed to conjuration and \nsorcery, and were released with a reprimand. Only three years later the \nsame acts were made punishable by imprisonment or a death penalty. 25 \n\nThe Council of Treves in 1 3 10 outlawed conjurations, divina- \ntions, and love potions. 26 Further prohibitions seemed to be aimed at \nsupporting husbands who wished to cast off their wives. Stringent laws \nthreatened a witch to whom an abandoned wife might apply, for \nrevenge through malefica, since she had no recourse under law. 27 \n\nThe church distinguished between sorcery, which was generally \nacceptable, and witchcraft, which was heresy. Von Nettesheim\'s books \nof sorcery were published under church auspices, accompanied by a \nstatement of ecclesiastical approval; indeed, his instructor in magic had \nbeen John Trithemius, an abbot. What the distinction between sorcery \nand witchcraft boiled down to was that men could practice magic, \nwomen could not. 28 \n\nWhen the church discovered that common folk couldn\'t under- \nstand the doctrinal subtleties of heresy and didn\'t care about theological \narguments, persecution was extended into areas that were accessible to \nthe public mind, so the church could maintain its control of that mind. \nFor example, in the region of Bonn a late spring frost of 1610 ruined \ncrops and was officially described as an act of God. Twenty years later, \nafter the witch judges came to the area, the same kind of natural \ndisasters were blamed exclusively on witches. 29 \n\nChurchmen fostered the public delusion that witches were en- \ngaged in a vast secret plot, under the devil\'s guidance, to overthrow the \nkingdom of God on earth. They created and embellished the concept of \nthe black mass, and made laymen believe it frequently occurred, \nwhereas it was largely a fraud supported only by spurious "evidence" \nfrom the torture chamber. The Inquisition needed this public delusion, \nbecause the work it was created for was finished when the Albigensian, \nWaldensian, and other heretic groups of the south of France had been \nfinally crushed. In order to continue its profitable existence, the Inquisi- \ntion needed new victims. The witchcraft mania was the solution to its \nproblem. 50 Whatever secular crimes the witches were supposed to have \ncommitted, the one crime that was decisive in sending all of them to the \nstake was the one crime of which all of them were completely innocent, \nbecause it was impossible: the crime of collaborating with a real devil. \nAs for secret continuation of a pre-Christian religion: that was more \noften done by the church itself, in the guise of saint-worship, festivals, \nhealing shrines, etc. \n\n\n\n1084 \n\n\n\nScholars aren\'t sure how much pagan religion survived in the form \nof actual group worship, at the beginning of the era of persecution. Pico \ndella Mirandola\'s La Strega (The Witch) described a cult in northern \nItaly where a pagan Goddess presided over sexual orgies; she was said to \nbear a close resemblance to the Mother of God. 31 Another group at \nArras was said to have centered on "a prostitute" called Demiselle, or \nThe Maiden. Her consort was the Abbot of Little Sense, otherwise \nknown as the Prince of Fools, a composer and singer of popular \nsongs in other words, it was a cult of minstrelsy. 52 (See Romance.) \n\nThere is a vast body of "information" about what went on at the \nwitches\' Sabbat all of it worthless, because its source was the torture \nchamber. The late Renaissance saw a frivolous interest in "black \nmasses" among the wealthy, who tried to model a new cult group on \nwhat they had read of earlier trials. In 1610, Pierre de l\'Ancre wrote of \n"great Lords and Ladies and other rich and powerful ones who handle \nthe great matters of the Sabbath, where they appear cloaked, and the \nwomen with masks, that they may keep themselves always hidden and \nunknown." 33 In the reign of Louis XIV, half the Parisian clergy and \nmost of the court, including Madame de Montespan, were involved \nwith a society witch called La Voisin, who staged black masses for \nthem. 34 But their rituals were based on ecclesiastical literature, not on a \ntrue folk tradition. \n\nIt has been claimed that witchcraft constituted a coherent under- \nground organization from the beginning, with well-defined chains of \ncommand and communication. "Witch books" purporting to come \nfrom the ancient tradition speak of a Brotherhood (not Sisterhood): "If \nyou are condemned, fear not, the Brotherhood is powerful, they will \nhelp you to escape if you stand steadfast. ... Be sure, if steadfast you go \nto the pyre, drugs will reach you, you will feel naught. You but go to \ndeath and what lies beyond, the Ecstasy of the Goddess." 35 But during \nthe real persecutions, few witches seemed indifferent to their sufferings, \nand virtually none escaped. \n\nMonstrelet described a typical early example of persecution in \n1459. \n\nIn this year, in the town of Arras and county of Artois, arose, through a \nterrible and melancholy chance, an opinion called, I know not why, the \nReligion of Vaudoisie. This sect consisted, it is said, of certain persons, \nboth men and women, who, under cloud of night, by the power of the \ndevil, repaired to some solitary spot, amid woods and deserts, where the \ndevil appeared before them in a human form save that his visage is \nnever perfectly visible to them read to the assembly a book of his \nordinances, informing them how he could be obeyed; distributed a very \nlittle money and a plentiful meal, which was concluded by a scene of \ngeneral profligacy; after which each one of the party was conveyed home \nto her or his own habitation. \n\nOn accusations of access to such acts of madness, several creditable \npersons of the town of Arras were seized and imprisoned along with some \nfoolish women and persons of little consequence. These were so horribly \n\n\n\nWitchcraft \n\n\n\nFrancoise Athenais \nde Rochechouart, \n\nMarquise de Mon- \ntespan (1641-1707). \nMistress of Louis \nXIV for 1 3 years, moth- \ner of seven of his \nchildren; court patron- \ness of Corneille, \nRacine, and La \nFontaine. \n\n\n\n1085 \n\n\n\nWitchcraft \n\n\n\ntortured that some of them admitted the truth of the whole accusations, \nand said, besides, that they had seen and recognized in their nocturnal \nassembly many persons of rank, prelates, seigneurs, and governors of \nbailliages and cities, being such names as the examiners had suggested to \nthe persons examined, while they constrained them by torture to impeach \nthe persons to whom they belonged. Several of those who had been thus \ninformed against were arrested, thrown into prison, and tortured for so \nlong a time that they also were obliged to confess what was charged \nagainst them. After this those of mean condition were executed and \ninhumanly burnt, while the richer and more powerful of the accused \nransomed themselves by sums of money, to avoid the punishment and the \nshame attending it. Many even of those also confessed being persuaded to \ntake that course by the interrogators, who promised them indemnity for \nlife and fortune. Some there were, of a truth, who suffered with marvel- \nlous patience and constancy the torments inflicted on them, and would \nconfess nothing imputed to their charge; but they, too, had to give large \nsums to the judges, who exacted that such of them as, notwithstanding \ntheir mishandling, were still able to move, should banish themselves from \nthat part of the country. . . . fl]t ought not to be concealed that the whole \naccusation was a strategem of wicked men for their own covetous \npurposes, and in order, by these false accusations and forced confessions, \nto destroy the life, fame, and fortune of wealthy persons. * 6 \n\nThose prisoners who found themselves condemned to death \nimmediately shrieked aloud that they had been tricked; they were \npromised a light sentence, such as a pilgrimage, if they confessed as \nthe inquisitors wanted. 57 \n\nWitchcraft persecutions picked up momentum when inquisitors \nwere seeking new victims to keep their organization going. In 1375 a \nFrench inquisitor lamented that all the rich heretics had been extermi- \nnated; there were none left whose wealth could support the \nInquisition, and "it is a pity that so salutary an institution as ours should \nbe so uncertain of its future." Then Pope John XXII empowered the \nInquisition to prosecute anyone who worked magic, and "the Inquisi- \ntion slowly and unevenly developed its concept of witchcraft." w \nSoon the church was making sweeping claims, such as the claim that the \nentire population of Navarre consisted of witches. 59 \n\nWitch hunting sustained itself because it became a major industry, \nsupporting the income of many. Local nobles, bishops, kings, judges, \ncourts, townships, magistrates, and other functionaries high and low all \nreceived a share of the loot collected by inquisitors from their victims\' \nassets. Victims were charged for the very ropes that bound them and the \nwood that burned them. Each procedure of torture carried its fee. \nAfter the execution of a wealthy witch, officials usually treated them- \nselves to a banquet at the expense of the victim\'s estate. 40 \n\nInquisitors were no less zealous in wringing the last penny out of \ntheir poorer victims than in helping themselves to the estates of the \nrich. In 1256, a woman named Raymonde Barbaira died before her \nsentence could be carried out, leaving to her heirs a chest of linens, \n\n\n\n1086 \n\n\n\nher clothes, several cows, and four sous in cash. The inquisitor demand- Witchcraft \n\ned from the heirs forty sous for all the property. "Such petty and \n\nvulgar details," Lea said, "give us a clearer insight into the spirit and ^ ^^ m mmmmm \n\nworking of the Inquisition, and of the grinding oppression which it \n\nexercised on the subject populations." 41 \n\nA history of the Inquisition written by a Catholic in 1909 had to \nadmit that it "invented the crime of witchcraft and . . . relied on torture \nas the means of proving it." At first the Inquisition encountered \nskepticism everywhere. Even theologians shocked the inquisitors by \nattributing natural disasters to chance, or God, rather than to witch- \ncraft. The public disbelieved witches\' confessions, saying they were \nextracted only by torture. Peasants in some subalpine valleys broke \ninto open rebellion against the judges\' wholesale burnings. It took \ndecades of ceaseless propagandizing, and ruthless measures to stop \nthe mouths of critics, before the persecution could be said to have won \npublic support. 42 \n\nSevere persecution dated from the bull of Pope Innocent VIII, \nSummis desiderantes, wherein God\'s vicar "infallibly" declared that \nwitches could blast crops and domestic animals, cause disease, prevent \nhusbands and wives from copulating, and in general "outrage the \nDivine Majesty and are a cause of scandal and danger to very many." 43 \nThe Divine Majesty being apparently unable to look after its own \ninterests without human help, the churchmen took it upon themselves \nto carry out God\'s vengeance, which developed into a "hideous \nnightmare" as the church\'s mailed fist stretched over the western world \nfor five centuries. 44 \n\nThe earlier Canon Episcopi ruled that witchcraft was nothing but \na delusion, and it was heresy to believe in it. But that was before the \nchurch discovered how to profit from the witchcraft belief. After Pope \nInnocent\'s reign, it was heresy not to believe in witchcraft. According \nto Martin Del Rio, S.J., anyone who thought witchcraft was only a \ndeception must be suspected of being a witch. No one was allowed to \nspeak against the extermination of witches. Inquisitor Heinrich von \nSchultheis said, "He who opposes the extermination of the witches \nwith one single word can not expect to remain unscathed." 45 \n\nSuperstitious belief in the "evil" of witchcraft persisted to a very \nlate date. The last English witch trial took place in 1712. The last \nofficial witch burning in Scotland was in 1727, with unofficial incidents \neven later. Only a century ago, an elderly woman in the Russian \nvillage of Wratschewe was locked in her cottage and set afire for \nbewitching cattle. Her murderers were tried, and sentenced only to a \nlight ecclesiastical penance. 46 In January, 1928, a family of Hungarian \npeasants beat an old woman to death, claiming she was a witch. A \ncourt acquitted them, on the ground that they acted out of "irresistible \ncompulsion." 47 \n\nThe real reason for persistence of the witchcraft idea was that \nChristian authorities couldn\'t let it die, without admitting that God\'s \n\n\n\n1087 \n\n\n\nWitchcraft \n\n\n\nword was wrong, and God\'s servants had committed millions of legal \nmurders and tortured millions of helpless people without cause. Dr. \nBlackstone, England\'s ultimate authority on jurisprudence, wrote: "To \ndeny the possibility, nay, actual existence of Witchcraft and Sorcery, \nis at once flatly to contradict the revealed Word of God in various \npassages both of the Old and New Testament; and the thing itself is a \ntruth to which every Nation in the World hath in its turn borne \ntestimony." When skepticism about witchcraft seemed to be on the \nrise, John Wesley cried bitterly, "The giving up of witchcraft is in effect \nthe giving up of the Bible." 48 Calvin and Knox also protested that \ndenial of witchcraft meant denial of the Bible\'s authority. 49 Joseph \nGlanvill, chaplain to Charles II, said all who disbelieved in witchcraft \nwere atheists. 50 \n\nDespite such protests, skepticism grew with the slow advance of \nthe Age of Enlightenment. In 1736, Scottish laws against the \n"crime" of witchcraft were formally repealed. Yet the church refused to \nkeep pace with the law. Forty years later, ministers of the Associated \nPresbytery passed a resolution declaring their unabated belief in witch- \ncraft. 51 As late as the 1920s a rector of four parishes in Norfolk could \nstill write: "If I were to take a census of opinion in all four villages I am \ncertain that I should find a majority of people seriously professing \nbelief in witchcraft, the policy of the \'evil eye,\' and the efficacy of both \ngood and evil spells." 52 The churches wouldn\'t let these beliefs die. \n\nChristianity, then, has been chiefly responsible for the survival and \ngrowth of witchcraft as an article of faith. It seems so still. In the \n1940s, Seabrook estimated that "half the literate white population in the \nworld today believe in witchcraft"; and the nonliterate nonwhite \npopulation attains a much higher proportion. 53 A Gallup poll taken in \n1978 showed that ten percent of all Americans believe in witches. 54 \n\nBut what is meant by "believe in"? It could mean a belief that \nthere are people who call themselves witches; this is self-evident \nenough. It could mean a belief that such people erroneously think they \nhave supernatural powers. It could mean a belief that such people \nreally do have supernatural powers. It could mean a belief that, as the \nchurch has always maintained, witches are agents of the devil, seeking \nto destroy the world out of sheer perversity. Or, it could mean a belief \nthat witches preserved an older and better religion based on worship \nof Nature and the female principle. \n\nThose who now call themselves witches usually uphold some \nversion of the latter belief. A modern witch, Leo Louis Martello, \nsays: \n\nWe worship and identify with the Horned God, Lord of the Hunt and the \nUnderworld, and the Mother Goddess, especially the latter (Mother \nEarth, Mother Nature). Without the female principle (women) man \nwouldn \'t be here. . . . Witchcraft is a pre-Christian faith. . . . It tends to \nbe matriarchal whereas both Christianity and Satanism are patriarchal and \n\n\n\nurn \n\n\n\nmale chauvinist. The latter two are merely opposite sides of the same Witchcraft \n\ncoin. Witchcraft, as the Old Religion, is a coin of a different vintage, \n\npredating both. 55 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nAsked how he feels about belonging to a heavily matriarchal \ntradition, one male witch answered: "I\'d rather be first mate on a ship \nthat is solid than captain on a ship that has a rotten hull, a ship that is \nsinking. Patriarchy is such a ship." Witches have defined patriarchy as \n"manipulative and domineering." The matriarchal world view, on \nthe other hand, values "feelings of connectedness and intuition . . . \nnonauthoritarian and nondestructive power relationships." It is \nclaimed that witchcraft tends to correct what W. Holman Keith called \nthe fundamental religious error of our time: "to substitute force as the \ndivine and ruling principle in place of beauty and love, to make \ndestruction, in which the prowess of the male excels, more important \nin life than the creativity of the female." 56 \n\nCertainly the history of witchcraft shows men persecuting women \nin order to maintain a male monopoly of profitable enterprises, such \nas medicine and magic. Women of outstanding reputation in any field \nwere at risk, since almost any woman\'s accomplishment could be \ndefined as witchcraft. When the church declared war on female healers, \nhealing became a crime punishable by death if it was practiced by a \nwoman. Women were forbidden to study medicine, and "if a woman \ndare to cure without having studied, she is a witch and must die." 57 \nDoctors eagerly participated in witch hunts, to eliminate their competi- \ntion. It was all done very deliberately. "Given the number of \ninstances in which the church combined with various economic groups \nfrom doctors to lawyers to merchant guilds, not only to make \npronouncements about the incapacities of women, but often to accom- \nplish the physical liquidation of women through witchcraft and heresy \ntrials, one can hardly say that it all happened without anyone intending \nit." 58 \n\nChurchmen who availed themselves of witches\' services some- \ntimes persecuted even those who helped them, in remarkable \nexamples of ingratitude. Alison Peirsoun of Byrehill was so famous as a \nhealing witch that the archbishop of St. Andrews sent for her when \nhe was sick, and she cured him. Later he not only refused to pay her fee, \nbut had her arrested, charged with witchcraft and burned. 59 \n\nThe muddy illogic of persecutors\' sexist thinking is nowhere better \nillustrated than in the notion of the witch\'s "poppet," or wax doll, \nwhich could be mistreated by piercing or melting in order to make a \nhuman victim suffer corresponding stabbing pains, fevers, and other \ntroubles. When the witch destroyed the doll altogether, the victim \nwould die. Yet oddly enough, when male authorities discovered the \ndoll and destroyed it, the victim would not die but would recover. A \nsimilar sexist attitude was apparent in the whole idea of traffic \nbetween human beings and demons. Burton\'s Criminal Trials of \n\n\n\n1089 \n\n\n\nWitchcraft Scotland stated that a male sorcerer is the master of demons, but a \n\nfemale witch is the slave of demons. 60 Yet her offense was usually \n^^^^^^^^ i^^ considered more punishable than his. \n\nModern witches, male and female, seem inclined to restore the \nsexual balance of old romances, where men\'s magical skills were \nacquired under feminine instruction. 61 The witches appear to be recon- \nstructing an old religion in a new format, gradually working out a \ntheology that owes more to ancient Indo-European models than to the \n"reverse Christianity" associated with the idea of Satanism. Important \npoints upon which this theology differs from Christianity are the \nfollowing: \n\n(1) The female principle is deified, equal to or greater than the \nmale. (2) Body and soul are seen as one and the same; one cannot ex- \nist without the other. (3) Nature is sacred, not to be abused or \n"conquered." (4) The individual will has intrinsic value and is not to \nbe subordinated to the "revealed" will of a deity. (5) Time is circular \nand repetitive; existence is cyclic; the figures of the Triple Goddess \nsymbolize constant repetitions of growth and decay. (6) There is no \noriginal sin, and no hard-and-fast separation of "good" and "evil" (for \nexample, a feast of fresh beef is good for the feasters but evil for the \nonce-living main dish). (7) Sexuality, spontaneity, humor, and play \nactivities may be incorporated into ritual, where the experience of \npleasure is regarded as a positive force in life, rather than a temptation \nor a sin. 62 \n\nThe Goddess speaks to modern witches in somewhat the same \nvein as the speeches drawn from her ancient scriptures: \n\nMine is the secret that opens upon the door of youth and mine is the Cup \nof the Wine of Life and the Cauldron ofCerridwen, which is the Holy \nGrail of Immortality. lam the Gracious Goddess who gives the gift of joy \nunto the heart of man upon earth. I give the knowledge of the Spirit \nEternal, and beyond death I give peace and freedom and reunion with \nthose that have gone before. . . . I who am the beauty of the Green \nEarth, and the White Moon amongst the stars and the mystery of the \nWaters, and the desire of the heart of man, I call unto thy soul to arise \nand come unto me. For lam the Soul of Nature whogiveth life to the \nuniverse; from me all things proceed and unto me all things must \nreturn. . . . I have been with thee from the beginning, and lam that whici \nis attained at the end of desire. 6i \n\n1. J.H. Smith, D.C.P., 241. 2. Bullough, 177. 3. White 2, 36. 4. Briffault 1, 488. \n\n5.

The day sacred to him was Wednesday \nWoden\'s Day. German churchmen eventually changed the name of \nthe day to Mittwoch, "mid-week," to prevent speaking of the heathen \ndeity\'s name. \n\nWednesday is Mercury\'s Day in Latin-based languages (Italian \nmercoledi, French mercredi, Spanish miercoles), because Woden- \nOdin was identified with the Roman Mercury (Hermes). As a \nConductor of Souls, Woden was associated with the cult of the dead, \nwho were formerly called "elves" in Scandinavia; therefore he evolved \ninto the Elven-king, Erl King, and leader of the Wild Hunt, when \nghosts rode through the sky at Halloween. As Hod, the slayer of the \nyear-god Balder, he appeared in his death mask and hood as a \nmalicious deity, Old Carl Hood, father of the greenwood-hero Robin. 1 \nChristians readily identified him with the devil because he was \nalready a fearful deity of death very like the Hindu Yama. \n\n1. Wimberly, 200. \n\n\n\nvar. Wotan \n\n\n\nWolf \n\nSacred totem of many European clans during the Middle Ages, as \nshown by the frequency of the name Wolf or Wulf in place names and \nfamily surnames. The old Saxon year began with Wolf-monath \n(Wolf Month). Wolf mothers or wolf nurses figured prominently in the \nbiographies of pagan heroes. An early version of Siegfried was nursed \nby a divine she-wolf and was named Wolfdietrich. 1 \n\nWorship of the wolf among heathen clans led to innumerable \nsuperstitions about wolf-demons and werewolves. Wolves were asso- \nciated with death and reincarnation, since they were carrion eaters, \nformerly believed to carry the dead in their own bodies to the pagan \nheavens and hells. See Dog; Werewolf. \n\n1. Rank, 58. \n\n\n\nWomb \n\nThe Sanskrit word for any temple or sanctuary was garbha-grha, \n"womb." \' \n\nThe great annual festival of Aphrodite in Argos was called Hyste- \ni,"Womb." 2 \n\n\n\n1091 \n\n\n\nWorid ^ The oldest oracle in Greece, sacred to the Great Mother of earth, \n\nWormwood sea, and sky, was named Delphi, from delphos, "womb." \n\nMegalithic tombs and barrow-mounds were designed as "wombs" \n" "^^^^^^" to give rebirth to the dead. Their vaginal entrance passages show that \nNeolithic folk went to considerable trouble to devise imitations of \nfemale anatomy in earth and stone. Tomb and womb were even \nrelated linguistically. Greek tumbos, Latin tumulus were cognates of \ntumere, to swell, to be pregnant. The word "tummy" is thought to \nhave come from the same root. 3 \n\nWomb-temples and womb-tombs point backward to the matriar- \nchal age, when only feminine life-magic was thought efficacious. \nRebirth from the womb-tomb was the meaning of the domed funerary \nstupa of the Far East, where the remains of the sainted dead lay \nwithin a structure called garbha, the "womb." 4 The parallel with barro \ngraves, Mycenaean tholos tombs, cave temples, and other such \nstructures is now well known. Even a Christian cathedral centered on \nthe space called nave, originally meaning "belly." Caves and burial \nchambers were said to be sunk in the "bowels" of the earth that is, of \nMother Earth. The biblical term for "birth" is "separation from the \nbowels." \n\nArchetypal womb-symbolism is as common today as it ever was, \nthough not always recognized as such. Paul Klee said, "Which artist \nwould not wish to dwell at the central organ of all motion . . . from \nwhich all functions derive their life? In the womb of nature, in the \nprimal ground of creation, where the secret key to all things lies \nhidden?" 5 \n\n1. Campbell, CM., 168. 2. H.Smith, 126. 3. Potter & Sargent, 28. 4.

Her spirit was \nthought to inhabit grave-worms (maggots), for which the Old Norse \nword was mathkr, Old English matha both related to "mother." The \nmodern word descended from a Middle English derivative, mawke} \nLinguistically related to these "worms" were the Goddess\'s familiars oi \nmawkins. See Cat. \n\n1. Potter & Sargent, 238. \n\n\n\nWormwood \n\nArtemisia absinthium, wormwood, was sacred to the Great Mother. \nTrevisa wrote in 1398: "Artemisia is called mother of herbs, and was \n\n\n\n1092 \n\n\n\nsometime hallowed to the goddess that hight [is named] Artemis." \' Wudu-Maer \n\nIn Russia, wormwood or absinth was called an "accursed herb" because Xipe Totec \n\nit was sacred to the pagan nymphs (Vilas); but it had also protective ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmagic. 2 \n\nWormwood was a corruption of Old English wermod, "spirit- \nmother," which became German Wermut, French vermouth. \nAbsinthe was first prepared by French witches from artemisia, and \nbecame a commercial product in the 1 8th century, though it proved \nvery dangerous. Wormwood is a habit-forming drug that can destroy \nbrain cells and cause delirium; furthermore, commercial absinthe was \n68% alcohol by volume. 3 During the 19th century, the French govern- \nment outlawed its production. 4 \n\n1.

In Bavaria, the wudu-maerwere presented with offerings of \nfoodstuffs to court their goodwill; they were known as Little Wood \nWomen. 1 A similar concept of a forest priestess survived in English \nlegends of Maid Marian. See Robin. \n\nl.Fra/.er,F.O.T.,312. \n\n\n\nXikum \n\nBabylonian Tree of Heaven, emblem of Ishtar, spreading her \nbranches into the celestial and nether worlds, holding the Savior \nTammuz in her midst. 1 Moslems diabolized this Mother-tree and \nmentioned her in the Koran as Zakkum, the Tree of Hell. 2 See Fig. \n\n1.

He was castrated and flayed, and the priest was clothed in his \nbloody skin, signifying the god\'s rebirth. 1 People carried new fire \nfrom his temple to re-kindle their household fires, believing that his \ndeath staved off the end of the world, at least for one more cycle. 2 \n\nXipe Totec was the son of the Demeter-like Corn-goddess Chico- \nmecoatl. Like all gods of crops, he suffered in imitation of reaping \nand grinding the grain. His flaying may have represented the husking of \nthe corn cobs. \n\n\n\n1093 \n\n\n\nXochiquetzal \nYahweh \n\n\n\nThe "Flayed One" bore a remarkable resemblance to the archaic \nHindu god Rudra, the Red One, or the Howler, or the Lord Who Is \nHalf Woman. Rudra too was associated mystically with the Pleiades, \ncalled the Seven Mothers of the World, or Krittikas ("cutters"), \nwhose "cutting" function may have been castrating or even flaying \nsacrificial gods. 3 - \n\n1.

Like Syrian Adonis, her son-lover was a young vegetation god. 1 \n\nHer worshippers said Xochiquetzal was the mother of all races of \nhumanity after the primordial flood. Her many children were as \ndumb as animals until her holy spirit in the form of a dove descended oi \nthem from the Tree of Heaven and gave them speech. In this way all \nthe world\'s languages were created. 2 \n\nIn addition to the dove, another symbol Xochiquetzal shared with \nthe ancient Indo-European Goddesses was her sacred flower, the \nmarigold perhaps a New World version of the golden Thousand- \nPetaled Lotus representing the Great Mother in India. \n\nXochiquetzal\'s paradise was located "above the nine heavens in a \nvery pleasant and delectable place, accompanied and guarded by \nmany people and waited on by other women of the rank of goddesses, \nwhere are many delights of fountains, brooks, flower-gardens." 3 This \nfairyland was available after death to those who faithfully served the \nGoddess and lived according to her laws. \n\n1.

It \nwas also rendered Yah, Yahu, Jahveh, Jahi, or Jehovah, and has been \n\n\n\n1094 \n\n\n\nrelated to the name of the Canaanite moon deity Yareah, possibly a Yama \n\nfemale or androgynous form. A male Yahweh was married to the Yang and Yin \n\nCanaanite mother goddess Anat at Elephantine. 1 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nThe name of God pronounced Jaho, Iao, or Ieuw was applied to \nZeus-Sabazius as the nocturnal sun: a Lord of Death under the earth, \nlike Saturn. Jews called him Sabbaoth, "Lord of Hosts.". His Latin name \ncame from the same roots: Iu-piter, "Father leu," that is, Jupiter or \nJove. 2 \n\nJahi was also a very ancient Goddess, appearing in Persian scrip- \ntures as the maker and seducer of the first man. Like many other \nCreatresses, she mated with the primal serpent; she also gave the \nmenstrual "blood of life" to Eve. \n\n1. Hays, 85, 89. 2. Knight, D.W.P., 113. \n\n\n\nYama \n\nHindu Lord of Death, male counterpart of the Lady of Life, whose \nname was his own in reversal: Ma-Ya. In classic Hindu myth, however, \nYama\'s consort was his twin sister Yami, a feminine form of himself. \nThe Fates ordained that he should mate with her, in the manner of the \nPrimal Androgyne (see Androgyne). But Yama refused, saying he \nintended to keep himself pure. Because he detached himself from his \nfeminine half and renounced the life-supporting power of the female, \nhe became the first man to die. 1 He went into the underworld and \nbecame its king. \n\nThis myth presents an interesting reversal of the Judeo-Christian \nnotion that the sin of woman and sex brought death into the world. \nHere death came about through the sin of male asceticism; Yama \n"died" because he refused to be a sexual being. His followers revered \nhim as a psychopomp, like Hermes after his detachment from Aphro- \ndite: "Yama chose death, and he found out the path for many, and he \ngives the souls of the dead a resting place." 2 \n\nAs Lord of Death he took the title Samana, "the Leveller," and at \ntimes he wore the fearsome aspect of a blue-skinned, bull-headed \ndemon, the same as Sammael, the Angel of Death in the Book of \nEnoch. 3 Persians worshipped him as Yima the Splendid, the Good \nShepherd who gave men immortality. 4 In the ancient land of Canaan, \nhe became Yamm, Lord of the Abyss, annually cast down by Baal in \ntheir eternal contest for the favors of Astarte. \n\n1.

Though \n\n\n\nYggdrasil \n\n\n\nnow regarded as a bisexual emblem, the Yang and Yin symbol was onc< \nwholly feminine. During the Sung period it referred to the cyclic \nphases of the moon. 1 Yin, the female power in the mandala, was a \ncognate of "yoni." \n\n1. Campbell, Or.M., 24. \n\n\n\nYantra \n\nTantric "meditation sign," the graphic or symbolic equivalent of a \nmantra. Most important was the Sri Yantra or Great Yantra, a design of \ntwo interlocking triangles representing time cycles and the union of \nGoddess and God (see Hexagram). 1 Worship of the yantra was meant \nto attain "unity with the Mother of the Universe." 2 \n\n1. Rawson, AT., 82. 2. Avalon, 428. \n\n\n\nYard \n\nFrom Scandinavian gard or garth, "world," the earth. 1 The church- \nyard descended from the old pagan tradition that a temple and its \nenvirons constituted a model of the universe, and those buried in the \nyard corresponding to the Greek koimeteria, "cemetery" automati- \ncally entered paradise because they were already in its vicinity (i.e., \nclose to the temple). This was the pagan belief underlying the Christian \nhabit of burying the pious in "consecrated ground" adjacent to the \nchurch. Refusal of such burial to criminals, witches, and other outcasts \nwas tantamount to sending them to hell, for it was believed that \nanyone buried in unhallowed ground was automatically damned. \n\nl.Lethaby.62. \n\n\n\nYggdrasil \n\n"Terrible Horse," or "The Horse of Ygg [the Ogre]"; Norse name of \nthe World Ash Tree that became Odin\'s gallows tree a gallows being \npoetically likened to a horse (drasil) on which men rode to Death. \nLike Christ\'s cross, Yggdrasil was depicted as the axis mundi. Its roots \nsupported the earth, its trunk passed through the world\'s hub, its \nbranches stretched over heaven and were hung with the stars. Under its \nroots by the Fount of Wisdom lived the three Fate-goddesses or \nNorns. A mighty serpent constantly gnawed at the tree and at doomsday \nwould succeed in toppling the entire structure. All the worlds it \nupheld Earth, heaven, Midgard, Asgard were destined to tumble \ndown and fall apart. See Doomsday; Odin. \n\n\n\n1096 \n\n\n\nYin Yin \n\nFeminine life force, a Chinese cognate of "yoni "; usually represented om \n\nas a fluid emanating from a female "Grotto of the White Tiger" ^^^^mmmm^mm^ \n\n(genitals). 1 According to the doctrines of Tao, the power of yin was \nstronger than any male power; therefore men had to learn to take \nfeminine fluids into themselves, to gain wisdom and health. \n1. Rawson, E.A., 253. \n\n\n\nYmir \n\nTeutonic giant who died to give life to the universe. His flesh became \nthe soil; his blood became rivers and seas; his skull was the dome of the \nsky. The first couple of male-and-female beings emerged from the \nsweat of his left armpit. The race of dwarves evolved from maggots that \nbred in Ymir\'s rotting corpse. This pantheistic creation myth was \ndesigned to give primordial significance to a sacrificial god; but Ymir \nwas not really the first of all creatures. He was brought to life and \nnourished by the Cow-mother Audumla, "Creator of Earth." \n\nYmir\'s name has been related to the Sanskrit Yama, the oldest \nunderworld god in hermaphroditic guise as a producer of living \nthings. 2 As Odin was another form of Indra, so Ymir was the Yama \nremembered by Aryan tribes in their westward migrations. \n\nl.Urousse, 248. 2. H.R.E. Davidson, G.M.V.A., 151, 199. \n\n\n\nYoga \n\nSanskrit yoga meant to link, join, or unite, like the English derivative \n"yoke." It was the term for sexual union between the Tantric sadhu and \nhis yogini, or Shakti, in imitation of the union between Kali and \nShiva. As Kali\'s consort, Shiva bore the title of "Lord of Yoga." l \n\nThe practice of yoga was supposed to develop magic powers \ncollectively called siddhi in northern Europe, sidh or seidr, "mag- \nic." The fully developed sage could walk on water, change base metals \nto gold, understand all languages, heal diseases, cast out demons, and \nso on. 2 The Moors called such a person a sidi, "hero." In the myth \ncycles of Moorish Spain, the title itself became a name of the greatest \nknown hero, El Cid. ? \n\n1. Campbell, Or.M., 13. 2. Bardo Thodol, 158; Campbell, Or.M, 424. \n3. Goodrich, 236. \n\n\n\nYoni \n\n"Vulva," the primary Tantric object of worship, symbolized variously \nby a triangle, fish, double-pointed oval, horseshoe, egg, fruits, etc. \n\n\n\n1097 \n\n\n\nYonijas \n\nYule \n\n\n\nPersonifying the yoni, the Goddess Kali bore the title of Cunti or \nKunda, root of the ubiquitous Indo-European word "cunt" and all its \nrelatives: cunnus, cunte, cunning, cunctipotent, ken, kin, country. \n\nThe Yoni Yantra or triangle was known as the Primordial Image, \nrepresenting the Great Mother as source of all life. 1 As the genital \nfocus of her divine energy, the Yantra was adored as a geometrical \nsymbol, as the cross was adored by Christians. \n\nThe ceremony of baptismal rebirth often involved being drawn \nbodily through a giant yoni. Those who underwent this ceremony \nwere styled "twice-born." 2 \n\n1. Silberer, 170. 2. Frazer, G.B., 229. \n\n\n\nYonijas \n\nA Hindu myth of the battle of the sexes told of a quarrel between the \nGoddess Parvati (Kali) and the God Mahadeva (Shiva) over their rival \nclaims to the true parenthood of human beings. To decide the \nquestion, each proposed to create a race of people without the aid of the \nother. The God, spirit of the lingam or phallus, created the Lingajas, \nwho were weak and stupid, "dull of intellect, their bodies feeble, their \nlimbs distorted." \n\nHowever, the Goddess created the Yonijas, spirits of the yoni or \nvulva, who turned out to be excellent specimens: "well-shaped, with \nsweet aspects and fine complexions." 1 The two races fought a war, and \nthe Yonijas won. \n\nThis may have been one of the earliest myths of conflict between \nmale and female divinities over the matter of who did the creating. It \nwas still a matriarchal age, as shown by the way the Mother made more \nviable people than the Father could make. \n\n1. Simons, 57. \n\n\n\nvar. Yul Yule \n\nNorse solstitial festival, the season of the sun\'s rebirth, assimilated to \nChristmas in the Middle Ages, along with its pagan trappings: holly, ivy, \npine boughs, lighted trees, wassail bowls, suckling pigs, Yule logs, \ncarols, gifts, and feasting. \n\nSome said the god of Yule was Kris Kringle, i.e., a Christ of the \nOrb, a new solar king. But most northern folk remembered the \nreborn god as Frey. They said, "Yule is celebrated in honor of Frey." \' \n\nIn France it was celebrated in honor of another phallic god, like \nCernunnos, whose phallus was identified with the festive log, called \nthe Noel Log. Provencal folk songs mention the fertility magic of the \n\n\n\n1098 \n\n\n\nNoel Log, the ashes of which were traditionally mixed with cows\' Yu-Ti \n\nfodder to help them calve. 2 Zalmoxis \n\n1. Oxenstierna, 216. 2. Briffault 3, 101-2. ^^^^___^^__ \n\n\n\nYu-Ti \n\nChinese Heavenly Father, consort of Mother Earth (Wang-Mu). He \nwas known as the August Personage of Jade, or August Supreme \nEmperor of Jade. He lived in heaven in a palace exactly like the \nearthly emperor\'s palace. He was said to have made the first human \nbeings out of clay, like other archaic gods whose "creating" took \nplace before the concept of begetting was understood. 1 \n\n\\.Larousse, 381-82. \n\n\n\nZabat \n\nBerber name for sacred dances performed in groups of thirteen, in \nconnection with the magic ceremony called "an occasion of power"; \npossible origin of the so-called witches\' "sabbat." \' \n\n1. Shah, 210; Ravensdale & Morgan, 1 53. \n\n\n\nZagreus \n\nCretan bull-god and savior identified with both Dionysus the Son, \nand Zeus the Father. Zagreus was slain by the Titans (pre-Hellenic \ngods) as a sacrifice, then assimilated to his heavenly father and \nresurrected as a new copy of himself, by rebirth through the Mother \n(Rhea). \n\n\n\nZakar \n\nHebrew "male," from several ancient words for "penis." Zakar or \nZaqar was a phallic deity like Hermes in Babylon, where he was called a \nmessenger from the moon. Zekker, the Arabic word for "penis," \ncame from a similar Egyptian root: Seker, the Lord of Death, i.e., Osiris \nas the dead god (or phallus) hidden within the Mother\'s womb. See \nSeker. \n\n\n\nZalmoxis \n\nSavior of Thrace, worshipped by the Getae and identified with \nOrpheus. Zalmoxis promised eternal life to guests at his sacramental \n\n\n\n1099 \n\n\n\nZar Last Supper. Then he went into the underworld, and rose again on \nZephyr the third day or, by some accounts, in the third year. He established \nsacred Mysteries to teach the secrets of the after-life. Human sacri- \nfices to him were impaled, like victims impersonating Tmolus in Lydia \n(see Heracles). 1 Martyrdom as the spirit of Zalmoxis apparently was \ncoveted. If the victim survived after being hurled onto the points of \nspears, he was rebuked and designated a "bad man"; and another was \nchosen to die in his place. 2 \n\n1. Herodotus, 241-42. 2. Guthrie, 175. \n\n\n\nZar \n\nEthiopian demon, still worshipped by women as the spirit of their \nvoodoo-like cult of possession, to which they have recourse when \noppressed by their patriarchal society. The name Zar may be related \nto an ancient name of Osiris, worshipped during the first dynasty at \nAbydos as the god-king Zer, who became Lord of the Underworld. \n\n\n\nZen \n\nJapanese system of controlled meditation, to master various skills, \nespecially the martial arts. Zen was a mispronunciation of Chinese \nch \'an, which was in turn a mispronunciation of Sanskrit dhyana, \n"contemplation." \' Medieval knights of romance, who worshipped Di- \nana and followed a similar martial-arts cult, may have drawn their \ntradition from the same Oriental source. \n\n1. Campbell, M.T.L.B., 127; Or.M., 440. \n\n\n\nZenobia \n\nDynastic name of matriarchal queens of Palmyra. In their native \nAramaic, the name was Bath-Zabbai, or Bath-Sheba, meaning "Daugh- \nter of the Goddess." See Solomon and Sheba. The famous queen \nZenobia Septimia was the "seventh Bath-Sheba." x She had no official \nconsort. She named her son Wahab-Allath, "Gift of the Goddess \nAllath." Allath was the same Semitic Moon-mother whom Islam later \nmasculinized as Allah. 2 \n\n1. Encyc. Brit., "Zenobia." 2. de Riencourt, 75. \n\n\n\nZephyr \n\nGreek wind-spirit, capable of impregnating women or female ani- \nmals, as Boreas the North Wind was thought to impregnate mares. \nGreek phallic gods often appeared in carvings and amulets as "snake- \n\n\n\n1100 \n\n\n\ntailed winds." The idea that fatherhood resulted from sending air, Zeus \n\nbreath, or wind into a womb was not only a Greek idea. It was Ziusudra \n\ncommon to early patriarchal religions, which taught the male Oversoul ^^^^^^^^^^ \nwas nothing but air. See Soul. \n\n\n\nZeus \n\nGreek form of Sanskrit Dyauspitar, "Father Heaven," probably \nlinked with Babylonian myths of Zu the Storm-Bird, a thrower of \nthunderbolts. The Romans called him Jupiter, or Jove; the Jews \ncalled him Jehovah. \n\nUnlike the Judeo-Christian God who assumed his attributes, Zeus \nwas not a creator of humanity, nor even a giver of laws. The real \nCreator-lawgiver was the Goddess called either his mother or his wife: \nRhea, Hera, Gaea; in all her forms a "Virgin Mother of God." Zeus \nwas entitled Mamas, "Virgin-born Zeus." \' He was also identified with a \nnumber of dying gods, such as Zeus-Sabazius, Zeus-Zagreus, Zeus- \nSabaoth. Like Lucifer, he "came down" as rain or lightning to fertilize \nhis Mother, the earth. As a god of the fructifying bolt, he was known \nas Zeus Kataibates, "Zeus Who Descends." 2 He took over Mount \nOlympus, former shrine of Gaea Olympia. \n\nZeus eventually became the Olympic-Platonic patriarch, even \nclaiming to give birth to Athene the ancient Libyan Goddess of \nfemale wisdom from his own head. "With the spread of Platonic \nphilosophy the hitherto intellectually dominant Greek woman degen- \nerated into an unpaid worker and breeder of children wherever Zeus \nand Apollo were the ruling gods." 3 \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 320. 2. Guthrie, 38. 3. Graves, G.M. 1,117. \n\n\n\nZiggurat \n\nBabylonian "Mountain of Heaven," the pyramid that served as \ntemple and palace in Mesopotamian towns. At its summit, the king \nconsummated his sacred marriage with the Goddess, this being the \npoint of contact between heaven and earth. Nebuchadnezzar\'s ziggurat \nwas built in seven stages, representing the seven planetary spheres. \nBeneath, seven nether pits represented the descent into the correspond- \ning seven spheres of the underworld. Such pits were used for \ndeath-and-rebirth ceremonies of priestly initiations. See Mountain. \n\n\n\nZiusudra \n\nSumerian prototype of Noah, the flood hero, carrying the seeds of a \nnew universe through watery Chaos between destruction of one world \nand the birth of the next. Sometimes spelled Xisuthros. See Flood. \n\n\n\n1101 \n\n\n\nZoe Zoe \n\nZurvan "Life," a Gnostic name of Eve, comparable to the Teutonic All- \n\n^^Ma^MBHHMB Mother Lif. \' Zoe was a daughter or emanation of the Gnostic Goddess, \nSophia, who gave Adam his soul. She also threw down to the Abyss \nthe unjust Creator, who had dared to curse her, and elevated the Lord \nof Hosts to the seventh heaven, where she undertook to instruct him \nabout the eighth, the Great Mother\'s dwelling place. Gnostic Gospels \nsaid Zoe\'s power alone animated the first clay man, after various gods \nhad tried to do it and failed. Therefore the man called her Mother of All \nLiving. 2 The canonical Bible kept her title, but eliminated her giving \nof life to Adam. \n\n1. Pagels, 30. 2. Robinson, 159, 166-69, 172-76. \n\n\n\nvar. Zarathustra Zoroaster \n\nPatriarchal Persian prophet whose name was affixed to many anti- \nfemale doctrines, such as the rule that no women could enter heaven \nexcept those "submissive to control, who had considered their hus- \nbands lords." \' Most women, of course, were destined to go to hell. \nAlong with much else, these sentiments were adopted from Zoroas- \ntrian teaching by the Jews and applied to the laws of Yahweh. \n\n1. Campbell, Oc.M., 196, 199. \n\n\n\nZorya \n\nThe "Three Fates" in Slavic myth. "Three little sisters, three little \nZorya: she of the Evening, she of Midnight, and she of Morning" i.e., \nof the old lunar calendars that figured the day from noon to noon. \nLike the Norns, the Zorya kept the doomsday-wolf fettered to the pole \nstar: "Their duty is to guard a dog which is tied by an iron chain to \nthe constellation of the Little Bear. When the chain breaks it will be the \nend of the world." l An Egyptian prototype of the triple Zorya was \nthe Goddess Reret, who kept the powers of destruction fettered by a \nchain. 2 \n\n1. Lamusse, 285. 2. Budge, G.E. 2, 249. \n\n\n\nZurvan \n\nArchaic Persian deity of Infinite Time, two-faced or two-sexed in \nZoroastrian symbolism. Zurvan must have been originally a manifesta- \ntion of the Two Ladies of life and death, like Kali who united Virgin \nand Crone aspects of female divinity. From the womb of Zurvan were \nborn the twins Ahura Mazda (God) and Ahriman (Satan). The \nformer twin became king of heaven because he made the right sacri- \n\n\n\n1102 \n\n\n\nfices. Ahriman\'s sacrifices were unacceptable, so he was banished to \nthe underworld and became the Great Serpent. 1 \n\nZurvan Akarana was worshipped as the First Cause, or principle of \ncreation, linked with Time, Destiny, and Fate: three common \ncharacterizations of the Goddess. 2 An ancient scripture said her divinity \ncould not even be addressed; it was "so incomprehensible to man that \nwe can but honor it in awed silence." ? Thus Zurvan was similar to the \nGnostic Goddess Sige, origin of all things in Silence. Ahura could \nhave been one of her early names. In Egypt, Ahura was feminine. 4 \n\nThe Zoroastrian pantheon assigned Zurvan to the dark side of \ndivinity as a demon of decrepitude, very like the Crone Kali who \nrepresented moribund old age. 5 Patriarchal thinkers characteristically \nemphasized the negative aspects of the destroying-and-creating God- \ndess, even when the primal character of the Mother of good, evil, time, \nfate, and the universe was clearly discernible under the veneer of later \nmyth. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
