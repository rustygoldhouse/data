He hath joined his seed with his body, so that his \negg existed in his secret self. ... He had no mother, who might have \ngiven him his name. ... He who hath shaped his egg himself, the \nmighty one of mysterious birth, who (himself) created his beauty." Such \nabstractions failed to satisfy the literal-minded Egyptian, who wanted \nto know how Ra did it. Priests responded with the same evasiveness that \nmodern priesthoods also exhibit: \n\nHis image is not spread out in books. . . . He is too mysterious that his \nglory should be revealed, too great that men should question concern- \ning him, too powerful that he should be known. One falleth down dead on \nthe spot for terror, if his mysterious, unknowable name is pronounced. \nNo god can address him by it, him with the spirit, whose name is hidden, \nfor that he is a mystery. 6 \n\nYet Ra was not only the Goddess\'s child; he may even have \nbeen a masculinized version of the Goddess herself. One of her ancient \nnames was Ra with a feminine ending -r: "Ra-t of the two lands, the \nlady of heaven, mistress of the gods . . . mistress of Heliopolis." Her full \nname was Rat-taiut, "Ra-t of the world." 7 Her city, translated into \nGreek as Heliopolis, was the Egyptian Anu, which the Bible calls On. \nThe Goddess really controlled Ra by means of his secret soul-name. \nEach day she laid on him an unbreakable spell, forcing him to grow old \nand senile as he limped on his cane toward his death at sunset. She \nforced him to stand still at the summit of heaven while she resurrected \nher son Horus from the dead, a feat on which the Jews modeled their \nmyth of Joshua\'s arrest of the sun at the battle of Jericho. 8 \n\nThe Jews enthusiastically adopted Ra and identified him with \nYahweh, especially in his Babylonian form as the sun god Shamash \n\n\n\n838 \n\n\n\n(Chemosh). Beth-Shemesh, House of the Sun, was a biblical version of Rabbatu \n\nthe sun god\'s shrine, corresponding to Egyptian per Ra. The God of Ragnarok \n\nMoses followed Ra\'s custom, demanding that his worshipper go bare- > ^ 1 ^ m \n\nfoot in his presence. "Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place \nwhereon thou standest is holy ground" (Exodus 3:5). 9 Sometimes the \nJews called their sun god Elias, a corruption of the Greek Helios. \nElias was the "father" Jesus called upon from the cross (Matthew \n27:47-49). \n\n1.

Heimdall would \nannounce the last battle of the gods by blowing the Last Trump on his \nhorn; there would follow the destruction of the earth, the disappear- \nance of the sun, the death of all gods, and the return of the world to its \noriginal state of chaos. \n\n\n\n839 \n\n\n\nRainbow \n\n\n\nUpanishads \n\nBuddhist scriptures \nrepresenting the final \nstage in Vedic thought, \ndealing with the \nphilosophy known as \nVedanta. The Katha \nUpanishad discusses \ntransmigration of \nsouls, the nature of \neternal life, the \ndoctrine of maya, and \nan account of a visit \nto Yama, Lord of the \nDead. \n\n\n\nRainbow \n\nMyths often associate the rainbow with the dream-time or Golden \nAge when earth and heaven were in easy communication with one \nanother. Deities, spirits, and mortals might pass back and forth on the \nrainbow bridge, which was also the axis mundi, or ladder of heaven, or \nnecklace of the Great Mother who ruled the Golden Age. The Pot of \nGold at the rainbow\'s end was another form of the Celts\' Holy Grail, a \nwomb symbol related to the pots where Mother Moon (Mana) kept \nthe souls of the dead in her western paradise. 1 \n\nThe rainbow\'s seven colors represented the seven celestial spheres \nand the rainbow-hued veils of Maya, the Goddess working behind \nthe veils to manifest the material world in its many-colored complexity. \nHer priestesses wore the colors of the veils, which appeared in \nEgyptian mythology as the seven stoles of Isis, and in the Bible as the \nseven veils of Salome. 2 \n\nThe rainbow veils of the Goddess Ishtar were sometimes gar- \nments, sometimes jewels. The rainbow was called her necklace, of \nwhich she made the bridge to heaven for the souls of her chosen ones. \nHer rainbow necklace had selective power. If the Goddess willed, \nneither man nor god could cross it. On one occasion she placed her \nrainbow to block the Heavenly Father from receiving the food laid on \nearth\'s altars, to punish him after he sent the Flood to destroy her \nearthly children. 3 Biblical writers re-interpreted this Babylonian myth \nto omit the Goddess and make the rainbow represent God\'s promise to \nNoah not to do it again. \n\nThe rainbow\'s selectivity is a common motif. The glowing bridge \nwas a broad way for the chosen, a razor-edge for the wicked. The \nKatha Upanishad said the rainbow bridge to heaven is as difficult to \ntraverse as the edge of a razor. 4 The Persians said the same of their \nKinvad or Cinvat rainbow bridge: "For the just it is nine lance-lengths \nwide, for the ungodly it is as narrow as the edge of a razor. The \nCinvat bridge is at the \'Center\' ... the bridge connects earth and \nheaven at the \'Center.\'" 5 Christian tradition spoke of the same \nselective bridge of heaven: "Narrow is the way . . . and few there be that \nfind it" (Matthew 7:14). \n\nThe Japanese said the rainbow is "the road of the gods and the \nbridge between sky and earth." As in India and Mesopotamia, its \nseven colors were associated with the seven heavens. "The throne of \nthe Supreme Being is surrounded by a rainbow, and the same \nsymbolism persists into the Christian art of the Renaissance." The sex of \nthe Supreme Being was changed by patriarchal theology, but the \nsymbol still suggests the archaic Maya-Shakti enveloped in her rainbow \nveils. "Shamanic drums are decorated with drawings of the rainbow \n\nrepresented as a bridge to the sky In the Turkic language the word \n\nfor rainbow means bridge." 6 \n\nNorthern pagans also said the Goddess\'s rainbow necklace and the \n\n\n\n840 \n\n\n\nrainbow Bridge of Heaven were one and the same. 7 Freya\'s magic \nnecklace Brisingamen was the same as the rainbow bridge called Bifrost \nor Bilrost, the "trembling way," also known as Asbru, "bridge of the \ngods." 8 During the Christian era, this rainbow bridge became one of \nthe features of Fairyland. Heathen legend said as doomsday ap- \nproached, the bridge would be broken down so there was no more \ncommunication between earth and heaven. In effect this meant \nmortals would no longer go to heaven, neither in the shamanic trance \nnor in the spirit after death. \n\nGreeks personified the rainbow as the Goddess Iris, usually called \nHera\'s messenger, one more instance of the Great Goddess\'s associa- \ntion with the garment of many colors, Maya\'s or Isis\'s veils. As the \n"bridge," Iris carried Mother Hera\'s messages to earth as the rain- \nbow-hued peacock carried the messages of Mother Juno. Iris also bound \nthe Nemean Lion with her colorful girdle and carried it to the sacred \ncave in the Nemean mountains. \n\n1. Davidson, 34. 2. Angus, 251. 3. Assyr. & Bab. Lit, 434. 4.

The ram was often selected for the dubious \nhonor of sacrifice, being identified with the god who immolated \nhimself to himself for the sake of humanity. \n\nSolar gods were linked with the heavenly ram Aries, who began \nthe sacred year, dead and reborn as the new Aeon. Egyptians called \nhim Amen-Ra, "the Ram, the virile male, the holy phallus, which \nstirreth up the passions of love, the Ram of rams." \' \n\nThe Ram Caught in a Thicket was a sexual metaphor and a \ncommon religious icon in Abraham\'s legendary home, Ur of the \nChaldees. The same Ram Caught in a Thicket appeared in the Bible as \na surrogate victim to replace Isaac, whose father Abraham was about \nto sacrifice him on the altar at Yahweh\'s command (Genesis 22:13). \nThe story marked a transition from ancient customs of human \nsacrifice to the classical rule of animal sacrifice, as shown also in the \nsubstitution of the ram of the Golden Fleece for the king\'s son in a \nBoeotian sacrifice to Zeus. 2 An older Midrashic version of the Abra- \nham-Isaac story said Abraham\'s hand was not stayed, the ram did not \nappear. Isaac was slaughtered, buried, and rose again on the third day. 3 \n\nRams were sacred in Israel as consorts of Rachel, the Holy Ewe, \nwhom the biblical narrative later married to Jacob, A reincarnated \nIsaac. Jews sacrificed the paschal lamb each year as a firstborn son of the \nram god who was identified with Yahweh. At one time the biblical \nGod wore ram\'s horns, later assigned instead to the devil. Joshua\'s \n\n\n\n841 \n\n\n\nRama priests used ram\'s horns to make victory magic (Joshua 6:4), showing \n\nRape that they were led by the divine ram in battle. \n\n1. Budge, G.E. 2, 64. 2.

One gets the impression that the Greeks \nthought women always had to be forced into sexual relationships, even \nwith gods. But the word translated "rape" usually meant seduction. \nTeiresias, who lived as both a man and a woman, announced his \ndiscovery that a woman\'s pleasure in sex was nine times that of a \nman. 1 \n\nTrue rape was not common in the ancient world. Like the males \nof all other mammalian species, the ancients believed sexual activity \nshould be initiated by the female. The modern conventional description \nof a rapist as an "animal" is a slur on the animal kingdom; animals do \nnot rape. Only man forces sexual attentions on an unwilling female. \n\nThe Bible tells of a Levite who gave up his concubine-wife to a \nmob to be gang-raped to death in order to save himself from \nmolestation, and then cut her to pieces. "All who saw it said, There was \nno such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel \ncame up out of the land of Egypt unto this day" (Judges 19:30). A war \nwas fought over the incident, showing that it was highly unusual. \n\nA change in the attitude toward rape was one of the contrasts \nbetween the ancient world and the medieval one in western Europe. \nThe Romans and Saxons punished rapists by death. Normans cut off a \nrapist\'s testicles and gouged his eyes out. 2 The gypsies\' Oriental \nheritage demanded the death penalty for a rapist. 3 Hindu law said a \nrapist must be killed, even if his victim was of the lowest caste, an \nUntouchable; and his soul should "never be pardoned. " 4 The Byzan- \ntine Code decreed that rapists must die and their property must be \ngiven to the victim, even if she was no better than a slave woman. 5 \n\nChristian laws changed the picture. Serfs\' wives, sisters, or daugh- \nters were always sexually available to their overlords under the new \n\n\n\n842 \n\n\n\nime. 6 Peasant brides were raped by the baron before being turned Rape \n\ner to their bridegrooms probably to be raped again. The Church \nmade it illegal for any wife to refuse sexual intercourse unless it was a ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nholy day when marital sex was prohibited. Therefore, marital rape \nwas encouraged. \n\nVictorian England almost achieved one of patriarchy\'s most \nsought-after goals: total male control of female sexuality. Until 1884 a \nwife could be jailed for trying to deny her husband his "conjugal rights." \nShe was as much a sexual slave as any inmate of an eastern harem. 7 \nForced to consent to frequent rape by husbands who neither knew nor \ncared about women\'s sexual enjoyment, 19th-century wives became \npredictably indifferent to the delights of the marriage bed, in such \nnumbers that medical authorities described women as "largely devoid \nof sexual pleasure." It was said in a standard marriage manual used for \ndecades, and translated into 1 2 languages: "Wives seldom seek the \ncloser embraces of their husbands. They are generally indifferent; often \nabsolutely averse. . . . God has made the passivity of the wife the \nprotection of her husband and a source of manifold blessing to their \nchildren." Having thanked God for a world of unaroused women, the \nauthor went on: "There can be little doubt that much marital indiffer- \nence upon the part of wives is due to chronic constipation, which is so \nprevalent among women. " 8 The implied assumption would be that \nGod foresightedly afflicted women with chronic constipation in \naddition to the other curses on Eve. \n\nSocieties retaining the idea of Goddess-worship seldom demon- \nstrate marital or extramarital rape; female sexuality is nearly always \nfully developed. Sadistic, violent sexual fantasies do not appear in the \nimagery of India. 9 The matriarchal Semai held it illegal for a man \neven to try to talk to a woman into sexual relations if she said no in the \nbeginning. 10 Anti-rape rules inspired warmer relationships, as G.B. \nShaw said: "The desire to give inspires no affection unless there is also \nthe power to withhold." n \n\nThe laws of Shaw\'s culture, however, were designed to deprive \nwomen of the power to withhold. Before 1653, any Englishman \ncould kidnap and rape a child heiress, after which the law viewed him as \nher legal husband. He was rewarded for rape with the acquisition of \nthe victim\'s property. In 1653 the law was changed not to help the \nvictim, but to cut the government in on the loot. A man could be \nimprisoned for raping a young girl for her money, but half the victim\'s \nestate was taken by the government. 12 \n\nVictorians never held men legally responsible for debauching \nadolescent girls, since the legal "age of consent" for females was \ntwelve. A child under the age of eight was not allowed to give evidence \nagainst a man who violated her, on the ground that she was too \nyoung to understand the legal oath. 13 Yet in the 16th century, authori- \nties set the "age of consent" at six years. 14 Raping children was a \ncommon enough pastime of Victorian men, who maintained that sexual \n\n\n\n843 \n\n\n\nRape intercourse with a virgin child was a sure cure for syphilis. As late as \n\nthe 1930s, the madam of a West End whorehouse advertised, "In my j \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ mB house you can gloat over the cries of the girls with the certainty that \nno one will hear them besides yourself." 1S \n\nVictorian pornography reflects an obsessive fascination for vio- \nlence and rape, often describing sexual partners as "adversaries," \nthough they were certainly not evenly matched. One male writer \nfantasized a female experience of defloration by a rapist who "quickly \nburied his tremendous instrument too far within me to leave me any \nchance of escape. He now paid no kind of attention to my sufferings, \nbut followed up his movements with fury, until the tender texture \naltogether gave way to his fierce tearing and rending, and one \nmerciless, violent thrust broke in and carried all before him, and sent it \nimbrued, reeking with blood of my virginity, up to its utmost length \nin my body. The piercing shriek I gave proclaimed that I felt it up to the \nvery quick; in short, his victory was complete." The same male writer \nmused complacently: "How magical is the influence of our sex over the \nfeelings of the softer one." 16 \n\nThe magic was not apparent to a modern rape victim who, \nnevertheless, displayed an almost catatonic acceptance of the victim\'s \nrole, in effect giving her attackers the right to abuse her: \n\nThey were just taking advantage of me because I was alone and available. \nThat\'s just the way men relate to women. If they \'re alone and available, \nwell, use them. Audit\'s nothing perverted. It\'s just their normal way of \nrelating to a woman. . . . \n\nAfter it was over, I was aware of pain and dirtiness in my body, and I \nwas hurt in my pride and confused about why they had raped me and \nwhy they were laughing at me and making fun of my body and taunting \nme. And I was also very sure that God was watching the whole thing \nand shaking his head and saying what a horrible person I was for allowing \nmyself to get raped. \' 7 \n\nStudies have shown that raped women often were reluctant to \nhurt their assailants, e.g. by gouging eyes or twisting testicles, even when \nthey had a chance. "Women often take the responsibility when men \ntreat them as prey. This isn\'t just an odd female quirk. The attitude is \ndeeply entrenched Women are taught to make themselves at- \ntractive to men. Those who don\'t are ignored by men or incur their \ndispleasure. But if they become victims of sexual assault, they are \nimmediately suspected of collusion. No man is ever guilty." 18 \n\nIn San Francisco in 1971, a gunpoint rapist was acquitted because \nhis unmarried victim admitted having a lover. Women picketers \nprotested the decision in vain, handing out leaflets which said: \n\nWhen a person is robbed, the robber is put on trial. When someone is \nmurdered, the murderer is tried. But when a woman is raped, it is the \nwoman and not the rapist who is put on trial. . . . If she can be shown to \nhave any sexual history, the rapist must be acquitted, for by their \ndefinition it is then no rape at all. For a woman to allow herself to be a sex- \\ \n\n\n\n844 \n\n\n\nual person, to enjoy her sexuality in her own way in her own time, is for Rape \n\nher to lose all protection from being forced to commit sexual acts with any \n\nman at any time. \' 9 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nSometimes the culture forces on men a pseudo-rapist stance vis- \na-vis women, where men in groups gang up on a woman verbally or \nsymbolically, to injure her sense of self. One young woman wrote: \n"When I first started to live in the city, I would walk by the construction \nworkers having lunch and hear all those horrible comments. I didn\'t \nquite know how to deal with it. I was embarrassed because I had breasts. \nI felt it was my fault for having them, and that of course I deserved to \nbe commented upon. Now I know that\'s not true. It\'s they who have to \nchange, not me." 20 A recent investigator wrote: \n\nThe virility mystique . . . predisposes men to rape. If women were physi- \ncally stronger than men, I do not believe there would be any instances \nof female raping male, because female sexual socialization encourages a \nwoman to integrate sex, affection, and love, and to be sensitive to what \nher partner wants. Of course, there are many women who deviate from \nthis pattern, just as there are men who have managed to reject their \nsocialization for virility. But cultural trends make these cases exceptional. \nIf our culture considered it masculine to be gentle and sensitive, to be \nresponsive to the needs of others, to abhor violence, domination, and \nexploitation, to want sex only within a meaningful relationship, to be \nattracted by personality and character rather than by physical appearance, \nto value lasting rather than casual relationships, then rape would indeed \nbe a deviant act. . . . \n\nIf lynching is the ultimate racist act, rape is the ultimate sexist act. It \nis an act of physical and psychic oppression. . . . [L] ike lynching, it is \ncowardly, and like lynching, it is used to keep individual women, as well as \nwomen as a caste, in their place. And finally, as with lynching, the rape \nvictim is blamed for provocation. \n\nRape is an abuse of power, and the increase in rape shows that men \nare increasingly unable to handle their excessive power over women. . . . \nEradicating rape requires getting rid of the power discrepancy between \nmen and women. 2 \' \n\nFrom the Inquisition\'s torturers, who usually raped their victims \nfirst, to Victorian doctors who attacked female genitals with leeches, \nmany kinds of rape could be traced to what has been called "the \nvirulent woman-hatred in fundamentalist Christianity." 22 Recent stud- \nies show that most rapists were professed members of a religious sect \nand learned to regard sex as evil, in the traditional Christian manner. 23 \nOne rapist said, "I\'ve always been brought up that sex was dirty, sex \nwas not to be practiced." Another said he was "confused about just what \nthe sex act was and how they went about it." Another was so naive he \ndidn\'t know where babies came from, and another was ignorant of the \nword "vagina," calling it \'Virginia" instead. 24 "Sex offenders as a \ngroup were extremely naive about sexual matters, felt inferior, had \nsuffered in childhood from anxiety and fears about sex . . . and had \nlacked accurate sex instruction." 25 \n\n\n\n845 \n\n\n\nRati \n\n\n\nIn some areas, the laws of both church and state actually encour- \naged rape until very recently. Up to 1978 in Italy, a rapist could go \nunpunished if his victim agreed to marry him. By a combination of \nviolation and coercion, it was quite possible for a man to force \nmarriage on a woman who had every reason to fear and hate him. And, \nsince patriarchal society in effect forbade women to hate men, \nespecially as wives, once again the victim would be blamed for her \nvictimization. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 2, 11. 2.

J There may have been a connection with the \nGreeks\' Erato, "Passionate One," the Muse of erotic poetry. 2 Images of \nRati displayed the overflowing sexuality and fertility admired in \nancient matriarchies: huge breasts, a pregnant belly, a mouth twisted to \none side and shaped like a vulva. Zimmer\'s description shows the \ntypical uneasiness of the western male in the presence of such exagger- \nated symbols of the Eternal Feminine: \n\nThe goddess of maternity and fertility . . . is indicating, with a traditional \ntwofold symbolic gesture, the two main functions of the female \nprinciple. One forearm lifts the breasts that nourish the creatures she \nbrings forth, while the other hand, placed at the lower abdomen, \nimmediately above the organ of generation, presses the ever-pregnant \nwomb. The sensual mouth, with its half-open lips and broadening gap \nat the left corner, has a voluptuous, dolorous trait, suggesting simulta- \nneously the delights of love and conception and the pangs and throes of \nbirth. The figure exhibits, frankly, all the innocent shamelessness of \narchaic mother figures, but in addition or so it seems the challeng- \ning, calm, watchful, and consciously exhibitionistic attitude of a curiously \ndemonic, suprahuman harlot. The hideous and grotesque features are \nsuffused with a sinister, devilish allure of sex. . . . \n\nThe image, though by no means isolated in the art of Bali, is one of \nits most challenging and meaningful specimens . . . rawly protesting, as \nit were, against the lofty doctrines of release and transcendent redeeming \nwisdom, which, in the forms of Buddhist and yogic asceticism, were the \nmost conspicuous and forceful products, in that period, of the masculine \nspirit. After milleniums of the struggle of the gurus to disengage man \nfrom the brutish thrall of the demonic powers of sheer nature, these \nunabated, unconquered, and unreconciled still were there.

Many forms of the Lord of Death were incarnate in a raven. \nChukchi shamans called their ancestral wizard-king Big Raven, he \nwho was ceremonially castrated and killed. 1 Danes spoke of a Valraven \nwho was Hel\'s king in the underworld. As a son and mate of the \nnether Goddess, he was sometimes personified as King Morvran, "Sea- \nRaven." 2 \n\nValkyries could take the form of ravens to drink the blood of slain \nwarriors, which is why Norse skalds called blood "the raven\'s drink." 3 \nLike a Valkyrie-psychopomp, a raven was supposed to perch on the \nshoulder of the Orphic initiate as he entered the temple for the \nceremony of mock death and rebirth. 4 According to the Mithraic \nMysteries, the initiate received the title of Raven when he attained \nthe first degree of enlightenment, which corresponded to ascent to \nheaven\'s lunar sphere, the domain of the Moon-goddess who re- \nceived and cared for the dead. 5 \n\nSo constant was the death-and-resurrection symbolism of the raven \nin Germanic tradition that the new Germanic hero of the Second \nComing, Emperor Frederick, was said to be guarded by ravens as he \nwaited, sleeping, in his underground sanctuary for the day of his \nreturn to earth. According to the Armenian version, the emperor still \nsleeps under a magic hill called Rock of the Raven. 6 In fairy tales, a \nraven is often the soul-bird who conducts the hero into mysterious \nunderground places and out again, or gives information concerning \nthe after-world. \n\n1.

In the role of \nFate-goddess, the Great Mother governed the Wheel of Becoming \n(Greek, kyklos geneseon) which meant the cycles of successive lives, \nlike the wheel of karma governed by Kali. 1 \n\nPatriarchal thinkers tended to deny the doctrine of reincarnation in \n\n\n\n847 \n\n\n\nReincarnation \n\n\n\nFirst Book of \n\nAdam and Eve One of \n\nthe legendary \napocrypha (works \nwritten in Greek \nfrom Jewish sources) \ngiving additional \ndetails or alternative \nversions of the \nGenesis myths. \n\n\n\nfavor of the one-way trip to heaven or hell after only one life on \nearth. They sought eternal stasis rather than cycles. Yet reincarnation \nwas the standard belief of all the ancient nations, with the patriarchal \nprinciple of eternal stasis appearing only as a late development. \n\nPythagoras believed in transmigration of souls from one body to \nanother: "The spirit wanders, comes now here, now there, and \noccupies whatever frame it pleases. From beasts it passes into human \nbodies, and from our bodies into beasts, but never perishes." 2 Plato \nhad the same idea. His Republic depicted Greek heroes in the under- \nworld choosing bodies for their next incarnation on earth. The rebirth \ndoctrine prevailed among cultured Greeks who had been initiated into \nthe Mysteries. Their idea was the same as the Tantric idea, which \npromised free choice of subsequent bodies to the Enlightened Ones in \nthe Intermediate State between death and the next life. 3 \n\nEven Jewish tradition retained traces of the reincarnation doctrine. \nIn the First Book of Adam and Eve, Adam offered God a sacrifice of \nhis own blood, saying, "Be favorable to me every time I die, and bring \nme to life." 4 Orthodox Jews made it a rule not to name a newborn \nchild after a living person, lest untimely transmission of the name-soul \nshould bring death to the elder. The rule stemmed from the ancient \nbelief that every infant possessed the soul of an ancestor in a new body. 5 \nThe Jewish belief that a woman could conceive by bathing in water \nused to wash a corpse clearly points to a belief in reincarnation. 6 Indeed, \nthe Talmud says Adam was reincarnated in the person of David, and \nthen again in the Messiah. 7 \n\nReincarnation was the general belief not only in the Orient but \nthroughout pagan Europe. Caesar said the druids taught this doctrine \nof cyclic rebirths. 8 It is still the prevailing opinion among "primitive" \npeoples who imagine their own souls to be temporary bits of the \nWorld Soul that animates all living things. The Poetic Edda demon- \nstrates a belief in the karmic wheel of reincarnations, from which one \nmay be released only by self-destruction. Brynhild\'s suicide insured that \n"born again she may never be." 9 Among the Eskimos as among \nancient Greeks and Hindus, cycles of reincarnation include all forms of \nlife. They say the Goddess of Animals looks after all creatures and \ndoesn\'t like to see too many of them killed, since they are of the same \nspiritual substance as human beings. "Life is endless," the shamans \nsay, "only we do not know in what form we shall reappear after \ndeath." 10 \n\nReincarnation was necessarily bound up with motherhood in all \nsocieties, since mothers were its agents and carriers. It was the mother \nof Lemminkainen, hero of the Kalevala, who gave him another life after \nhe was killed. 11 In northern India, dead infants were buried under the \nthreshold of the house, so their spirits might enter the bodies of mothers \nwho passed in and out and so be born again. 12 \n\nReincarnation seems to have been a secret tenet of some of the \nearly Christian churches, not explained to ordinary congregations but \n\n\n\n848 \n\n\n\nivealed in secret after the preliminary stages of initiation into an inner \n;roup of "elect" or "perfected" mystics. Later, the exoteric church \nrepudiated the doctrine of karmic rebirth. In 553 a.d. the Second \nCouncil of Constantinople laid down a decree: "Whosoever shall \nsupport the mythical doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul and the \nconsequent wonderful opinion of its return, let him be anathema." \nOrigen, once accounted a saint and a father of the church, taught the \ndoctrine of reincarnation; but three centuries after his death he was \nofficially excommunicated "on account of his beliefs." 13 \n\nThe concept of reincarnation made nonsense of the Christian \ndoctrine of reward and punishment after death. If all souls returned to \nthe same Cauldron of Regeneration, including animal souls mingling \nwith human ones, logically they were not differentiated for eternity \ninto "evil" and "good" souls. The West\'s traditional denial of soul-stuff \nto animals, and its insistence that man alone was immortal and stood \nat the pinnacle of all creation, led to abuses contributing to the present- \nday ecological crisis. At a symposium of theologians in California, \n1970, "virtually all the scholars agreed that the traditional Christian \nattitude toward nature has given sanction to exploitation of the \nenvironment by science and technology and thus contributed to air and \nwater pollution, overpopulation and other ecological threats." Lynn \nWhite wrote, "One of the causes of our present crisis is to be found in \nthe Judeo-Christian traditions . . . which speak of man\'s dominance \nover nature. ... By destroying pagan animism, Christianity made it \npossible to exploit nature in a mood of indifference to the feelings of \nnatural objects." M It is odd that even here, those living things with \nfeelings are called "objects." \n\nEastern opinions on reincarnation mitigated man\'s cruelty to his \nfellow creatures, at the price of attributing to them a psychic content \nindistinguishable from that of human beings. It is no great moral victory \nto refrain from killing a spider if one sincerely believes the spider \ncould contain the soul of one\'s grandmother. It might be more moral to \nrefrain from killing a spider simply because it is alive, and wishes to \nremain so; and all will to live deserves respect. \n\nPerhaps the best one could say for reincarnation was that it was not \nwasteful. Its soul-stuff was preserved and recycled. The Christian \ntheory was less tidy, with constant new creation of supposedly "immor- \ntal" souls, since the world began: a vast accumulation, still increasing \ndaily. In practice, however, many Christians secretly believed in some \nform of the forbidden reincarnation. Like Orphics, some even \nclaimed they could remember their former lives. The conspicuous \nabsence of proof for such claims only seems to strengthen the faith of \nthose who wish to believe. \n\nI. Bardo Thodol, lxvii. 2. Campbell, P.M., 293-94. 3.

At first \nhe was accounted a \nsaint, but three \ncenturies after his \ndeath he was declared \na heretic because of \nGnostic elements \nfound in his writings. \n\n\n\n849 \n\n\n\nReligion \n\n\n\nSir Richard Francis \n\nBurton (1821-1890) \nBritish traveler, \nconsul, orientalist, \ntranslator of The \nArabian Nights, author \nof more than 50 \nbooks on Indian, \nArabian, South \nAmerican and African \ncultures including \na book on the Mormons \nof Salt Lake City. \nBurton was one of the \nfirst Europeans to \nmake the pilgrimage to \nMecca and Medina; \nand with J.H. Speke, \none of the first to \ndiscover Lake \nTanganyika and the \nsources of the Nile. \n\n\n\nReligion \n\nLatin rehgio meant re-linking or reunion, a restoration of the umbili- \ncal bond between nature and man, or between the Mother Goddess and \nher son-consort, typified by human sexual union. The Sanskrit \nequivalent was yoga, which also meant linking or joining, root of the \nEnglish "yoke." 1 \n\nA need to re-establish the mother-child bond in symbol may have \nbeen the source of all religion, which Schleiermacher defined as an \ninfantile "feeling of absolute dependence." 2 Gaylin says "the helpless- \nness of infancy" is transmuted in religious imagery to "a plea for a \nsolution to the problem of survival." 3 Significantly, the mature, caretak- \ning figure even in patriarchal religious imagery was the female, not \nthe male. God nearly always had a baby stage, appearing in his Mother\'s \narms. But the Goddess, even in her virgin form, was full grown and \nmaternally capable. This curious fact may be based on the attitude of \nworshipper to deity as a child to parent, and the true biological parent \nrecognized by all mammals is the mother. Thus, even patriarchal \nreligions conceal the "strong unconscious trend towards mother- \nworship." 4 \n\nFreud defined religion as an attempt to control the mental world \n"by means of a world of wishes." Religious images are "fulfilments of \nthe oldest, strongest, most compelling wishes of mankind." 5 Apart from \nthe wish to control the Mother figure, and the wish not to die, the \ngods made in the image of men expressed a rather paltry, self-seeking \nseries of wishes obviously drawn from limited imagination. Santayana \nremarked, "It is pathetic to observe how lowly are the motives that \nreligion, even the highest, attributes to the deity, and from what a \nhard-pressed and bitter existence they have been drawn. To be given \nthe best morsel, to be remembered, to be praised, to be obeyed \nblindly and punctiliously these have been thought points of honor \nwith the gods." 6 Of course these were points of honor with men first. \nAs Sir Richard Francis Burton said, "The more I study religions, the \nmore I am convinced that man never worshipped anything but \nhimself." 7 \n\nBuddhist ascetics concurred, saying a man\'s self is "nearer to us \nthan anything else, indeed dearer than a son, dearer than wealth, \ndearer than all beside. Let a man worship the Self alone as dear, for if he \nworship the Self alone as dear, the object of his love will never \nperish." Children were of no interest to the male ascetics: "Realizing \nthe glory of the Self, the sages of old craved not sons nor daughters. \n\'What have we to do with sons and daughters,\' they asked, we who \nhave known the Self, we who have achieved the supreme goal of \nexistence?\' " 8 \n\nWith the advent of male gods, religions tended to become obses- \nsive about guilt and sin, worried about what the gods might punish as \nhubris, fearful of giving offense by a careless word or deed. In short, the \n\n\n\n850 \n\n\n\ngods behaved like not particularly loving fathers, or elder males Religion \n\nseeking to maintain ascendancy over younger ones. The Judeo-Chris- \n\ntian deity became one of the foremost examples of Oepidal hostility ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nin the world pantheon. He punished the whole human race for one sin \nof its remote ancestor, with a punishment so terrible that it would last \nforever in merciless agony. The fear of so irrational and vindictive a \ndeity drove a whole civilization into neurosis. Social evils that might \nhave been remedied were left unchecked, on the theory that all human \nbeings were sinful wretches who deserved to suffer especially wom- \nen, the primary sinners. Serfdom, slavery, legalized brutality, economic \noppression all were excused in the name of a vengeful God, whose \npriesthood insisted on his hostility toward humanity, to the point where \nunspeakable atrocities were committed to the greater glory of reli- \ngion. 9 Christian history shows that religion may follow a humane course \nin response to social trends; but it does not lead the way. \n\nWith its doctrine of inherited sin, for which no man could atone by \nhimself without the intercession of the Son whose death the Father \ncommanded, Christianity set out to formalize the hostile parent figure \nin its insistence that the only way to righteousness was to fear God. \nAccordingly, fathers of the church emphasized this point. Lactantius \nclaimed all religion depends on fear; Tertullian asked, "How are you \ngoing to love, unless you are afraid not to love?" ,0 The horror story of \nGod\'s hostility toward his wretched children was treated as a literal \nreality, not a psychological image. This "fiction of timeless truths has \ntaxed the ingenuity of even the ablest of rationalizers who seek by \nmeans of subtle taxonomic devices to fit embarrassing new discoveries \ninto the framework of the old beliefs." n As the old beliefs were \nproducts of primitive ignorance, their framework has had to be stretched \nto cover an immense body of fact that it was never meant to cover. \nThe fit is still poor: \n\nNo ethics and no religion can contain any wisdom that can transcend \nman \'s own knowledge about the immediate and future consequences \nof his own behavior. Every religion and every ethical system must \nrecognize that it might well be made obsolete by an extension of \nhuman knowledge in almost any area. . . . \n\nFar from any evidence of far-sighted and consistent leadership, the \nclergy has shown nothing other than all too human tendency to fill \ntheir sails with whatever winds of public opinion may blow, and always \nwith their vested interest firmly at the helm. \' 2 \n\nThe clergy\'s vested interest now dictates revision of traditional \nillusions to suit more modern thinking. Augstein says theologians now \nadmit that "Christianity has been on the wrong track for sixteen \nhundred years, ever since Constantine, that it has had a wrong concep- \ntion of God all that time and is only now in a position to disclose its \nsocial mores in short, that it must start all over again. But when \nreligion was powerful, it never wielded any positive influence on \n\n\n\n851 \n\n\n\nReligion \n\n\n\nRev. Kirsopp Lake \n\nBritish ecclesiastical \nhistorian, author of \nLandmarks in the \nHistory of Early \nChristianity, 1920. \n\n\n\nsocial mores; so why should it do so today, when it is a survival sinking \nout of sight?" " Churches have not shown any inclination to reform \nthemselves except when sales of their nonproduct decline to the danger \npoint, and few take much active interest in social issues. Farm worker \nRoberto Acuna spoke bitterly of his church\'s indifference: "I could tear \nthe churches apart. I never saw a priest out in the fields trying to help \n\npeople [I]t\'s always the church taking from the people." M \n\nJames Martineau, professor of moral philosophy at Manchester \nNew College, summed up the dilemma of conventional religion in \nThe Seat of Authority of Religion: \n\nChristianity . . . has been mainly evolved from that which is unhistorical \nand perishable in its sources; from what is unhistorical in its traditions, \nmythological in its preconceptions, and misapprehended in the oracles of \nits prophets. From the fable of Eden to the imagination of the last \ntrumpet, the whole story of the divine order of the world is dislocated and \ndeformed. . . . \n\nThe spreading alienation of the intellectual classes of European \nsociety from Christendom, and the detention of the rest in their \nspiritual culture at a level not much above that of the Salvation Army, are \nsocial phenomena which ought to bring home a very solemn appeal to \nthe consciences of ordinary churches. ,f \n\nSome scholars find it baffling that man seems unable to found \nan ethic or a philosophy on perceptions of reality, but instead must cling \nto crude myths even to the point of filling his own life and the lives \nof others with unnecessary horrors. 16 Among the worst of these is the \nreal violence with which man attacks the questioners or doubters of \nhis myths: as if to kill his own reasonable doubts before they rise up to \nthe surface of his mind and become fully conscious. \n\nTo purvey an unenlightened education, teaching myths as if they \nwere facts, is another abuse of cultural communication, inflicting on \nchildren a confusion between truth and fantasy that may haunt them all \ntheir lives and prevent them from developing clear thought on any \nsubject. It isn\'t always easy for a child to know where the real world \nstops and his own imagination begins. If adults can\'t help him draw \nthe line, because their own minds are muddled by an age-old ignorance, \nthe next generation will repeat the errors of centuries. \n\nReligions affect to purvey "higher Truth," but all too often their \ncapital-T Truth bears an uncanny resemblance to a capital-L Lie. One \ntheologian said the objective of religion is "to know the truth and to \nlive by it"; but the same theologian defined religion as "believing things \nthat do not seem to be so, and always it is believing what cannot be \nproved to be so." A less subtle seminarian once defined religion as "the \npower that enables us to believe what we know to be untrue." 17 No \nwonder the Rev. Kirsopp Lake lamented that a clergyman is "apt to \nhave a lower standard of intellectual honesty than would be tolerated \nin any other profession." A noted historian writes: "The churches have \nlong brought up the intellectual rear of our civilization, and . . . their \n\n\n\n852 \n\n\n\nI claims to spiritual leadership are still weakened by their engrained Religion \n\nI tendency to resist new knowledge and aspiration. Most are still \n\ndisposed to a dogmatic supernaturalism that saps the intellectual honesty ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nand courage essential for a responsible idealism." 18 \n\nIt is often taken for granted that religion helps to keep the ordinary \n\ncitizen honest, presumably through fear of divine punishment. This \n\nmay be a misapprehension: \n\nEvery survey ever undertaken of the composition of the criminal popula- \ntion reveals a percentage of the avowedly religious higher than a \nrandom sample of the population will show. . . . Little or no relationship \nwas found between the presence or absence, intensity, or kind of \nexpression of religious faith, and conduct or moral standard. Some of \nthose who were most skeptical, or who denied all need of faith or \nconcern with religious problems, were unimpeachable in behavior, kind \nand helpful to others, and of high integrity. . . . \n\nThe many attempts to find evidence that religion or its practice have \n[sic] desirable consequences in crime prevention have without excep- \ntion ended in failure . . . there seems to be no convincing evidence that \nconventional religion, of itself, has proved an effective antidote to \ncrime. \' 9 \n\nUnfortunately, in the western world religion has proved more \noften an instrument of oppression than a guide to more honest or more \ntolerant living. Churches generally supported the powerful at the \nexpense of the powerless. For example, the church helped even the \ncrudest monarchies in history by formulating and upholding the \ndoctrine of the divine right of kings. In the present century the world \nhas seen cardinals praying for the success of dictators. 20 \n\nThe common symbol of religious organization is "the shepherd \nand the herd he must tend . . . and at the bottom of it lies the childlike \nconcept that our elders run the world for our benefit." 21 Of course, the \nshepherd doesn\'t tend the herd for the benefit of the sheep. He tends \nthem for his own benefit. He makes his living from them. In some ways \nthe analogy is apt. Ecclesiastical "shepherds" in the past have resorted \nto every imaginable crime to increase their profits: land-grabbing, \nvandalism, false advertising, defamation of character, forgery, plagia- \nrism, even all-out war and murder, ever since Pope Leo the Great \nendorsed the death penalty for "erroneous beliefs." There is still a \ntendency among Christians to "assume that theirs is the only true \nreligion, and that their Christian duty is to convert the rest of the \nworld. The rest of the world, which happens to include the great \nmajority of mankind, still resents this assumption." 22 \n\nChristian elitism allowed theologians to "believe that they speak \nfor everyone when they lecture about things like guilt, love, sin, and \ngrace. This naivete allows them to make definitive statements about the \ntrue way in which all people should live and think about these \nmatters. Theologians are ignorant of what every anthropologist \nknows i.e, that the forms of our thought derive from the forms of \n\n\n\n853 \n\n\n\nRenenet our culture." It has been demonstrated often enough that women \n\nparticularly suffered from the suppression of their own natural reli- \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ gious imagery in favor of an imposed masculine, alien, hierarchical \nsystem. "For women to become intellectually responsible and cre- \native members of society, they have to outgrow Oedipal dependence on \npaternal authority whether that authority is embodied in a paternalis- \ntic husband, or father, or God." Feminists have shown "how important \nthe demise of Yahweh and Christ is to the intellectual independence \nof Western women. Freud was certain that Judaism and Christianity \nstunted the intellectual maturity of men. It is probable, however, that \nthese religions are even more damaging to the intellectual growth of \nwomen." 23 \n\nOne might hope that, if women again become free to create their \nown religion as they were in the distant past, it would be a religion \nless sullied by the profit motive, the cruelty, hostility, and Oedipal \njealousy that disfigures the religious images of men. One might hope, \nalso, that it would remain open to correction by new scientific discover- \nies, as Christianity has never been. Thomas Aquinas warned long ago \nthat the faith would become a matter of ridicule "if any Catholic, not \ngifted with the necessary scientific learning, presents as dogma what \nscientific scrutiny shows to be false." 24 Later churchmen forgot this \nadvice. In consequence they can offer no reason other than the \nchurch\'s decree at present to endorse such impossibilities as a virgin \nbirth, transubstantiation, resurrection of the flesh, and all the biblical \nmiracles. At the same time they must deny the very same impossibilities \nclaimed by Christianity\'s historical rivals, on equally credible (or \nincredible) grounds. \n\nIt seems the religions of the western world have reached a period \nof crisis and must dissolve and re-form according to new principles, \nperhaps more realistic and humanistic ones. \n\n1.

After death, men might \nsee her "face to face." A vision of the naked Goddess was vouchsafed to \nher sacred kings, who could draw back the veil of her temple, the \nhymen, pierce her virginity and die in their mating, to become gods. \nBut, as the Goddess said on her temple at Sais, "No mortal has yet \nbeen able to lift the veil which covers me." 2 Those who saw her \nunveiled were no longer mortal. \n\nIn time, the word revelation was applied to every religious vision \nor opinion.

Literature of this kind was \n\n\n\n855 \n\n\n\nRhadamanthys plentiful in the first few centuries a.d., and it still occurred a thousand \n\nRhea years later in European pagan traditions, e.g. the very similar Voluspa \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ (Sybil\'s Vision) of the Scandinavian version of doomsday. \n\n1.

The other two were Sarpedon and \nMinos. \n\nRhadamanthys was said to have been so wise and just that in the \nunderworld he was made a judge of the dead, like the similar bull- \nking Yama in India. Some myths said when Rhadamanthys was installed \nin the paradise of the Elysian Fields he married Alcmene, "Moon- \npower," the virgin mother of Heracles. 1 Thus he was another form of \nthe Moon-bull king, like Zeus himself as consort of the Moon-cow \nEuropa a son identified with his divine father, like all other versions of \nthe Lord of Death. \n\n1. Graves, G.M. 1,294. \n\n\n\nRhea \n\nCretan name of the Aegean Universal Mother or Great Goddess, \nwho had no consort and ruled supreme before the coming of patriarchal \nHellenic invaders. Rhea was the archetypal Triple Goddess, with \nseveral titles suggesting her separate functions: she was Britomartis the \nSweet Virgin, and Dictynna the Lawgiving Mother of Mount Dicte, \nand Aegea the foundress of Aegean civilizations. 1 Another of her names \nwas Coronis, both a carrion crow (death-goddess) and a virgin mother \n(life-goddess) of the great hero of healing, Asclepius, whose Titan cult \nthe Hellenic Zeus angrily destroyed. \n\nRhea was not restricted to the Aegean area. Among ancient tribes \nof southern Russia she was Rha, the Red One, another version of \nKali as Mother Time clothed in her garment of blood when she \ndevoured all the gods, her offspring. 2 The same Mother Time \nbecame the Celtic Goddess Rhiannon, who also devoured her own \nchildren one by one. 3 This image of the cannibal mother was typical \neverywhere of the Goddess as Time, who consumes what she brings \nforth; or as Earth, who does the same. When Rhea was given a \nconsort in Hellenic myth, he was called Kronus or Chronos, "Father \nTime," who devoured his own children, in imitation of Rhea\'s earlier \nactivity. He also castrated and killed his own father, the Heaven-god \nUranus; and he in turn was threatened by his own son, Zeus. 4 These \nmyths reflect the primitive succession of sacred kings castrated and killed \nby their supplanters. (See Kingship.) It was originally Rhea Kronia, \n\n\n\n856 \n\n\n\nMother Time, who wielded the castrating moon-sickle or scythe, a Rhinemaidens \n\nScythian weapon, the instrument with which the Heavenly Father \n\nvas "reaped." Rhea herself was the Grim Reaper. \n\nPre-Roman Latium knew her as Rhea Silvia, "Rhea of the \n\nWoodland," an early form of the Moon-goddess Diana, called the \n\nirst Vestal Virgin and the mother of Romulus and Remus. Under the \n\nrule of Rhea Silvia, the Vestal Virgins were neither celibate nuns, nor \n\nservants of the state, as they became in later ages. They were choosers \n\nand deposers of the early Latin kings, a college oimatronae who \n\nruled the rulers and took no husbands. Consequently all their children \n\nwere begotten by "gods," not by men, as were the children of Rhea \n\nSilvia herself. Once born, Rhea\'s children were cared for by Acca \nLarentia, a "holy harlot" or high priestess who also mothered all the \nancestral spirits (lares) of Rome. See Akka. \n\nHellenic myth assimilated Rhea as both mother and wife of the \nGreat God Zeus. Zeus "raped" his mother Rhea because she forbade \nhim to make a monogamous marriage (her own people had practiced \ngroup marriage). Then again, Zeus "raped" his sister-bride Hera, \nRhea\'s daughter, alter ego, and virgin phase, whose name was really the \nsame as Rhea\'s He Era, the Earth. 5 \n\nHaving forced Rhea-Hera to marry him, Zeus became a symbol of \nGreek wife-abuse. The Mother and Father of the Olympian gods \ndespised one another, constantly bickered and argued; mythographers \nalways carefully described Hera\'s hostile "jealousy" of Zeus\'s many \nimpregnations of mortal virgins to provide the earth with god-begotten \nheroes. To spite her twin-brother-son-husband, Rhea-Hera returned \nto her ancient birth-magic and parthenogenetically conceived and bore \nthe serpent god Python just as under the archaic title of Eurynome \nshe had created the world alone and given birth to the serpent god \nOphion. \n\nAnother name for Rhea was Pandora, "the All-giver," which \nHesiod converted into an Eve-like giver of disasters to mankind, \nthrough her excessive curiosity. 6 The myth had its origin in the idea that \nthe Goddess did indeed give all kinds of fate, death as well as birth, \nsuffering as well as joy, in her endless time-cycles. \n\nI, Lurousse, 85-86. 2.

Since the Nibelungs were "shades," or spirits of the dead, \nthe Ring symbolized the karmic wheel and the Rhinemaidens were \nkeepers of the dead who were consigned to water, like aquatic Valkyries. \nThey resembled eastern Vilas and Homeric Sirens; hearing their \nsweet songs could mean death to men. In antiquity, such songs were \n\n\n\n857 \n\n\n\nRobin \n\n\n\nsung by priestesses in connection with sending a corpse to the Water- \nmother by way of the funerary boat. \n\n\n\nRobin was Saracenic, \nfrom Rah-bin, "a seer," \ncognate with the \nSemitic rabba, "lord," \nreb or rabbi, a priest. \nRobin\'s cult penetrated \nnorthern Europe \nfrom roots in Moorish \nSpain. 7 The Iberian \npeninsula was not \nChristianized until \nthe overthrow of its \nArab governors in \nthe 11th century. Like \nScandinavia in the \nsame period, it was a \nfount of pagan ideas \nand practices. \n\n\n\nRobin \n\nGod of the Witches, with numerous variations: Robin Goodfellow, \nRobin son of Art, Robin the Bobbin, Robin Hood, or Robin Red- \nbreast the last apparently derived from memories of the Norman \nsacred king with blood-runes or gens-odd carved in the flesh of his \nbreast on his "red-letter day" (see Runes). As Lord of the Hunt and \na dying god he became the slain Cock Robin, whose executioner in the \nnursery rhyme did him in "with my wee bow and arrow" a Saxon \nversion of the Celtic Cu Chulainn who died at Mag Muirthemne \nbound to the sacred pillar and riddled with arrows. 1 \n\nThe red-breasted bird of spring was Cock Robin\'s soul; the red was \nhis blood, shed by a pagan sacrifice, though a pseudo-Christian \nlegend tried to explain it in a different way. A robin tried to pluck away \nthe thorns from Christ\'s crown, but only succeeded in tearing its own \nbreast, so all robins had red breasts thereafter. 2 This fable failed to \nremove the curse of Cock Robin in the opinion of Christian authori- \nties who knew quite well that he was a phallic god. \n\nIn Cornwall, Robin meant a cock in the other sense: a penis. His \nsurname Hood, or Hud, referred to the symbolic pine log, planted in \nMother Earth as a sacred pillar. A pamphlet of 1639 showed Robin as a \nhorned, hoofed, ithyphallic satyr, leading witches\' revels in the \ncompany of a black dog and an owl. 3 \n\nRobin Hood, Wizard of the Greenwood, was a real person or \npersons leading Sherwood Forest covens in the early 14th century, \nwith a wife or paramour taking the role of the Goddess Maerin, or \nMarian, or Mari-Anna, the Saxon wudu-maer, literally the Mary or \nthe Mother of the Grove. Great sacramental feasts in honor of Robin \nand his lady were remembered in popular rhymes nearly three \ncenturies later, when he was "Robin the Bobbin, the big-bellied Ben, \nwho ate more meat than fourscore men." 4 \n\nFamily names can be found dating back to the "greenwood \nmarriages" performed by heathen shamans, symbolized by the rene- \ngade Friar Tuck. Morrises and Morrisons descended from orgiastic \nMorris-dancers, also called Marian\'s morrice-men. 5 Like Robin (or \nRobinson), Morris dancers\' May Day rites came from Moorish Spain. \nThe original word was morisco, "Moorish." 6 \n\nThe common folk of England liked Robin, which is why they \ncalled him Goodfellow, or Puck, which descended from a word for \n"God." He was supposed to right the wrongs inflicted on the peasants \nby the church. He stole the treasures of the rich clergy and nobles \nand bestowed them on the poor. By force of arms he maintained a \nheathen preserve in the wildwood, a sanctuary for heretics and others \n\n\n\n858 \n\n\n\npersecuted by the church. Popular legend said Robin was born of a Roch, Saint \n\nvirgin impregnated by Oberon, King of the Fairies. He traveled to Romance \n\nfairyland, and was shown "many secrets which he never did open to the ^^m^mm^^^^m^ \nworld." 8 \n\nLike the Greeks\' Pan, Robin defended unspoiled land against the \nencroachment of towns. In country districts, each village set aside a \nplot of raw woodland, which was not to be disturbed, because it \nbelonged to The Goodfellow, or the Good Man. 9 Elders of the \nScottish church in 1 594 exerted their utmost influence to abolish this \nGoodfellow\'s Croft, which they called the devil\'s acre, claiming it \ngave "great offence." 10 \n\nMystery plays of the 1 6th century still continued to celebrate \nRobin, Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, Little John, and the other heathen \nheroes. A Churchwardens Account Book lists the prices of costumes for \nRobin and Marian as King and Queen of the May. The lady \nimpersonating Marian wore a crown, a purple coif, a blue surcoat, a \nyellow skirt, and red sleeves. 11 In such a way did the church ingest \npagan ceremonials by sponsorship, and eventually deprive them of \nserious meaning. \n\nI.

Earlier \nrhyme-makers were priests of the Goddess, who gave them the gift of \ninspiration from her magic cauldron, or Holy Grail. 1 A poet was like a \nseer or wizard, able to deal in "words of power," to create by the charms \nof speech, a blessing of the Muse. Medieval poets were worshippers \nof Art and Woman, founders of the cult of courtly love, singers of \nmansongr, the "woman-songs" beloved by the Goddess; and they \nwere mockers of the church. \n\nPoets seem to have regarded themselves as a dispossessed priest- \nhood of the Goddess Love (Minne), who inspired the church\'s \n\n\n\n859 \n\n\n\nRomance \n\n\n\nFrithiof s saga \n\nSwedish national poem \ncomposed by Esias \nTegner (1782-1846), \nbased on an Old \nIcelandic saga. \n\n\n\nChansons de gestes \n\nOld French epic \npoetry of the 11th to \n13th centuries. \n\n\n\nhostility. Before the 13th century, poets were denied Christian commu- \nnion, and denounced by churchmen as "ministers of Satan." Later, \nthey won acceptance by using biblical and theological motifs in their \nsongs, but romantic poetry remained suspiciously heretical. 2 \n\nOld romances depicted the clergy as rude, brutish fellows who \nmistreated delicate ladies, and even displayed sadistic behavior toward \ntheir own brethren. 3 The pagan gods were credited with warmer \npersonalities. Frithiof \'s saga suggested that, though Christ despised \nlovers, the god Balder did not. Lovers could meet in the temples of \nBalder, "the pious god," because "Is not his love for Nanna part of \nhis own nature, pure and warm? " Romantic heroes generally avoided \nthe Christian paradise and went to the earthly one, governed by the \nGoddess Morgan, or the Fairy Queen. 4 \n\nAccording to the Lay of Gudrun, the poet had more magic power \nthan any priest. Like the poet-savior Orpheus, he could charm birds \nand beasts with his music, and even raise the dead. His songs were \nbetter liked than clerical sermons: \n\nWhate\'er he might be singing, to no one seemed it long; \nForgotten in the minster were priest and choral song, \nChurch bells no longer sounded so sweetly as before, \nAnd every one who heard him longed for the minstrel sore. s \n\nMinstrels\' ballads have been praised as works that seem "to have \nlooked deepest into the human heart," excluding their occasional \nChristian moralizing which is always "manifestly a later addition." \nSteenstrup calls attention "to what small degree the ecclesiastical, or the \nstrictly Catholic, element . . . gets leave to appear. . . . [T]he religious, \nthe ecclesiastical, the Catholic element has been clapped on later, and \n... it is a disturbing and jarring force." 6 The bards invoked not God but \nErda Mother Earth and the Goddess Minne, whose name was a \nsynonym for Love. 7 \n\nTo churchmen, love was "nothing." To play at a game of chance \n"for love" was to play for nothing. 8 The expression "for love or \nmoney" began with this distinction between pagan and Christian \nmotivations. The troubadours and minnesingers acted for Minne- \ndienst, the "service of love." 9 Of course, donations were always \nacceptable. \n\nThe cult of Love rarely included marriage, which was usually \narranged by the couple\'s elders, for economic reasons. Ladies of the \nCourts of Love in southern France said true love couldn\'t exist between \nmarried people. True love could exist only between a lady and her \nchosen knight, who was expected to prove "gallantry" in combat before \nhe could be a "gallant," or lover. Ladies told their suitors, "It is \n\nnecessary that for love of me you should do deeds of chivalry I will \n\ngive you all my love as soon as I have seen you fight your first joust." \nChansons de gestes advised warriors to strike their enemies squarely in \\ \nthe bowels, so as to win the love of "the most beautiful ladies of the \ncourt." 10 \n\n\n\nS60 \n\n\n\nThis was a curiously mammalian-biological system, in which \nwomen watched men in combat and rewarded the winners with \nsexual favors. Bishop Jacques of Vitry complained that knights fought in \ntournaments only to gain "the favors of the shameless women whose \ntokens they wear." The monk Gildas described the barbarian aristocracy \nas "addicted to vice, adulterous, and enemies of God." u \n\nOld ballads and romances depict a society in which men constantly \nshowed off to excite women\'s admiration, almost like male birds and \nbeasts displaying themselves to females. Norse skalds said everything \nmen did was to impress the ladies. When women were watching, \nthey spurred their horses to go faster, so "readily will look the ladies and \nlasses, as we are passing." 12 Geoffrey of Monmouth said the noble \nwomen were celebrated for their wit, and "esteemed none worthy of \ntheir love, but such as had given proof of their valor in three several \nbattles." 13 \n\nThere arose a corollary belief that no man could fight well unless \ninspired by the promise of his lady-love. Tristan said a man couldn\'t \nbe a warrior unless he was a lover. Lancelot became invincible only \nbecause Elaine gave him her sexual-symbolic love-token, a red silk \nsleeve as "sheath" for his "sword." Minnesinger Wolfram von Eschen- \nbach wrote of the love-trance that made a knight invincible, like a \nberserker. Wolfram\'s Parsifal asserted that for every kind of spiritual aid, \nincluding courage in battle, "it is better to trust a woman than \nGod." 14 \n\nThis Germanic Parsifal incorporated no Christian ceremony but \nwas written as if the church didn\'t exist. Parsifal\'s prayers were \naddressed to his lady, who magically protected him in battle and gave \nhim success as if she were a sacred agent of the ancient Lady of \nVictory. He fought in a love-trance of communion with her spirit, \nwhich made him virtually superhuman. 15 \n\nThis pagan knight fought his own alter ego, a Christian knight who \nfell back before the onslaught of the "heathen man" made invincible \nby his lady\'s love. "The heathen never wearied of love; his heart, \ntherefore, was great in combat." When he cried the name of his \nqueen\'s dwelling place, "his battle strength increased." 16 \n\nFor a while, certain sects of warriors undertook to defend the \nbeleaguered rights of women, in the name of the Goddess. From this \nperiod dated romantic stories of knights who rescued "castles of \nwomen" from robber barons who had seized their property. About the \n12th century, when the church began to arm its laws with the teeth of \nthe Inquisition, emphasis shifted from defense of women to defense of \nthe church. Sir Parsifal, or Perceval, presented a typical example of \nthe pagan hero who finally turned Christian and renounced women. \n\nAt first he was a champion of Love; but later he was "purified," \nand described by an ecclesiastical writer as "one of the men of the \nworld at that time which most believed in our Lord Jesus Christ, for in \nthose days there were but few folks who believed in God perfectly." \nPerceval set out to rescue "a gentlewoman which is disherited," but \n\n\n\nRomance \n\n\n\nWolfram von \nEschenbach Highly \ninfluential 13th- \ncentury author of such \npoetic epics as \nWillehalm, Titurel, \nParzival, and various \nTagelieder. \n\n\n\n861 \n\n\n\nRomance \n\n\n\nJohann Huizinga \n(1872-1945) Dutch \nhistorian, author of \nThe Waning of the \nMiddle Ages (1924), \nprofessor of history at \nGroningen and \nLeiden University until \nhe was arrested by \nthe Nazis in 1942. \n\n\n\nGuilhem \n\nMontanhagol Provencal \ntroubadour who took \nthe lead in raising \nideals of romantic love \nin Renaissance \npoetry. \n\n\n\nchanged his allegiance in mid-adventure, and renounced her as a \nseductress and witch. 17 \n\nRomantic literature reveals continual conflict between the min- \nstrel\'s love-oriented philosophy and the church\'s anti-love attitude. \nChurchmen said lovers became "vile" by forgetting God and making \nthe beloved woman a divinity. One priest said the bards "sinfully love \nwomen, whom they make into deities," and this was exactly the same as \nloving Satan. 18 Professor Huizinga noted that "from the side of \nreligion, maledictions were poured upon love in all its aspects." Yet the \npoets insisted that "Love was a divine visitation, quelling mere animal \nlust. . . . The lover, whose heart was rendered gentle by the discipline of \nhis lady, was initiate to a sphere of exalted realizations that no one \nwho had experienced such could possibly identify (as the church \nidentified them) with sin." 19 \n\nModern scholars have struggled to define the later stages of the \ncourtly-love movement, when the Meistersinger school was founded \nby men with the title of Frauenlob, "Lover of Women." The obvious \nspirituality of the movement led some to interpret it as a sentimental \nasceticism inspired by adoration of the virgin Mary. Yet some of the \nminstrels\' poetry was intensely even grossly erotic, focused on a \nreal female body, not an ethereal vision. Scholars failed to understand \nthis combination of spirituality and carnality because they failed to \ndiscover its historical root: the penetration of Europe by yet another \nwave of Tantric sex-worship. \n\nThe most mysterious element in courtly love was the secret \ntechnique of lovemaking known as drudaria, druerie, or karezza. It \ncan only have been a western version of Tantric maithuna, the sacra- \nment of coitus reservatus. This alone can explain its blend of erotic \nand spiritual ecstasy. Significantly, one of the heroes of courtly love \nmost revered as a model for poets was Tristan, who had reversed his \nname and called himself Tantris for the secret understanding of his lady- \nlove. 20 See Tantrism. \n\nThe poets kept their secret but obliquely referred to it when \ndefending themselves against charges of lechery. They claimed their \naim was not selfish pleasure but only gratification of the lady. Montan- \nhagol wrote, "A lover should on no account desire what would \ndishonor his lady-love," probably meaning an unwelcome pregnancy. \n"Desire never had any power over me to make me wish her to whom \nI have given myself aught that should not be. I would not reckon that a \npleasure which might debase her." Another poet said, "A true lover \nmust seek the interest of his beloved a hundred times more than his \nown." 21 \n\nThe poets were angered by certain ignorant men who copied \ncourtly-love behavior without understanding its basis. Men who \npursued women for their own sexual satisfaction were regarded as \nvulgar boors who "confounded everything by their behavior, which is \nno better than that of dogs." Men who didn\'t understand the true \n\n\n\n862 \n\n\n\ninitiation of love "adopted other maxims, which bring about shame." \nMarcabru said scornfully, "If they call that drudaria, they lie." Arnaud \nDaniel claimed to have renounced the love of wealthy women, who \nknew only pleasures of the shameful sort. "From such love as moves me \nare debarred those disloyal seekers of women who destroy courtli- \nness." 22 Courtliness was synonymous with Minnedienst, the service of \nwomen who knew how to be served. 25 \n\nWhere did the bards learn of maithuna? Probably from several \nsources. The gypsies practiced it, and gypsies infiltrated Europe from \nat least the 1 1th century on. 24 Even more influential was the Moorish- \nSaracen tradition emanating from Spain and the Middle East after \nthe crusades. Yoni-worship was preserved by such sects as the Sufis, \nwhose "Sufi Way" involved a sexual initiation by a fravashi, an occult \nlove-priestess like the Tantric shakti. Sufi sages taught that a man can \nfind spiritual fulfillment only in love, realizing Woman as "a ray of \ndeity." The word Sufi contained "in enciphered form, the concept of \nLove." Deciphered, it reduced by the Arabic numerological system \nto three letters: FUQ, meaning "that which is transcendent." 25 \n\nUnder the same language system, the title of a singer was Ta Ra B, \nwhich picked up the Spanish suffix -ador and became "troubadour." \nThus the troubadours\' worship of Love was a synthesis of pagan and \nOriental themes, founded on the idea of Woman as the true source \nof benevolence. Troubadour Bernard de Ventadorn wrote to his be- \nloved: "Noble lady, nothing do I ask of thee but that thou shouldst \ntake me for thy servant. I would serve as one serves a good lord, \nwhatever reward I might gain. Behold, I am at thy command: sincere \nand humble, gay and courteous. Neither bear nor lion art thou, to kill \nme, as I here to thee surrender." 26 Gentleness and sensuality reigned \ntogether in the mythical fairyland visited by Aucassin, a French roman- \ntic hero based on the Arabic "sultan of love," Al-Kasim. 27 \n\nMinnesingers worshipped their Goddess Minne as Love, but \nmocked the syncretism of Christian dogmas. Gottfried von Strassburg \nwrote: "The very virtuous Christ is as yielding as a wind-blown sleeve; \nhe adapts himself and goes along whatever way he is pressed, as \nreadily and easily as anyone could ask." 28 Wolfram von Eschenbach \nparodied the pope as a eunuch named Clinschor ("Clergyman") who \noffered his services to the devil. 29 Walther von der Vogelweide repri- \nmanded the clergy for their condemnation of love: \n\nWhoever says that Love is sin, \n\nLet him consider first and well: \n\nRight many virtues lodge therein \n\nWith which we all, by rights, should dwell. * \n\nMinnesinger Konrad of Megenburg wrote a scathing satire \nwhich he presented in the form of a debate between Lady Church \n(Mary-Ecclesia) and her servants, the clergy, who only pretended to \nserve her, but actually served her rival, Lady Avarice-and- Vainglory. \n\n\n\nRomance \n\n\n\nMarcabru, or \nMarcabrun One of the \nearliest Provencal \ntroubadours, of whose \nwork about 40 pieces \nsurvive, dated ca. 1135- \n1148. \n\n\n\nGottfried von \nStrassburg One of the \ngreatest medieval \nGerman poets, author \nof the epic Tristan \nund Isolde (early Bth \ncentury) and many \n, lyric poems. \n\nWalther von der \nVogelweide (ca. 1170- \n1230) Great German \nlyric poet, self-described \nas a Minnesinger, \nauthor of many love \npoems, protege of \nseveral Swabian and \nThuringian princes. \n\nKonrad von \nMegenburg German \nanti-papal imperialist \nscholar, author of \nPlanctus Ecclesie in \nGermaniam (1337) and \nDe translatione \nRomani Imperii (1354). \n\n\n\n863 \n\n\n\nRomulus and Remus Lady Church denounced her servants in most unladylike terms and \n\ncalled their real mistress " a whore, a wretched nurse of vice, a \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ superlative evil, a hypocrite." 31 \n\nOut of the courtly-love movement came one of the oddest of \nChristian pseudo-saints: St. Dymphna, a corruption of the romantic \npoet\'s name for his lady-love, madonna or ma dompna, "my mistress, \nmy lady." As an erstwhile patron of the moon-madness that sent the \npoet into his love-trance, she is still advertised today as a healer of \n"emotional distress." 32 \n\nLanguage and metaphors of romance in general point to disguised \nheretical allegories, which also survived in folklore and pagan custom, \ndrama, children\'s games, and witchcraft. \n\n1.

See Motherhood. \n\nRomulus himself was a patriarchal invention based on an ancient \nfeminine clan name: the Etruscan gens Romulia, the real founders of \nRome. 5 \n\n1 . Lamusse, 315. 2.

Actually, \nChristians copied the rosary from eastern pagans. Its real origin was \nthe Hindu japamak, "rose-chaplet," called the Rosary of the Mantras \nworn by Kali Ma. Its alternately red and white beads symbolized her \nMother and Virgin forms (see Gunas). The Rosary Upanishad said the \nsounds of her mantras were white, the bead-touchings were red. 1 \nArab poets viewed both white and red roses as emblems of the female \nprinciple, and called their rosaries wardija, "rose-garden." The same \nword in Latin, rosarium, described early rosaries associated solely with \nthe cult of the virgin Mary up to the 14th century. The Litany of \nLoreto calls Mary "Queen of the Most Holy Rosary." The German \nterm Rosenkranz, "rose- wreath," was sometimes shortened to Kranz- \nlein, "little wreath," a symbol of virginity or "flower of maidenhead." 2 \nIn the east, the flower-wreath represented sacred marriage, circling \nthe "head" of the phallic god. 3 \n\nLike a portable prayer-wheel, the rosary was used everywhere to \ncount repetitive prayers or mantras. Constant repetition of such \nverbal charms was believed to bring about blissful after-life, automatic- \nally. The Book of the Dead said the spoken formula of the rosary (in \nEgypt hung with an image of Horus) was "a protection upon earth, and \nit will secure for the deceased the affection of men, gods, and the \nSpirit-souls which are perfect. Moreover it acteth as a spell in Khert- \nNeter, but it must be recited by thee on behalf of the Osiris Ra, \nregularly and continually millions of times." 4 \n\nEarly Christians at first rejected rosaries and denied the efficacy of \nconstantly repeated prayers counted on the beads. Jesus said, "When \nye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that \nthey shall be heard for their much speaking" (Matthew 6:7). Despite \nthis Gospel directive, however, Christians eventually adopted the hea- \nthen custom of "vain repetitions" along with the heathen rose-wreath \n\n\n\nUpanishads Buddhist \nscriptures representing \nthe final stage in Vedic \nthought, dealing with \nthe philosophy known \nas Vedanta. The Katha \nUpanishad discusses \ntransmigration of souls, \nthe nature of eternal \nlife, the doctrine of \nmaya, and an account \nof a visit to Yama, Lord \nof the Dead. \n\nBook of the Dead \n\nCommon name for the \ncollection of \nEgyptian funerary \npapyri written \nbetween 1500 and 1350 \nB.C., including \nVignettes, Hymns, \nChapters, and \ndescriptive Rubrics. \nAmong the best- \npreserved, and most \ntypical, copies of the \nTheban Recension of \nthe Book of the \nDead is the much- \nstudied Papyrus of \nAni. \n\n\n\n865 \n\n\n\nitself, relating both to their own version of the Great Mother just as the \nHindus related them to Kali Ma. To this day, the user of the rosary \nappeals most often to Mary, imploring her to be present at his death, \njust as the Tantric sages implored Kali-Shakti. \n\nAssociation of the rosary with death is still found in the archaic \nreligion of Tibet, where rosaries sometimes had beads made of \nhuman skull bone, recalling the rosary of skulls worn by Kali the \nDestroyer. In a remarkable parallel, Christian rosaries were some- \ntimes made of tiny skulls carved from bone or ivory. Many eastern \nrosaries had a retaining bead formed like a vase, said to give birth to \nthe other beads. In the west, both the pagan Goddess and the virgin \nMary the primary object of rosary worship were known as the \nHoly Vase. 5 \n\nMohammedan rosaries usually contained 99 beads, one for each ol \n\nAllah\'s miracle-working names (see Name). Smaller rosaries were \n\nmade of 33 beads, with 3 groups of 1 1 set apart by markers, probably in \n\nimitation of the Vedic tradition of 33 gods divided into 3 companies \n\nof 1 1 each. 6 Arabs sometimes called the rosary Gulistan, the Rose \n\nGarden, which was also the title of a mystical work by Sufi poet Saadi \n\nof Shiraz, a Goddess-worshipper of the 13th century a.d. Europe\'s \n\nheraldic "gules," meaning red, came from the Arabic word for \n\n"rose." 7 \n\nl.Wilkins, 44, 194,201. 2. Wilkins, 40, 42, 151. 3. Larousse, 335. \n\n4. Book of the Dead, 567. 5.

Shah, 98. \n\n\n\nRose \n\nThe rosary was an instrument of worship of the Rose, which ancient \nRome knew as the Flower of Venus, and the badge of her sacred \nprostitutes. 1 Things spoken "under the rose" (sub rosa) were part of \nVenus\'s sexual mysteries, not to be revealed to the uninitiated. 2 The red \nrose represented full-blown maternal sexuality; the white rose or lily \nwas a sign of the Virgin Goddess. Christians transferred both of these \\ \nsymbolic flowers to the virgin Mary and called her the Holy Rose. \n\nRose windows in Gothic cathedrals faced west, the direction of the \nmatriarchal paradise, and were primarily dedicated to Mary as the \nfemale symbol opposing the male cross in the eastern apse. At Chartres, \nthe window called Rose of France showed "in its center the Virgin in \n\nher majesty Round her in a circle, are twelve medallions; four \n\ncontaining doves; four six-winged angels or Thrones; four angels of a \nlower order, but all symbolizing the gifts and endowments of the Queen \nof Heaven." Beneath, the Marian number of five windows centered \non Mary\'s mother, "the greatest central figure, the tallest and most \ncommanding in the whole church." 3 \n\nFive was the Marian number because it was the number of petals! \nin the rose, and also in the apple blossom another virginity-symbol \n\n\n\n866 \n\n\n\ngiving rise to the five lobes of the mature apple, the corresponding Rose \n\nsymbol of motherhood, fruition, regeneration, and eternal life. Five was \n\nconsidered "proper to Marian devotion" because Rose-Mary was the ^^^mm^^mi^^^m \n\nreincarnation of Apple-Eve. Christian mystical art showed apples and \n\nroses growing together on the Tree of Life in Mary\'s "enclosed garden" \n\nof virginity. \n\nThe fivefold rose and apple were also related to numerous pre- \nChristian images of the Goddess, the witches\' pentacle, the \nfive-pointed Star of Ishtar, and the Egyptian symbol of the uterine \nunderworld and cyclic rebirth. Mysteries of the Rose belonged to \nAphrodite, according to the poet Nossis: "Anyone the Cyprian does not \nlove, knows not what flowers her roses are." Aphrodite was repre- \nsented by a Rose-Mary plant, named for her as rosmarina, the Dew of \nthe Sea. 4 \n\nIn the great age of cathedral-building, when Mary was worshipped \nas a Goddess in her "Palaces of the Queen of Heaven" or Notre- \nDarnes, she was often addressed as the Rose, Rose-bush, Rose-garland, \nRose-garden, Wreath of Roses, Mystic Rose, or Queen of the Most \nHoly Rose-garden. 5 The church, the garden, and Mary\'s body were all \nmystically one; for she was Lady Ecclesia, the Church, as well as "the \npure womb of regeneration." Like a pagan temple, the Gothic cathedral \nrepresented the body of the Goddess who was also the universe, \ncontaining the essence of male godhood within herself. This was largely \nforgotten after the passing of the Gothic period. In later centuries, \n"Gothic" became an epithet of contempt, synonymous with "barba- \nrous." The symbolism of the Palaces of the Queen of Heaven was no \nlonger understood. By the 18th century, its secrets were as obscure as \nthe crypto-erotic art of the temples of India. 6 \n\nIn fact it was in India that the Great Mother, whose body was \nthe temple, was first addressed as Holy Rose. 7 The "Flower of the \nGoddess" was the scarlet China rose. 8 This was sometimes identified \nwith the mystic Kula flower, source of a virgin\'s menstrual blood, \nrepresenting the life of her future children and her bond of union \nwith the past maternal spirit of her clan. 9 \n\nThe eastern World Tree was often envisioned as a family rose- \ntree, a female Tree of Life and Immortality. In central Asia the tree \nwas called Woman, the Wellspring, Milk, Animals, Fruits. "The \nCosmic Tree always presents itself as the very reservoir of life and the \nmaster of destinies." Mongols knew the tree as Zambu, whose roots \nplunge to the base of Mount Sumer; it is the Mother-tree whose \nfruits feed the gods. 10 Zambu was undoubtedly the same as the Hindu \nparadise, Jambu Island, home of the cosmic Rose-Apple tree. The \nisland was shaped like a yoni. In its "diamond seat" (a symbolic clitoris), \none could be reborn as a human being with keen intelligence. 11 \n\nJudeo-Christian tradition associated this tree of ancestors with a \nmale Tree of Life (genitalia), regarding male ancestry as the only \nimportant kind. The genealogy of Christ was depicted in medieval art as \n\n\n\n867 \n\n\n\nRose \n\n\n\na tree-phallus rising from the loins of a recumbent Jesse, with its \nflowers and fruit surrounding the figures of David, Mary, and Jesus. \nStill, mystics generally assigned feminine gender to the rose-tree, \nrose-garden, rose-wreath, etc., fully realizing that these were genital \nsymbols. The medieval scholar Pierre Col said the Gospel of Luke \nrepresented the Holy Rose as a sign of the vulva. 12 \n\nBritain had a traditional Mummers\' dance known as The Rose: \nfive dancers formed a five-pointed star of swords over a victim, called \nthe Fool, who was symbolically slain and resurrected with a mysterious \nelixir, the Golden Frosty Drop, or Dewdrop in the Rose. This was \nsimply a western version of the Jewel in the Lotus: i.e., a seminal drop \nin the female flower. It is said the " \'garden\' may symbolize the \nuterus, as \'scarlet flower\' may signify the vulva." The Frosty Drop, or \ndew, signified the semen of the God reincarnating himself in the \nGoddess. The Bible says dew was a poetic synonym for semen (Song of \nSolomon 5:2). Meister Eckhart understood quite well the sexual \nsignificance of both dew and rose when he wrote, "And as in the \nmorning the rose opens, receiving the dew from heaven and the sun, \nso Mary\'s soul did open and receive Christ the heavenly dew." 1? \n\nThe dance called The Rose seems to have been a pagan ritual so \nvital that it couldn\'t be suppressed. The accompanying chant was \n"ring-around-the-rose-wreath"; in German, Ringel Ringel Rosenkranz; \nin English, Ring-Around-A-Rosy. 14 The "pocket full of posies" in \nthe nursery rhyme probably referred to the cave of flowers, an old \nsymbol of the underground Fairyland. The final instruction, "All fall \ndown," was the behest of Morgan the Grim Reaper, or Mother Death \nbringing an end to the fertility season. According to Danish folk \ncustom, roses decorated sacred groves for the dances of Midsummer \nEve, which had to be guarded by armed men against possible \nintruders: \n\nMidsummer night upon the sward, \nKnights and squires are standing guard; \nIn the grove a knightly dance they tread \nWith torches and garlands of roses red. I5 \n\nThe Rose was likened not only to Mary but to other surviving \nforms of the pagan Goddess. As Spenser\'s Faerie Queene she had a \nBower of Bliss signifying her sexual nature, where the central holy of \nholies was the Rose of Love. 16 Medieval myths of Lady Briar Rose \npictured the Virgin as a rose in the midst of a thorn bush, a sexual \nimage established long ago by the poet Sedulius: \n\nAs blooms among the thorns the lovely rose, herself without a thorn, \nThe glory of the bush whose crown she is, \nSo, springing from the root of Eve, Mary the new Maiden \nAtoned for the sin of that first Maiden longago.\' 7 \n\nNo matter how consistently the Rose was assimilated to Mary, it \nwas obviously a sexual symbol of Goddess- worship brought back to \n\n\n\n868 \n\n\n\nEurope from Arabia with the returning crusaders. 18 Sufi mystics in Rudra \n\nArabia wrote romantic-religious works centering on the rosary and the \n\nRose. Fariduddin Attar\'s Parliament of the Birds explained the ^^^^^^^^^^^ m \n\nsymbol in the words of the "passionate nightingale": \n\nI know the secrets of Jove. Throughout the night I give my love call . . . It \nis I who set the Rose in motion, and move the hearts of lovers. \nContinuously I teach new mysteries. . . . When the Rose returns to the \nworld in Summer, I open my heart to joy. My secrets are not known to \nall but the Rose knows them. I think of nothing but the Rose; I wish \nnothing but the ruby Rose. . . . Can the nightingale live but one night \nwithout the Beloved? \' 9 \n\nThis Eros-nightingale reappeared in European romances as the \nSpirit of the Rose, or a "devil" named Rosier in the 17th century. \nAccording to the exorcist Father Sebastien Michaelis, the devil \nRosier whispers sweet words that tempt men to fall in love. Rosier\'s \nheavenly adversary was St. Basil, "who would not listen to amorous \nand enchanting language." 20 Still later, the same devil became the hero \nof the classical ballet Le Spectre de la Rose in which he tempts a \nyoung girl to fall in love. \n\nSometimes the male Spirit of the Rose was a briar rose with \n\n"pricking" thorns. "Pricking flesh to acquire blood artificially is the \n\nonly way that men can \'produce\' it. In the European romantic legend of \n\ntwo heterosexual lovers, the female red rose is paired with the male \n\nbriar, or \'prick.\' Prick, when used as a slang, taboo name for the penis, is \n\na descriptive-magical term for access-to-power. . . . The briar is the \n\nmale rose." 21 \n\n1. Wilkins, 108, 136. 2. Hazlitt, 527. 3. Campbell, M.I., 235. 4. Wilkins, 108, 1 10, 133. \n5. Wilkins, 93, 106. 6. de Riencourt, 261. 7. Wilkins, 44. 8.

The Maruts became similar flayed gods or red gods \nin the west e.g. Mars the red god, and his Phrygian counterpart \nMarsyas, the flayed satyr, hung on a pine tree and sacrificed to Apollo. \nSatyrs were goat gods, and goats were typical victims of flaying- \nsacrifices for atonement in Rome (e.g., the Lupercalia), Phrygia, Syria, \nand Mesopotamia. \n\nRudra was also called Tryambaka, "He Who Belongs to Three \nMother Goddesses." 2 Like Shiva after him, he seems to have been \noffered to the original female trinity. Like Shiva also, he merged with \n\n\n\n869 \n\n\n\nRunes her or them and became known as an androgynous Lord Who is \n\nHalf Woman.\' \n\nHis name passed into Latin as "rude," meaning a primitive deity of \n\nwild animals and woodlands, a typical satyr. 4 Thus it might be said \nthat Rudra was the prototype of all the primitive Aryan gods of fertility \nand death. \n\n1.0\'Flaherty,357. 2.

Runic letters appear first in the hands of \nthe Goddess Idun, keeper of the gods\' magic apples of immortality. \nShe gave runes to her consort Bragi by engraving them on his tongue; \nthus he acquired the magic of words and became the first wizard-king \nof skaldic poetry. \n\nOdin received knowledge of the runes by his self-sacrifice, hanging \non the gallows-tree Yggdrasil for nine nights that is, for a nofnden, \nthe traditional lying-in period for a woman in childbirth. In the old \nmyths, self-sacrifice or suicide was often demanded as the price of \nmale acquisition of feminine wisdom. This also meant a journey to \nparadise (Fairyland), and godlike immortality. \n\nOdin died to acquire the runes for men; but men were expected to \nimitate his sacrifice, as Christian martyrs imitated that of Christ. If a \nNorse hero couldn\'t die in battle, which would automatically make him \na son of Odin, then he could commit a kind of hara-kiri by carving \nthe runes in his own flesh and bleeding to death. 1 In this manner Sigurd \nRing summoned the Valkyries to take him to Valholle: "Bravely he \nslashes Odin\'s red letters, blood-runes of heroes, on arm and breast." 2 \n\nThe festal day of a hero\'s death thus became a "red-letter day," \nmarked in red on runic calendars, as modern calendars still print \nSundays and holidays in red. Special sacrificial runes called geirs-odd \nwere recommended for ceremonial suicide. These enabled the hero \nto compose his own death-song in his final "inspiration" (literally, \n"breath"). Skaldic tradition associated poetry with blood. The Mead \nof the Poets was also called the Sea of Odin\'s Breast, meaning the blood \nthat flowed from his breast when he was pierced on the Rood. \n\nThe nursery-rhyme figure of slain Cock Robin Redbreast descend- \ned from the folklore of the geirs-odd. Robin was the God of the \nWitches, frequently identified with Odin, sacrificed in a sacred grove to \nMarian the Virgin, whom the Northmen called Maerin and wor- \nshipped with blood sacrifices at Trondheim as late as the 1 1th century. 3 \nRobin Redbreast appeared as a human martyr in an old Danish \nballad. He won the love of a bird-maiden (Valkyrie) by cutting slices of \nflesh from his breast for her, and she took him to paradise. "The \n\n\n\n870 \n\n\n\nyouth has now got his reward, safely has he won from harm; at night he Rusalki \n\nsleeps full joyously within his truelove\'s arms." 4 \n\nThe death song composed by Ragnar Lodbrok for himself presents ^^^^^^^^^^^ \na pagan version of a runic epitaph, supposed to be sung by the \nbleeding man with his final breath, like the song of a dying swan; \nindeed, runes and swan-princes were often associated. Ragnar sang, \nwith a certain gallantry: \n\nCease, my strain! I hear a voice \nFrom realms where martial souls rejoice; \nI hear the maids of slaughter call, \nWho bid me hence to Odin \'s hall: \nHigh seated in their blest abodes \nI soon shall quaff the drink of gods. \nThe hours of life have glided by; \nI fall, but smiling shall I die. 5 \n\nKnowing the runes of heathen alphabets were connected with \ndeath charms and mysterious curses, Christians came to regard the \nrunes as devilish. They believed witches could cause death by \n"casting the runes." But the original purpose of casting runes was \ndivination, in a system not essentially different from casting yarrow \nstalks of the I Ching, or casting "the lot of rods" in medieval churches, \nor casting dice as magic knucklebones, or shuffling Tarot cards. The \nrunes were scratched on wooden shingles or chips, like dice, and these \nwere thrown in certain patterns. The process of interpreting them \nwas raedan, "reading"; the result was raedelsox "riddles." In old- \nfashioned usage, "reading" meant to solve a riddle. 6 From the runes \ncame such English construction as "read me this riddle," and the use of \n"reading" to mean fortune-telling. \n\nI.

During Rusalki Week at the beginning \nof summer, they would emerge from the waters by moonlight and \ndance.

Sabazius seems to have been just another form \nof the ubiquitous serpent-deity who was the first companion of the \nGreat Mother of the Gods. \n\n1. Graves, W.G., 366-68. 2. Knight, S.L., 156. 3.

Churchmen said witches held four Great Sabbats a \nyear "in derision of the four annual festivals of the Church"; but the \nchurch had copied these from the pagans in the first place. 2 They were: \n(1) Candlemas Eve; (2) May Eve, or Walpurgisnacht; (3) Lammas \nEve; and (4) Halloween. Some lists included Midsummer (the Feast of \n\n\n\n874 \n\n\n\nSt. John) and the solstitial festival on December 2 1 (the Feast of St. Sabbat, Witches\' \n\nThomas). 3 \n\nDetails were drawn from classical descriptions of Roman fertility ^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\nfestivals, such as the Bacchanalia, Saturnalia, Lupercalia, etc. At the \nancient ceremony of purification for the New Year, in the Lupercal \ngrotto where Lupa the She-Wolf was said to have suckled Romulus \nand Remus, he-goats were sacrificed and youths were touched with the \nblood; priests in raw goatskins struck women\'s hands with strips of \ngoatskin as a fertility charm; men and women exchanged clothing and \nengaged in orgiastic sex. Late in the 5th century, this Lupercalia was \nadopted into the Christian calendar and renamed the Feast of Purifica- \ntion of the Virgin. 4 \n\nOther pagan practices supposedly incorporated into the witches\' \nsabbat included widdershins (counterclockwise) dancing in a ring, in \nhonor of the Moon-goddess; wearing masks; jumping over fires; sacrifi- \ncial feasting; worshipping trees, springs, and sacred stones; and \nmaking lewd jokes and horseplay in a carnival atmosphere. Indeed the \nCarnival, or Feast of Fools, descended from pagan holidays when the \nsocial order was temporarily reversed, and everything was done back- \nward, a prototype of the "reverse Christianity" of the Black Mass. \nThe Saturnalia was still kept by medieval Christians in this manner: \n\nThe priests of a church elected a bishop of fools, who came in full pomp, \nplacing himself in the episcopal seat in the choir. High mass then \nbegan; all the ecclesiastics assisted, their faces smeared with blacking, or \ncovered with a hideous or ridiculous mask. During the course of the \ncelebration, some of them, dressed like mountebanks or in women \'s \nclothes, danced in the middle of the choir, singing clownish or obscene \nsongs. Others ate sausages or puddings from the altar, played at cards or at \ndice in front of the officiating priest, incensed him with the censer, or, \nburning old shoes, made him breathe the smoke. s \n\nSuch carnival clownishness was "simply the last form which the \nPriapeia and Liberalia assumed in Western Europe, and in its various \ndetails all the incidents of those great and licentious orgies of the \nRomans were reproduced." 6 However, certain authorities came to \nperceive such revels as profoundly evil. In 1445 the Paris Faculty of \nTheology called for reform, writing to the French bishops a puritanical- \nly shocked description of pre- Lenten customs: "Priests and clerks \nmay be seen wearing masks and monstrous visages at the hours of office. \nThey dance in the choir dressed as women, panders or minstrels. \nThey sing wanton songs. They eat black puddings at the horn of the \naltar while the celebrant is saying Mass. They play at dice there. \nThey cense with stinking smoke from the soles of old shoes. They run \nand leap through the church, without a blush at their own shame." 7 \n\nCopies of letters like this one, drawn from the archives, surely gave \nthe Inquisition\'s judges many ideas for details of the Sabbat that they \nput in the mouths of their victims, and confirmed by torture. With only \n\n\n\n875 \n\n\n\nSad minimal imagination, a judge could reverse any ordinary church \n\n\n\nSacred \n\n\n\nservice and accuse his victim of kissing the devil\'s anus (instead of the \nbishop\'s ring), eating children\'s corpses and drinking menstrual blood \n(instead of bread and wine), saying the prayers backward, making the \nsign of the cross with the left foot instead of the right hand, addressing \nsubterranean deities instead of celestial ones, and so on. \n\nWeekly sabbats were supposed to be held on Friday, once a lunar \n"Eve" of the original sabbath, the day of Saturn or of Zeus Sabazius. \nFriday was the day sacred to Venus-Freya, and after sunset it was the \nJews\' sabbath day, both of which made it a bad or unlucky day in \nChristian opinion. Friday the 13th was especially ill-favored. \n\nl.Ravensdale& Morgan, 153; Shah, 210. 2. Knight, D.W.P., 225. 3. Robbins,415. \n4. Larousse, 208. 5. Crawley, 333. 6. Knight, D.W.P., 207. 7.

O\'Flaherty, 351. 2. Larousse, 36. \n\n\n\nSacred \n\nDerivation of Latin sacer, which meant "untouchable" in the dual \nsense of both holy and unclean. A sacer person or thing was set aside for \na divine purpose; it was taboo, dedicated to the other world, shunned \nby ordinary folk because of its dangerous charge of spiritual mana. A \ncase in point is the biblical story of Uzzah, who dared to seize the ark \nof the covenant to keep it from falling off its oxcart. Though Uzzah\'s \nintentions were entirely honorable, God struck him dead for touching \nthe sacer object (2 Samuel 6:3). Priests knew a special insulating charm \nwhereby they could approach the Holy of Holies without deadly risk: \n"When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash \nwith water, that they die not" (Exodus 30:20). This same insulating \ncharm was used throughout the centuries in Catholic churches, where \npeople dipped their fingers in the stoup of holy water and made a self- \nprotective sign of the cross. \n\nThe biblical word "unclean" also meant sacer. Menstrual blood \nand parturient women were "unclean" because filled with mysteri- \nous, dangerous magic (Leviticus 15). Sacrificial victims, set aside for \nconsumption by the gods, were sacer. Certain animals were "unclean" \n\n\n\n876 \n\n\n\nexcept when eaten on ceremonial occasions, like the sacred bulls of Sacrifice \n\nEgypt and the pigs of Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine. Lucian said the \n\npigs kept in the temple at Hierapolis were taboo in the typical ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ndualistic sense, both "unclean" and sacred. 1 Simple people everywhere \n\nstill demonstrate fear in the presence of whatever they consider \n\nsacred: the common emotion Coleridge called "holy dread." \n\n1. Crawley 1,1 14. \n\n\n\nSacrifice \n\n\n\nHuman or animal, the sacrificial victims of ancient cultures were \nalmost invariably male. Worshippers of Shiva sacrificed only male \nanimals; the god himself ordered that female animals must never be \nslain. 1 Males were expendable, for there were always too many for a \nproper breeding stock. \n\nThe same was true even of human sacrifices, which were men, not \nwomen. "The fertility of a group is determined by the number of its \nadult women, rather than by its adult men." 2 Therefore male blood \nonly was poured out on the earliest altars, in imitation of the female \nblood that gave "life." That is why totemic animal-ancestors were more \noften paternal than maternal. The animals\' blood and flesh, ingested \nby women, was thought to beget human offspring; and the rule was \n"Whatever is killed becomes father." 3 The victim was also god, and \nking. \n\nAmazonian Sacae or Scythians founded the Sacaea festivals of \nBabylon, where condemned criminals died as sacrificial surrogates for \nthe king, to mitigate the earlier custom of king-killing. The chosen \nvictim was a sacred king, identified with the real king in every possible \nway. He wore the king\'s robes, sat on the king\'s throne, lay with the \nroyal concubines, wielded the scepter. After five days he was stripped, \nscourged, then hanged or impaled "between heaven and earth," in a \nprototype of the crucifixion ceremony later extended to sacred kings \nof the Jews. 4 The object of scourging and piercing was to make the \npseudo-king shed tears and blood for fertility magic. 5 Babylonian \nscriptures said, "If the king does not weep when struck, the omen is bad \nfor the year." 6 The king or pseudo-king "became God" as soon as he \nwas dead. He ascended into heaven and united himself with the \nHeavenly Father, i.e., the original totem father, or first victim. 7 \nProbably the promise of apotheosis and privileged immortality induced \nvictims to accept death willingly, even as the same kind of promise \nattracted Christian martyrs. \n\nWhen ritual murder of kings or human king-surrogates came to be \nconsidered crude and uncivilized, then animal victims took their \nplace. Ceremonies were invented to identify the animal with the man. \nThe Egyptians, for instance, "put off their dead with counterfeits, \noffered an animal to their gods instead of a man, but they symbolized \n\n\n\n877 \n\n\n\nSacrifice their intended act by marking the creature to be slain with a seal \n\nbearing the image of a man bound and kneeling, with a sword at his \n\n^^^^^^^a throat." 8 \n\nPigs were often set aside as sacer victims in Egypt, India, and the \nMiddle East, which explains why their flesh was taboo to the Jews. \nThe sacrificial boar-god Vishnu had many western counterparts, such as \nAres, the boarskin-clad consort of Aphrodite, whose children Phobos \n(Fear), Deimos (Horror), and Harmonia (Peace) may have represented \nthe three stages of the sacred drama from the victim\'s point of \nview. 9 \n\nMeat was not to be wasted, so early theologians were anxious to \ninvent ways to pretend the sacrifice was politely offered to the deity, \nwhile they actually kept it for their own consumption. The usual \nmethod was to offer the deity only inedible portions of the animal, or \nportions that couldn\'t be readily collected and used, such as blood. \n"Kosher killing," draining the blood from a sacrificed animal, was not \na Jewish idea. It was a common Oriental method of offering the \nanimal\'s blood to the Great Earth Mother while the worshipper kept \nthe meat for himself. 10 The Jews, like the Hindus, taught that the \nanimal\'s soul was in its blood (Leviticus 17:1 1). \n\nGreeks assumed their gods resented being deprived of the best part \nof the sacrifice, but they avoided guilt by blaming Zeus\'s ancient rival, \nthe titan Prometheus. When the first sacrificial bull was butchered, \nPrometheus sorted it into a portion of bones concealed under fat, and \nanother portion of meat hidden under the entrails, and invited Zeus to \nchoose his portion on behalf of all the gods. Zeus chose the fat, and \nlater raged helplessly when he found he had been tricked. 11 But this \nbecame the standard fare for the gods, even Yahweh: "the fat of the \nbeast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord" \n(Leviticus 7:25). \n\nJews were even more parsimonious with their offerings than the \nGreeks. Sometimes Yahweh didn\'t even get the fat of the beast. All \nhe got was a smell of it. Levite priests legalized the "wave offering," \nwhich meant the goodies were waved in front of the altar, then eaten \nby the priests: "the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the \nLord . . . but the breast shall be Aaron\'s and his sons\' " (Leviticus \n7:30-3 1). The Jews however did retain a custom of human sacrifice, for \nspecial occasions, longer than any other people in the sphere of \ninfluence of the Roman empire. 12 Out of this tradition arose the figure \nof the dying Christos in Jerusalem. \n\nConcerning the biblical concept of sacrifice, E.C. Stanton wrote: \n"The people have always been deluded with the idea that what they \ngave to the church and the priesthood was given unto the Lord, as if the \nmaker of the universe needed anything at our hands. How incongru- \nous the idea of an Infinite being who made all the planets and the \ninhabitants thereof commanding his creatures to kill and burn animals \nfor offerings to him. It is truly pitiful to see the deceptions that have \n\n\n\n878 \n\n\n\nbeen played upon the people in all ages and countries by the priests Saga \n\nin the name of religion." n Saints \n\n\n\nI.

Helene, or Feu de S. Herme: Fire of \nthe Holy Helen or the Holy Hermes. In Spain it was known as St. \nHelmes or St. Telmes fire, regarded as a form of witchfire, like the \nFata Morgana (marsh gas). 1 In fact it is a static discharge from points \nsuch as masts and spars of a ship, or from the wings of earlier \nairplanes. \n\nAccording to some sea stories, if one flame appears, it is Helen, \nwho presages bad weather; if two flames appear, they are Helen\'s \nbrothers Castor and Pollux, who indicate that the weather will clear, and \nalso that even sea-myths demonstrate patriarchal bias. Other names \nfor the mysterious light are Corposant from Italian corpo santo, \nChrist\'s body St. Anne\'s Light, and even Saint Electricity. 2 \n\nSaint Elmo was entirely mythical. Some scholars claimed he was \nthe same as St. Erasmus of Syria, who was also mythical, his legend \nbased only on a spurious "Acts" written three centuries after his alleged \nmartyrdom. It was claimed that he died of having his intestines \nwound out of his body onto a windlass; therefore his symbol in sacred \nart was a windlass. Through this tenuous link, he became a patron \nsaint of sailors. 3 But since he probably never existed at all, the point is \nonly academic. \n\n1. Hazlitt, 94. 2. Jobes, 180. 3. Attwater, 117. \n\n\n\nSaints \n\nCanonization of saints was a Christian extension of the ancient Greco- \nRoman custom of apotheosis (god-making), whereby mortals could \nbecome immortal and live forever in heaven through identification with \n\n\n\n879 \n\n\n\nSaints a deity. The liturgy and forms of canonization were taken from the \n\npagans, including the ceremonial release of bird-souls to represent the \ndeified one flying to heaven to join the other immortals. 1 \n\nThe canon of saints made Christianity in effect a form of polythe \nism, just as the similar system of multiplying bodhisattvas created a \nBuddhist polytheism. Medieval Europeans wanted many deities, not \none. Thus, in medieval churches, "the life of Christ fills a smaller \nplace and is told with far less complacence than are the lives of the \nsaints." 2 Much time and effort were expended to ascertain the right \nsaint or saints to answer any particular kind of appeal. \n\nThe mythical saints included numerous transformations of the \nGreat Goddess under names that were only her various pagan titles, \nin the same way as the Judeo-Christian God was called "Almighty" or \n"Ancient of Days" or "Lord." Among the sainted Goddess-names \nwere Mari, Marina, Margaret, Aphra, Venerina, Martina, Mary of \nEgypt, the Three Marys, Aphrodite, Demetra, and such title-names \nas Irene, Philomena, Reine, Pelagia, Corona, Rosalia, Sophia, Eugenia, \nViviana, Columba (Peace, Moon-lover, Queen, Sea, Crown, Holy \nRose, Wisdom, Health, Life, Dove). 3 \n\nDiana Ilithyia was canonized as St. Yllis. Artemis became St. \nArtemidos. Keraunos the thunder-serpent became St. Ceraunos. \nCastor and Pollux were transformed into Sts. Cosmas and Damianus, \nwhose images replaced those of the pagan Heavenly Twins in their \nhealing shrine at Aegaeae. Sts. Sebastian and Hubert, patrons of archers \nand hunting dogs, were once pagan Lords of the Hunt; so was St. \nEustace, allegedly converted by Christ who spoke to him from the horns \nof a magic stag. 4 \n\nThe sun god Helios became St. Elias. Gods and heroes like \nBacchus, Dionysus, Hyacinthus, Narcissus, Nereus, and Achilles \nwere canonized under their own names. Mercury became a warrior- \nsaint, supposedly sent from heaven to assassinate the emperor Julian, \n"the Apostate." Under his other name, Hermes, he was canonized by \nthe spurious passio of Pope Alexander I. The satyr-god Silvanus was \ncanonized, and called a son of the equally fictitious St. Felicity. 5 Even \nBuddha became a Christian saint, disguised as St. Josaphat (Bodisat). 6 \n\nAs St. Aphra or Afra, Aphrodite appeared in the role of a repentant \nprostitute, embracing martyrdom to atone for her promiscuous be- \nhavior. She was quoted as saying, "My body has sinned, let it suffer." \nShe was burned to death on an island in the river Lech meaning \nthat the Goddess\'s image was burned in its former Temple of Lechery. \n\nA late absurdity was the canonization of the Goddess\'s Holy Vial \nas an anthropomorphic saint, which one 18th-century historian \nreferred to as St. Ampoule. 8 \n\nAbout the beginning of the 9th century, bones, teeth, hair, \ngarments, and other relics of fictitious saints were conveniently \n"found" all over Europe and Asia and triumphantly installed in the \nreliquaries of every church, until all Catholic Europe was falling to its \n\n\n\n880 \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\n\nknees before what Calvin called its anthill of bones. 9 Martyrs\' remains Saints \n\nbecame extremely valuable, as Gibbon says: "The satisfactory experi- \nence that the relics of saints were more valuable than gold or precious ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nstones stimulated the clergy to multiply the treasures of the church. \nWithout much regard for truth or probability, they invented names for \nskeletons, and actions for names." 10 Myths invented for the fictitious \nrelics of the evangelists provide typical examples. \n\nSome Venetian merchants pretended to find the bones of St. Mark \nin Alexandria in 81 5. They brought their find home to Venice and \nsold it to the municipal treasury. A great church was built over the bones \nin the Square of St. Mark who was only associated with the city in \nthe first place because the original municipal totem was a lion, and the \nevangelist was assigned to the season of Leo in the pagan calendar. \nThe bones remain in Venice to this day, for the fiction has not yet been \nrenounced. \n\nIn like manner, the bones of "St. Matthew" were dug up in \nParthia at Hierapolis, and carried to a church in Salerno in 1080 a.d., \nat the height of the early saint-making fad. Matthew\'s legend was \ninvented by Pope Gregory VII, who claimed to have learned by \ndivine inspiration of the apostle\'s travels through Egypt, Ethiopia, and \nother places, and of the miracles he worked to shame the poor magic \nof pagan magicians. 11 St. Luke was touted as one of the ancient world\'s \nmost prolific artists, to judge from the numerous portraits of the \nVirgin, painted by him, that appeared in many churches. Some still \nremain, despite ample proof that all such portraits were actually \npainted during the Middle Ages. 12 \n\nConversion of pagan gods and goddesses to saints usually accom- \npanied the church\'s takeover of their shrines. An example is the \nso-called Isle of Saints whose sacred inhabitants were not saints at all but \nwomen called Gallicenae, former priestesses of the Gallic oracle. \nPomponius Mela, Latin geographer of the 1st century a.d., said they \nwere "holy in perpetual virginity, said to be nine in number, with \nsingular powers, so as to raise by their charms the winds and seas, to turn \nthemselves into what animals they will, to cure wounds and diseases \nincurable by others, to know and predict the future; but this they do \nonly to navigators who go thither purposely to consult them." 15 \n\nLike pagan oracles and wise-women, sacrificial gods were also \nconverted into saints. The Blutritt (blood rite) of northern heathens was \neasily transformed into a Christian ceremony by simple substitution \nof the blood of Christ or the relic of a local saint, the former god. A \n10th-century ecclesiastical decree in Westphalia ordered that "every \nyear, on the second day of Whitsuntide, with the grace of the Holy \nGhost, ye shall bear the patron saint of your cloister church in a long \nprocession through your parochial district. . . . This processional will \ncause the seed of the fields to grow more abundantly, and the \nharshness of the weather will be subdued." H \n\nIn the old shrines of Great Mother Cybele at Acrae in Sicily, \n\n\n\n881 \n\n\n\nSaints rock-cut niches dating from the 3rd century B.C. sheltered numerous \n\nfigures of the Goddess, some dating from a much earlier period. After \n^^^^^^^^^^^ Christian conquest of the area, the Goddess\'s figures became known as \nSantoni, "saints," and are so called to this day. 15 \n\nPseudo-saints often retained jurisdiction over those departments of \nnature that they ruled as pagan deities. St. Medardus controlled the \nrain, and during droughts his statue was drenched with water to \nstimulate him to action. St. Caesarius of Aries was identified with \nBoreas, god of the north wind. In the valley of Vaison his holy glove was \nsaid to hold the air that let loose winds and storms, so his power \nactually approximated that of Satan who was Prince of the Power of the \nAir. 16 \n\nThe church that slaughtered the heathen for worshipping false \ngods was itself guilty of worshipping false saints which, sometimes, \nwere even the same deities as those of the heathen. This became so \nobvious in the 8th century that the Synod of Leptinnes had to \nprohibit the offering of sacrifices to saints instead of to God. 17 \n\nChristians surpassed their pagan ancestors in credulity, propagating \nand believing saintly miracle-tales apparently without any limitations. \nPope Gregory the Great wrote a book of saints\' lives filled with \nimpossible feats. St. Honoratus for example halted in mid-air a giant \nboulder that was rolling down a mountainside toward his monastery \nsimply by making the sign of the cross at it. The monk Maurus \nwalked on water, like Jesus and St. Peter. 18 In fact, the miracles \nattributed to Jesus were negligible compared to the wonders per- \nformed by saints. Angobard wrote in the 9th century, "The wretched \nworld lies now under the tyranny of foolishness; things are believed \nby Christians of such absurdity as no one ever could aforetime induce \nthe heathen to believe." 19 \n\nThe church never lost sight of practical common sense on one \npoint, however; saints were leading sources of its income, thanks to \nthe mandatory pilgrimage system, donations, and tithes. Gold, silver, \nand gems were collected to house and adorn the precious relics. An \necclesiastical chronicler of Trier related how the priests buried the \nchurch\'s treasures to hide them from attacking Norsemen, "so that \nthe relics might not be mocked and jeered at by the barbarians." 20 Of \ncourse the real fear was not mockery of the relics, but robbery of their \nvaluable vessels. \n\nSome genuine flesh-and-blood saints achieved their canonization \nby adding to the wealth of the church through trickery. A common \ntrick seems to have been manipulation of the popular belief in ghosts. \nSt. Fridolin of Sakingen claimed for the church the property of a \ndeceased Count Urso, on the ground that Urso had promised it to the \nchurch while receiving the last rites from Fridolin. But the property \nhad passed into the hands of Urso\'s heir, his brother Landolf, and there \n\n\n\n882 \n\n\n\nwas no document to prove Fridolin\'s claim. However, the saint won Saints \n\nhis case by summoning Count Urso himself to rise from the grave and \n\nappear before the judges, testifying "in sepulchral tones" that Lan- ^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\ndolf \'s holdings must be turned over to the monastery. The unfortunate \n\nLandolf lost not only his inheritance, but also his life. Fridolin \n\nbecame the patron saint of Sakingen and was buried in the church he \n\nbuilt with the dead man\'s money. 21 \n\nThe same thing happened in the case of St. Stanislaus the Martyr, \nBishop of Cracow, who managed some "very ample estates" belong- \ning to a man named Peter. After Peter\'s death, his heirs claimed the \n| estates, but the bishop refused to part with them. As he was unable to \nshow any documents of ownership, a court ruled in favor of Peter\'s \nheirs. Then the bishop went to Peter\'s tomb, touched the body, and \ncommanded it to rise and follow him to the court. The corpse then \n"confirmed the statement of the bishop in every particular, and \nfearful as they sat the judges reversed their former decision." 22 The wily \nsaint kept the estates, doubtless contributing a share to whatever \naccomplice it was who impersonated the dead Peter. \n\nSuch miracles were more common than might be expected. The \nsame thing happened in the time of St. Augustine the Apostle of \nEngland, according to his biographer John Brompton. "St. Augustine \nhad long been endeavoring to persuade a certain nobleman of great \nwealth to pay the appointed tithes, but out of obstinacy these were \nconstantly refused, which did great mischief and caused others to \nbecome discontented and impudently follow so bad an example." One \nday during High Mass, St. Augustine directed all who were excom- \nmunicate to leave the church. A tomb in the crypt suddenly opened, \nand a corpse came forth, explaining that it had been excommunicated \nby a priest now dead. St. Augustine led witnesses to the dead priest\'s \ntomb, and asked why the revenant had been excommunicated. The \npriestly ghost replied, in "a low, far-off" voice, "I excommunicated him \nfor his misdeeds, and particularly because he robbed the church of \nher due, refusing to pay his tithes." 25 Through this elaborate charade, \nthe saint was able to improve economic piety in the district. \n\nThe multitudes of phony or commercial saints are treated by \nmodern Catholic scholars with a rather amused tolerance, as if the \nsaint-makers\' fantasies held something of the same charm as tales \ninvented by bright children. It is rarely admitted that these fantasies \nwere not intended to charm but rather to defraud. The saints were \nmade up to earn money for the church, and many of the made-up \nsaints are still doing so, for the church refrains from publicizing their \nspurious origins lest such publicity might disappoint the faithful \nwhich, translated, means the donations might cease. \n\n1.

Jeru-salem was "the House of \nPeace," or of the god Salem, whose earlier city was ruled by \nMelchizedek (Genesis 14), the "King of Light" called Melek or \nMolech in Phoenicia. "Peace" was the word spoken daily to the \ndying sun, and also to the dying sacrificial victim who impersonated him \nin the rites that "brought forth bread and wine" (Genesis 14:18). See \nLucifer. \n\n\n\nSaliva \n\nBoth Mohammed and Jesus claimed to restore sight to the blind by \napplying saliva to their eyes (Mark 8:23). This was an imitation of cures \npreviously attributed to priestesses of the Goddess. A clay tablet from \nNineveh says eye diseases could be cured by the mixed saliva and milk \nof a temple harlot. Romans thought blindness could be cured by the \nsaliva of a mother of sons. As late as the 19th century, Italian folk \nhealers were still trying to cure blindness with the saliva and milk of \nthe mother of a premature child. 1 \n\nNotions of the wonderful curative power of female saliva may be \ntraced back to Tantrism and its Chinese offshoot, Tao, whose \nscriptures called women\'s saliva "a great medicine," one of the three \nwonderful yin juices, the others being breast milk and menstrual \nblood. 2 \n\nEuropean pagan heroes also cured blindness with saliva so many \nof them that medieval churchmen had to say this was one of the \nrecognition signs for Antichrist. 3 \n\n1.

Gifford, 120. \n\n\n\nSalome \n\nThe Bible presents the Dance of the Seven Veils as a mere vulgar \nstriptease performed by Salome to "please Herod" (Matthew 14:6-8). \nActually, the Dance of the Seven Veils was an integral part of the \nsacred drama, depicting the death of the surrogate-king, his descent into \nthe underworld, and his retrieval by the Goddess, who removed one \nof her seven garments at each of the seven underworld gates. The \npriestess called Salome or "Peace" (Shalom) impersonated the de- \nscending Goddess, passing through seven gates in the temple of \nJeru-salem which meant House of Peace. "Josephus records that the \n\n\n\n885 \n\n\n\nSalt \n\n\n\nfirst name of the city was Solyma. Salma, or Salim, was evidently the \nSemite god of the rising or renewed sun; Salmaone was the Aegean \ngoddess from whom he took his titles, as did Salmoneus the Aeolian." \' \n\nSalome represented Ishtar as the third of her three high priestesses \nor "Marys." Her name was a translation of the Greek Irene, \n"Peace," the third of the sacred harlots called Horae. 2 She may have \nbeen identical with the sacred harlot Mary Magdalene, or Mary of \nthe Temple, whose so-called "seven devils" were the same underworld \ngatekeepers to whom the temple dancer gave her veils. These veils, \nlike the rainbow veils of Maya, signified the layers of earthly appear- \nances or illusions falling away from those who approach the central \nMystery of the deeps. Isis too had seven stoles with the same mystical \nsignificance. 3 \n\nThe dancing priestess was more than a trivial entertainer. Salome\'s \nhusband Joseph was killed after he lay with the queen, Mariamne or \nMiriam (Mary). 4 Salome was present with the virgin Mary the same \nMary? at the birth of Jesus; some said she was the midwife who \ndelivered the holy child. 5 Salome was present with all three Marys at the \ndeath of Jesus (Mark 15:40). Obviously she was also involved in the \ndeath of John the Baptist, which seems to have been not a murder but a \nritual sacrifice. \n\nSome early Christian sects (the Mandaeans) ignored Jesus, and \nworshipped John the Baptist as the true sacrificed Christ. 6 An early \nGreek epiphany hymn said it was the blood of John the Baptist that \n"bedewed" i.e., fructified the mothers and children of Jerusa- \nlem. 7 As an initiated Essenic prophet, John would have been sacer and \n"chosen" to die as a surrogate for the king, whose blood was required \nfor fertility of the land. John was beheaded, a common form of sacrificial \ndeath throughout the early Aegean and Levantine cultures, still \npracticed to this day in some of the eastern temples of the Goddess, \nthough the victims are now animals instead of men. 8 \n\nThough only a fragment in its present form, the story of Salome \npresents evidence for the survival of the Tammuz-Ishtar cult in \nJerusalem, where someone periodically died in the role of the god, and \nthe women raised the ancient lament for the victim in the temple \n(Ezekiel 8:14). \n\n1.

M., 1 52. \n\n\n\nSalt \n\nOne of the few substances known to the ancients that could preserve \nfoodstuffs and dead bodies was salt. Egyptian mummies were preserved \nin a brine solution called natron, "birth-fluid." Salt was accepted as a \nsubstitute for the Mother\'s regenerative blood; it came from the sea- \nwomb and had the savor of blood. Therefore salt became a symbolic \n\n\n\n886 \n\n\n\ninstrument of kinship, like maternal blood. The Roman rite of con far- alt \n\nreatio (patrician marriage) had the bride and groom share a cake of \n\nflour and salt, which stood for flesh and blood respectively, and \n\nmagically transformed them like those who in older times shared \nreal flesh and blood into blood kin, unable to harm one another. 1 \n\nThe Arabs signified a similar bond of good faith by sharing a meal \nof bread and salt, which created the binding portion of any covenant. \nThe Bible speaks of a "covenant of salt" (Numbers 18:19) as one that \ncannot be broken, even when it is a covenant between man and God. \nSalt was an acceptable substitute for blood also in dedicating an altar, \neither Jewish or Christian (see Blessing). \n\nA common Semitic metaphor for enlightened seers was "salt of the \nearth," i.e., true blood of the Earth Mother. The term was applied to \nChrist\'s followers (Matthew 5:31) to suggest that they could prophesy \ntruly. \n\nChristian uses of salt were copied largely from Roman pagans, who \nused salt to bless every public sacrifice. "Immolate" came from mola, \nthe flesh-and-blood-symbolic combination of salt and flour prepared by \nthe Vestal Virgins to sprinkle over every beast that was led to \nsacrifice. 2 \n\nChurch bells were solemnly anointed with salt and water, wiped \nwith linen, blessed, and christened. God was requested to give the \nbells power to dispel demons by their sound, and to send thunder and \nlightning far away from the vicinity of the church though bell- \nringing was never very successful in the latter endeavor, since church \nbell-towers were struck by lightning more often than any other \nstructure. 5 \n\nChristian infant baptism often involved rubbing the infant with salt \nto repel demons. It was said that heretics carefully rubbed the salt off. 4 \n\nSuperstitious fear of spilling salt was directly related to the idea of \nspilling blood. Throwing a pinch of salt over the shoulder to take off \nthe curse was a symbolic way of putting bloodshed "behind," or turning \none\'s back on it. \n\nNatural salt pillars in the vicinity of the Dead Sea proved profitable \nto enterprising medieval Saracens, who learned that Christians would \npay good money to be guided to the exact spot where "Lot\'s wife" \nstood, to behold a biblical miracle with their own eyes. Eroded by \nwind, the salt pillars often assumed fantastic shapes. One may well have \nbeen shaped like a woman; if not, a few touches of the chisel could \nmake it so. \n\nCabalistic tradition suggests that the biblical Lot\'s wife was really a \nform of the Triple Goddess. Hebrew MLH, "salt," is a sacred word \nbecause its numerical value is that of God\'s name of power, YH WH, \nmultiplied three times. 5 The same word is also a root of Malkuth, the \ncabalistic Queen Mother Earth. \n\n1.

Samson\'s "mill" was the same as Omphale\'s wheel, to which \nHeracles was bound. His loss of hair meant the cutting of the sun god\'s \nrays, in the season when he became weak. \n\nAs Heracles was controlled by Omphale, and Ra was "made weak" \nby Isis, so Samson was deprived of his strength in due season by \nDelilah, "She Who Makes Weak." Another interpretation of her name \nwas Lily of the Yoni, that is, the female principle that deprived the \nphallic god of strength by drawing his "rays" or energy into herself. \nHair-cutting was a common mythic symbol of castration, since phallic \npower was supposed to reside in a man\'s hair, according to ancient \neastern beliefs. 1 The castrating priestess Delilah was a Semitic copy of \nHeracles\'s deadly consort Deianira, the instrument of his destruction. \nBlinding, also, meant putting out the "phallic eye." \n\nTalmudic tradition viewed Samson\'s "grinding" in Philistia as a \nsymbol of fornication suggesting a sacred-king cult in which a \nstrongman assumed the role of the sun hero, deflowered all the virgins \nuntil his strength was gone, then faced castration and sacrifice. 2 It has \n\n\n\n888 \n\n\n\nbeen supposed that Samson\'s wrecking of the Philistine temple stood for Sanguis ac Genus \n\nithe sun\'s power to dry out and crumble a structure made of mud Sapientia \n\ncricks. ^^^^^t^^^mi^^m \n\n1.

In \nfact Sapientia was sometimes represented as "the Siren of the Philoso- \nphers," pouring the red-and-white wines of enlightenment from her \nbreasts, rising from the sea like a crowned Aphrodite. 1 \n\nRenaissance mystics depicted Sapientia as the Shakti of God, \nidentifying her sometimes with the virgin Mary, sometimes with \nMother Nature, sometimes with God\'s "inner mind" or Goddess- \nWithin (I-dea). She was described as God\'s wisdom; indeed, as "all \nthe wisdom he had." 2 Spenser said Sapientia dwelt in God\'s bosom, as \nhis spouse, "the sovereign darling of the Deity, clad like a Queen in \nroyal robes." She was described as "the basic and primordial foundation \nof all things ... the being, life, and light of intelligible things," and a \nTriple Goddess: Sapientia creans, the Creatress; Sapientia disponans, \n"who unites all things in harmony"; and Sapientia gubernans, "other- \nwise known as Divine Providence." 5 \n\nThe Christian writer pseudo-Dionysius credited Sapientia with \ncreation itself, calling her "Thou unbegun and everlasting Wisdom, \nthe which in thyself art the sovereign-substantial Firsthood, the sover- \neign Goddess, and the sovereign Good." 4 \n\n\n\n889 \n\n\n\nSapphire Sapientia was the hidden Creatress of medieval thought the \n\nSara-Kali unofficial Goddess supposedly eliminated from Europe\'s religions \n\n^^^^^^^^^^_ centuries earlier, but still living fragmented under various names: Mary, \nNature, Luna, Earth, Venus, or Sophia. \n\nI. de Givry, 361. 2. von Franz, 16. 3.

According to Jewish tradition, \nSarah ranked higher than her husband, and her death brought "confu- \nsion" to a nation that was in good order while she lived. 3 She was \ninterred in the holy cave of Machpelah, a womb-necropolis of the \nGoddess of the Anakim. Votive idols in this cave were later adopted \nby the Jews and called by the names of deified ancestors: Sarah, \nAbraham, Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob. 4 \n\n1. Briffault 3, 1 10. 2. Graves, W.

Some gypsies appeared in 10th-century \nPersia as tribes of itinerant dervishes calling themselves Kalenderees, \n\n\n\n890 \n\n\n\n"people of the Goddess Kali." ! A common gypsy clan name is still Sara-Kali \n\nKaldera or Calderash, descended from past Kali-worshippers, like the \n\nKele-De of Ireland. 2 ^^^^^^^^ \n\nEuropean gypsies relocated their Goddess in the ancient "Druid \nGrotto" underneath Chartres Cathedral, once the interior of a sacred \nmount known as the Womb of Gaul, when the area was occupied by \nthe Carnutes, "Children of the Goddess Car." Carnac, Kermarjo, \nKerlescan, Kercado, Carmona in Spain, and Chartres itself were named \nafter this Goddesss, probably a Celtic version of Kore or Q\'re, \ntraceable through eastern nations to Kauri, another name for Kali. 3 \n\nThe Druid Grotto used to be occupied by the image of a black \nGoddess giving birth, similar to certain images of Kali. 4 Christians \nadopted this ancient idol and called her Virgo Paritura, "Virgin Giving \nBirth." Gypsies called her Sara-Kali, "the mother, the woman, the \nsister, the queen, the Phuri Dai, the source of all Romany blood." They \nsaid the black Virgin wore the dress of a gypsy dancer, and every \ngypsy should make a pilgrimage to her grotto at least once in his life. \nThe grotto was described as "your mother\'s womb." A gypsy pilgrim \nwas told: "Shut your eyes in front of Sara the Kali, and you will know \nthe source of the spring of life which flows over the gypsy race." 5 \n\nA gypsy prayer to the Goddess demonstrates her Kali-like trinity of \nCreator, Preserver, and Destroyer: \n\nThou destroyest and dost make everything on earth; thou canst see \nnothing old, for death lives in thee, thou givest birth to all upon the \nearth for thou thyself art life. . . . Thou art the mother of every living \ncreature and the distributor of good; thou doest according to thy \nwisdom in destroying what is useless or what has lived its destined time; by \nthy wisdom thou makest the earth to regenerate all that is new. . . . \n[TJhou are the benefactress of mankind. 6 \n\nSara-Kali was also known as Bibi, "the Aunt," a Destroyer- \nCrone corresponding to Russia\'s Baba Yaga. Like the Kalika who \ncreated fatal illnesses, Bibi "has the power to cause all kinds of \ndisease, especially at the beginning of a new month when there is a full \nmoon." 7 Bibi dressed in red, recalling the red-clothed Kali at the final \ndissolution of the world when her garment is made of "a red mass of \nblood" from all the gods she devours. 8 As Kali\'s dakinis identified \nthemselves with the Destroyer at ceremonies of death, so gypsy women \nwore red for funerals. 9 \n\nGypsies also used the Indo-Egyptian Yoni Yantra (triangle) as a \nsign for "woman," practiced Tantric sexual rites like those of the east, \nand believed in reincarnation according to Hindu doctrines of karma \ngoverned by the Goddess. The gypsy said, "The sands of truth will \ndeposit me on the bed of earth from which I came. . . . [Njaked, I shall \nreturn to the womb of my mother." 10 \n\nSome gypsies insisted that Sara-Kali was Queen of Heaven and \nEarth. According to a secret tradition, all the cathedrals in France \nwere arranged to form an earthly reflection of the constellation Virgo, \n\n\n\n891 \n\n\n\nSarama Sara-Kali\'s true home in heaven. 1 \' After being semi-Christianized, \n\nSaranyu gypsies identified Sara-Kali with the virgin Mary. Gypsies celebrated th \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin by piling up the heads \nof sacrificed fowls in front of her church, as Kali\'s votaries in India piled \nup the heads of sacrificed animals. 12 \n\nFurther Christianization inspired legends to provide Sara-Kali witl \na Christian background. Some claimed she was not a mother goddess \nbut a saint, the patron saint of the gypsy people. She accompanied the \nthree Marys from the foot of Jesus\'s cross on their sea voyage to the \nwest. They landed at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. Another story said \nSara-Kali was a gypsy queen from the Rhone delta, who swam from \nSaintes-Maries-de-la-Mer to meet the boat carrying Mary Salome, \nJoseph of Arimathea, Mary and Martha and their brother Lazarus, \nand other Christian celebrities, whose bones were displayed at the site \nthroughout the Middle Ages. 15 \n\nI.Keightley,20. 2.Esty,67. 3.

Like other Huntress-figures she symbolized the death- \ndealing function of the Goddess who implacably hunted down all whos \ntime of dissolution had come, according to the cycles of karma. \n\n1.0Tlaherty,352. \n\n\n\nSaranyu \n\nThe Vedic Goddess as a mare, mother of the Asvins or centaurs. Her \nwestern counterparts were Leukippe, Melanippe, Epona, or Mare- \nheaded Demeter. (See Horse.) Saranyu also gave birth to Yama and \nYami, the Lord of Death and Lady of Life, when she occupied the \nform of a woman instead of a mare. According to one story, Saranyu \ncreated a shadow-woman exactly like herself, and left this simulacrum \nwith her husband while she departed in the form of a mare. When \nher husband Vivasvat realized the deception, he turned himself into a \nstallion and followed her, as Poseidon became a stallion in order to \nmate with Mare-headed Demeter. However, Saranyu\'s mating took \nplace in a peculiar way. Vivasvat spilled his semen on the ground, \nand Saranyu snuffed some of it into her nostrils. In this way she became \npregnant, and later gave birth to the physician-gods, the Asvins, from \n\n\n\n892 \n\n\n\niher mouth. 1 The myth evidently came from an early period when the Sarapis \n\n(mechanism of impregnation was thought to be variable and the \n\norifice of birth not always exclusively genital. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nl.O\'Flaherty.61,69. \n\n\n\nSarapiS V ar. Serapis \n\ni Syncretic god worshipped as a supreme divinity in Egypt to the end \nof the 4th century a.d. The highly popular cult of Sarapis used many \ntrappings that were later adopted by Christians: chants, lights, bells, \nvestments, processions, music. \n\nSarapis represented a final transformation of the savior Osiris into a \nmonotheistic figure, virtually identical with the Christian God. The \n(religion of Sarapis was founded in the 3rd century B.C. by Ptolemy Soter \n((Ptolemy the Savior), the Macedonian pharaoh who identified him- \njself with the deity in traditional pharaonic style. 1 This Ptolemaic god \n(was a combination of Osiris and Apis, called Osarapis, or Sarapis. As \nChrist was a sacrificial lamb, so Sarapis was a sacrificial bull as well as a \ngod in human form. He was annually sacrificed in atonement for the \n[sins of Egypt, with the words: "If any evil be about to befall either those \nwho now sacrifice, or Egypt in general, may it be averted on this \nhead." 2 \n\nIn his later development, Sarapis picked up the qualities of every \nEgyptian deity and became both Father and Son, ruler and victim. \nHe was called lord of Death, Good Shepherd, creator, healer, sun, \nfertility god, impregnator of the Goddess his image carried in holy \nprocessions was a huge phallus. His greatest temple, the Sarapeum at \nAlexandria, was a cathedral of pilgrimage and medicine. The philoso- \npher Demetrius of Phalerum testified that Sarapis had cured him of \nblindness; his paeans to the god were still sung as hymns centuries \nlater. 3 Alexandrian psalms declared: "There is only one Zeus Sarapis." 4 \n\nSarapis became a great patron of arts and letters. The Sarapeum \nincluded a vast library of literary treasures from all over the Roman \nempire, a storehouse of contemporary learning. When Christianity \ncame to power in Alexandria, the library was attacked, though it was \ndesperately defended for three years. 5 Finally, in 389 a.d., Theodosius \ngave a direct order that the building must be wrecked and the books \nburned. Christians therefore destroyed the Sarapeum and its library, \nthus eliminating most of the ancient world\'s important literature in \none holocaust. 6 \n\nThe "deceased" pagan god was later assimilated into the canon as \nan artificial saint or saints. Among several Egyptian St. Sarapions, the \nmost notable was called a companion of St. Anthony, but a legend of his \nmartyrdom was constructed from the destruction of Sarapis\'s temple. \nThe late official canonization of St. Sarapion at the end of the 19th \n\n\n\n893 \n\n\n\nSarasvati century was based on an ecclesiastical literary hoax, the "discovery" \n\nSatan of some texts alleged to be copies of material in the lost Sarapean \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ library. 7 \n\nl.Cumont,A.R.G.R.,74. 2.

Sarasvati was also \nthe Queen of Heaven assimilated to Brahmanism as Brahma\'s wife, a \ncombination that suggests the biblical A-brahm and Sara(h). Sarasvati \nreally predated the cult of Brahma. She was said to have invented all \nthe arts of civilization: music, letters, mathematics, calendars, magic, the \nVedas, and all other branches of learning. Sometimes she bore the \nname of Savitri, listed by some scholars as a male god, even though \nancient records called Savitri "wife of Brahma" and "Daughter of the \nSun." 1 Frequently she was identified with the holy waters of Ganges. \n\n1.

Early Egyptians called \nhim the Great Serpent Sata, Son of the Earth, immortal because he was \nregenerated every day in the Goddess\'s womb. A man could become \' \nimmortal, like Sata, by repeating prayers to identify himself with the \ngod: "I am the serpent Sata, whose years are infinite. I lie down dead. I \nI am born daily. I am the serpent Sata, the dweller in the uttermost parts \nof the earth. I lie down in death. I am born. I become new, I renew \nmy youth every day." 1 \n\nSata seems to have been an underground aspect of the sun, Horus-s \nRa, corresponding to Apollo\'s underground serpent-form Python, \nwhom the Jews called Apollyon, Spirit of the Pit. He was a phallic \n\n\n\n894 \n\n\n\nconsort of the archaic Goddess Sati, or Setet, whose name was the Satan \n\nsame as that of a virgin aspect of Kali, and who once ruled Upper Egypt \n\nwhich was known as the Land of Sati. 2 The god was also called Set ^^^^^i \n\nthe biblical Seth, who may not have been immortal but did manage to \n\nlive 912 years (Genesis 5:8). \n\nThe snake\'s communion with the life-giving fountains of the deep \nwas still an important image in dynastic times, when Sata became the \nkeheret-snake, living in a yonic orifice in Isis\'s temple and giving oracles, \nlike Python at Delphi. It was felt that disasters would strike the \ncountry if the serpent should leave the Goddess\'s sacred hole. 5 \n\nThe serpent was often a symbol of the sun god\'s alter ego, the \nBlack Sun, spirit of night or of death. He combined with the solar disc \nas the god during his dark hours. The pattern was the same in Osiris- \nSet, Apollo-Python, Anu-Aciel, Baal-Yamm, etc. The dark god was \nthe light god\'s adversary not because he was originally viewed as evil, \nbut because he represented a sleeping or quiescent phase of the same \ngod. \n\nSata dwelling forever in the underworld reappeared in Russian folk \ntales as the great underground serpent Koshchei the Deathless. 4 In \nhis "adversary" role he eventually became the immortal Dragon whom \nthe sun-hero had to slay, as men wished to slay the spirit of death \ndwelling within their own bodies, the archetypal "betrayer" who led \nthem sooner or later to destruction. \n\nTo the Hebrews, a "satan" was an adversary in the sense of a \njudge: one who tested the faith of another by asking trick questions or \nposing problems to be solved. The "satan" first appears in the Bible as \none of the sons of God, advising God to test the faith of Job (Job 1:6). \nIn the original wording, Satan was one of the bene ha-elohim, sons of \n"the gods"; but Bible translators always singularized the plurals to \nconceal the fact that the biblical Jews worshipped a pantheon of \nmultiple gods. 5 \n\nThis "son of God" was identified with the lightning-serpent \nLucifer by the words of Jesus, who claimed to have seen Satan \ndescending into the earth as lightning (Luke 10:18). This repeated \nPersian myths concerning Ahriman, the lightning-serpent cast from \nheaven to the underworld by the god of light. Persians held that God \nand the Great Serpent were twin brothers, an idea that entered into \nGnostic tradition and led to medieval magic books that called upon \nSatan by the mystic names of God, such as Messias, Soter, Emman- \nuel, Saboth, Adonai (Messiah, Savior, Immanuel, Lord of Hosts, the \nLord). 6 \n\nSatan not only answered to God\'s names, he even assumed a \ndivine appearance when he wished. The medieval church insisted \nthat Satan "transfigures himself into an angel of light," so anyone \nclaiming an unofficial angelic vision could be charged with devil \nworship at the discretion of inquisitors who, naturally, always knew the \ndifference between a real angel and a devil in angelic disguise. 7 \n\n\n\n895 \n\n\n\nSati Islamic writers called Satan Shaytan, or Iblis. He governed the race \n\noidjinn, the "genies" who were once ancestral spirits, like the \n\n_^^^^^^^^ Roman genius. The djinn scorned Allah\'s prophets, so an army of \n\nangels attacked them, killed many, and took the rest prisoner. Among \nthe prisoners was Iblis-Shaytan, also called Azazel, to whom the Jews \nused to offer scapegoats on the Day of Atonement. Iblis-Shaytan had \nrebelled against Allah when Allah created Adam and ordered all the \nangels to worship his creation. Allah says in the Koran, "We said \nunto the Angels, Worship ye Adam, and they worshipped except Iblis \nwho was of the Jinn." 8 \n\nThe background of this story may have come from the early \nGnostic Gospel of Philip, which the church censored for obvious \nreasons: "Human beings make gods, and worship their creation. It \nwould be appropriate for the gods to worship human beings! " 9 \nSatan\'s worst offense seemed to be that he was not disposed to respect \nman, whose faults he well knew; nor did he have any good to say of \nGod, who had governed heaven too harshly and stimulated rebellion. \nMedieval Christians interpreted everything apart from their own \northodoxy as a manifestation of Satan-worship: astrology, magic, \npagan ceremonies, divination, etc. \n\nService of Satan is everything dealing with paganism, not only the \nsacrifices and the worship of idols and all the ceremonies involved in \ntheir service, according to the ancient custom, but also the things that have \ntheir beginning in it. Service of Satan is clearly that a person should \nfollow astrology and watch the positions and motions of the sun, the \nmoon, and the stars for the purpose of traveling, going forth, or \nundertaking a given work, while believing that he is benefited or harmed \nby their motion or their course; and that one should believe the men \nwho, after watching the motions of the stars, prognosticate by them. w \n\n1 .

Sometimes he was called Sun of Night. \n\nAt Harran, near old Edessa in what is now Turkey, Saturn\'s \nworship included the wearing of black clothing, and burning candles \nmade of incense, opium, goat\'s fat, and urine, with the prayer: "Lord, \nwhose name is august, whose power is widespread, whose spirit is \nsublime, O Lord Saturn the cold, the dry, the dark, the harmful . . . \ncrafty sire who knowest all wiles, who art deceitful, sage, understand- \ning, who causest prosperity or ruin, happy or unhappy is he whom thou \nmakest such." \' \n\nAs a rule the Lord of Death was both a god and a demon, like \nShiva the Destroyer.

"It was the universal practice in \nancient Italy, wherever the worship of Saturn prevailed, to choose a \nman who played the part and enjoyed all the traditionary privileges of \nSaturn for a season, and then died, whether by his own or another\'s \nhand, whether by the knife or the fire or on the gallows-tree, in the \ncharacter of the good god who gave his life for the world." 2 \n\nThough the real killing of the victim was gradually replaced by \nsymbolic killing, the festival was never abandoned, and in Christian \ntimes it became part of the midwinter Carnival. "The mock execution \nof King Carnival is a vestige of the ancient Saturnalia, when the man \nwho had acted as king of the revels was actually put to death at the end \nof his reign. This practice continued in parts of the Roman army well \ninto Christian times." 3 \n\nSaturn gave his name to Saturday, the sabbath of the week\'s end, \nbefore the coming of the new sun on Sun-day (Latin dies soli\'s). To \nthe Jews this was the seventh day when God "rested," like Saturn \nquiescent in darkness before the sun rose again. Saturn was identified \nwith the seventh planetary sphere, whose astrological influences partook \nof "saturnine" qualities such as somberness, heaviness, darkness, \npassivity, coldness, etc. \n\nThe Babylonian name of the planet Saturn was Ninip, which was \nalso a name of the underworld god: "the black Saturn, the ghost of \nthe dead sun, the demoniac elder god." 4 But Saturn was not altogether \n\n\n\n897 \n\n\n\nSavior demoniac. Like most chthonian deities, he was ambiguous. He was \n\noften revered as a healer. Our medicinal symbol Rx began as the \n\nplanetary sigil of Saturn, which was often written on paper and eaten \n\nas a cure for disease. 5 \n\nl.Cumont,A.R.G.R.,28,90. 2. Frazer, G.B., 679. 3.

Its literal meaning \nwas "one who sows the seed," i.e., a phallic god, like Rome\'s Semo \nSancus Holy Seed consort of Mother Earth. 1 After sowing or plant- \ning, the Soter was "born again" in the new grain as a Divine Child, \nand his advent was hailed with the formula, "He is risen." 2 \n\nIt was usual for the Savior to sow his "seed" three times, like the \nPersian Messiah who spilled his seed three times into the womb of \nMother Earth (Hvov). 3 At Eleusis the savior Iasion bore the title of \nTriptolemus, "Three Plowings," ostensibly because he lay with \nMother Demeter "in a thrice-plowed field"; but the field was Demeter \nherself, as Mother Earth, and the Savior was the plow. 4 Ptolemy, the \nroyal name of the Macedonian line of Egyptian pharaohs, meant \n"plower" or "sower," like the Greek Soter. 5 \n\nSince most kings were gods made flesh, many bore the title of \nSavior. Antiochus Soter (Antiochus the Savior) ruled Babylon from \n280 to 260 b.c, and was identified with the sacrificial god Nabu, \n"exalted Son, powerful leader of the gods." 6 In 48 B.C., Julius Caesar \nwas hailed as "God made manifest and universal Savior of human life." \nHis successor Augustus was "Ancestral God and Savior of the whole \nhuman race." 7 The emperor Nero was immortalized on his coins as \n"Savior of Mankind." 8 Roman emperors were routinely deified and \nmade "saviors," as shown by the address prepared for the birthday \ncelebration of Augustus in 9 b.c. \n\nThis day has given earth an entirely new aspect. The world would have \ngone to destruction had not there streamed forth from him who is now \nborn a common blessing. Rightly does he judge who recognized in this \nbirthday the beginning of life and of all the powers of life. . . . The \nprovidence which rules over all has filled this man with such gifts for the \nsalvation of the world as designate him the Savior for us for the coming \ngeneration: of wars he will make an end, and establish all things worthily. \nBy his appearing are the hopes of our forefathers fulfilled: not only has \nhe surpassed the good deeds of men of earlier times, but it is impossible \nthat one greater than he can ever appear. The birthday of God has \nbrought to the world glad tidings that are bound up in him. From this \nbirthday a new era begins. 9 \n\n\n\nSuch speeches were often copied by followers of less exalted \n\n\n\n898 \n\n\n\n"saviors," of which the early Christian era had many, especially in the \nMiddle East. "Palestine was seething with eschatological (i.e., salva- \ntional) movements. . . . [T]he emergence of the Christian sect was \nanything but an isolated incident." One of the greatest problems of \nearly Christianity was to decide what the savior was supposed to be \nsaving humanity from. Among the many theories put forth were: \nChrist saved mankind from (1) death, or (2) sin, or (3) demons, or (4) \nthe fleshly world and its evil demiurge. 10 \n\nCelsus quoted a typical speech of the kind of self-styled savior \ncurrently prevalent in his day: \n\nlam God (or a son of God, or a divine Spirit). And I have come. Already \nthe world is being destroyed. And you, O men, are to perish because of \nyour iniquities. But I wish to save you. And you see me returning again \nwith heavenly power. Blessed is he who has worshipped me now! But I \nwill cast everlasting fire upon all the rest, both on cities and on country \nplaces. And men who fail to realize the penalties in store for them will \nin vain repent and groan. But I will preserve for ever those who have been \nconvinced by me. " \n\nGnostics believed in a Buddhistic succession of saviors. Some \nGnostic leaders said "the savior does not come just once into the world \nbut that from the beginning of time he wanders in different forms \nthrough history." n The belief of Jewish Essenes in a savior of this type \nprobably contributed to the medieval legend of the Wandering Jew. \n\n1.

O\'Flaherty, 49-50; Lurousse, 344. \n\n\n\nScold \n\nProbably derived from Skuld (Skadi), the Norse Goddess of cursing, \nthird of the Norns, who spoke the deadly words that condemned every \n\n\n\n899 \n\n\n\nScorpion man to death sooner or later. Even after Christianity discredited \n\nSkuld, men continued to believe that women\'s curses had effective \n\n^^^^^^^^^ power to injure them, to cause bad luck, disease, or death. \n\nCertainly Christian laws displayed fear of women\'s maledictions. \nMen were permitted to curse women, but a woman could be jailed or \ntortured for "scolding" a man. In England, "a common scold" was \nconsidered a criminal, like a thief. The ducking stool, frequently used \nto drown witches, was also used to punish a scold. 1 \n\nIn 1632 the English brought from Scotland an instrument of \ntorture called a brank, or "scold\'s bridle": an iron head-cage with a \ntongue piece to be inserted in the mouth, the cage being locked around \nthe head. Sometimes the tongue piece was shaped like a spoon; \nsometimes it was a sharp spike. A brank with four sharp spikes, two to \npierce the tongue and two to pierce the cheeks, was used to fasten the \n"witch" Agnes Sampson to the wall of her cell, as part of the torment to \nmake her confess to the crime of witchcraft. 2 \n\nThe brank was still in use as a punishment for "scolding" women \nup to the middle of the 19th century. In 1856 a woman locked into \none of these devices was paraded from the town cross to the church at \nBolton-le-Moors, in Lancashire. 3 \n\n1. Hazlitt, 158. 2. Robbing, 359. 3.

Scorpio was the same in Babylonia, India, and Greece; and \nthe Maya of Yucatan also called the same constellation "scorpion \nstars." 1 \n\nAstrological myths everywhere placed Aquarius the Water-drawer \nat the winter solstice, Taurus the Bull at the spring equinox, Leo the \nLion at the summer solstice, and Scorpio at the autumnal equinox. 2 \nTherefore it was said in Egypt that the Scorpion killed Horus, the \nsun, sending him to his midwinter death and resurrection as his Mother \nIsis gave him rebirth; and Pharaoh\'s daughter apparently played the \npart of the Water-drawer or divine midwife on the banks of the Nile, as \nshown by the myth of Moses. \n\nSpirits of the four points of the year were sometimes called Sons of \nHorus, and placed as small images in the four corners of a pharaoh\'s \ntomb. As man, bull, lion, and scorpion (or serpent) they were adopted \nby Christianity and converted into the four totems of the evangelists \nand the four angels of the Apocalypse. \n\n1.

Budge, G.E. 1,341. ^^^^ mm ^^^^ amam \n\n\n\nSerpent \n\nIt was a general belief in the ancient world that snakes don\'t die of old \nage like other animals, but periodically shed their skins and emerge \nrenewed or reborn into another life. Greeks called the snake\'s cast \nskin geras, "old age." The Chinese envisioned resurrection of the dead \nas a man splitting his old skin and coming out of it as a youth again, \nlike a snake. Melanesians say "to slough one\'s skin" means eternal life. \nA basic serpent-myth said the dual Moon-goddess of life and death \nmade the first man. Her bright aspect suggested making him immortal \nlike a snake, able to shed his skin; but her dark aspect insisted that he \nshould die and be buried in the earth. 1 Eternal life and serpenthood are \nstill equated in the Italian expression averpiu annid\'un serpente \n"being older than a serpent." \n\nThe ageless serpent was originally identified with the Great \nGoddess herself. Hinduism\'s Ananta the Infinite was the serpent- \nmother who embraced Vishnu and other gods during their "dead" \nphase. 2 She was also Kundalini, the inner female soul of man in serpent \nshape, coiled in the pelvis, induced through proper practice of yoga to \nuncoil and mount through the spinal chakras toward the head, bringing \ninfinite wisdom. The Serpent-goddess occupied the famous Khmer \ntemple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia where she embraced the king every \nnight. If one night the Goddess did not appear, it was a sign that the \nking must be killed and a new king chosen. 3 \n\nThe Negritos said the divine people called Chinoi (Chinese) were \ndescended from a mighty Serpent-goddess named Mat Chinoi, \nMother of the Chinese. In her belly lived beautiful angels who received \nthe souls of the dead. Since her womb was Paradise, shamans \nunderwent their death-and-rebirth initiations by entering the serpent\'s \nbelly. 4 \n\nThe ancient Aegean world worshipped primarily women and \nserpents. Men didn\'t participate in religious ceremonies until late in \nthe Bronze Age, when Cretan kings were allowed to become priests of \nthe bull-god. Even then, the priest\'s role was subordinate to that of \nthe priestess, until the priest himself took the title of "serpent." 5 The \nword for "priest" among ancient Akkadian peoples literally meant \n"snake charmer." 6 \n\nThe Indian Serpent-goddess Kadru gave birth to all the Nagas or \ncobra people, and made them immortal by feeding them her divine \nlunar blood. 7 She had a Babylonian counterpart, the Goddess Kadi of \nDer, worshipped as a serpent with a woman\'s head and breasts. 8 Her \nchildren like the Nagas were depicted as water-serpents, human from \n\n\n\n903 \n\n\n\nSefpent \n\n\n\nBookofThoth \n\nLegendary Egyptian \nmagical text sup- \nposed to have been \nwritten by the god \nThoth, found in the ne- \ncropolis at Memphis \nby a young prince \nnamed Satni- \nKhamois. \n\nMagic Papyri Col- \nlections of exorcisms, \ninvocations, charms, \nand spells widely circu- \nlated during the early \nChristian era, used as \nbases for later gri- \nmoires and Hermetic \ntexts. \n\n\n\nMahabharata Indi- \nan epic poem, \nconsisting of histori- \ncal and legendary \nmaterial gathered be- \ntween the 4th and 10th \ncenturies a.d., in- \ncluding the famous \nBhagavad-Gita. \n\n\n\nthe waist up, like mermaids and mermen. The Nagas guarded "great \ntreasures of wealth and precious stones, and sometimes books of secret \nteachings in underwater palaces." 9 \n\nA similar serpent guarded the wonderful Book of Thoth, which \nwas hidden in an underwater palace. 10 Like his Greek twin Hermes, \nThoth was often incarnate in a snake, signifying his magical wisdom. \nEgypt agreed with India in depicting the first serpent as a totemic \nform of the Great Mother herself. Egypt\'s archaic Mother of Creation \nwas a serpent, Per-Uatchet or Buto. The Egyptian uraeus-snake was \na hieroglyphic sign for "Goddess." " Incongruously, "Uraeus" later \nbecame one of the most popular "secret names of God" listed in \nMagic Papyri and medieval texts of sorcery. \n\nEgypt\'s Serpent-goddess also had the title of Mehen the Envel- \nopes similar to Kundalini or Ananta. Each night, Mehen enfolded \nthe ram-headed god Auf-Ra (Phallus of Ra) during his sojourn in the \nuterine underworld. This was a mythic image of the king\'s sexual \nunion with his Goddess, reminiscent of the custom of Angkor Wat. 12 At \nPhilae, the Serpent-goddess received the title of Anqet, from anq, to \nsurround, to embrace. 13 "Serpent of the Nile" was the title, not only of \nCleopatra, but of all Egyptian queens who represented the nation and \nthe Goddess embracing the king. \n\nThe birth-and-death Goddesses Isis and Nephthys became identi- \nfied with the dual Serpent-mother of life and after-life. Only they \ncould help the soul through the section of the underworld inhabited by \nserpent deities, Egypt\'s version of the Nagas. 14 The Mahabharata \ndepicts a hero seeking immortality in a similar underworld called "city of \nserpents," where the dual Mother of Life and Death wove the web of \nnights and days with black and white thread, binding them with the red \nthread of life. 15 \n\nThe Akkadian Goddess Ninhursag, "She Who Gives Life to the \nDead," was also called "Mistress of Serpents" as yet another form of \nKadru or Kadi. 16 Babylon\'s version of her made her a dark twin of the \nHeaven-goddess Ishtar, calling her Lamia or Lamashtu, "Great \nLady, Daughter of Heaven." Cylinder seals showed her squatting, Kali- \nlike, over her mate, the god Pazuzu, he of the serpent penis. 17 As \nanother Lord of Death, he gave himself up to be devoured by the \nGoddess. The image of the male snake deity enclosed or devoured by \nthe female gave rise to a superstitious notion about the sex life of snakes, \nreported by Pliny and solemnly believed in Europe even up to the \n20th century: that the male snake fertilizes the female snake by putting \nhis head in her mouth and letting her eat him. 18 \n\nThe male serpent deity became the phallic consort of the Great \nMother, sometimes a "father" of races, because he was the Mother\'s \noriginal mate. In some myths, he was no more than a living phallus she: \ncreated for her own sexual pleasure. In other myths, she allowed him \nto take part in the work of creation or to fertilize her world-producing \nwomb. When the serpent-creator turned arrogant and tried to pre- \n\n\n\n904 \n\n\n\ntend that he alone made the universe, the Goddess punished him, Serpent \n\nbruising his head with her heel and banishing him to the under- \nworld. 19 On this version of the creation myth the Jews based their ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \nnotion of Eve\'s progeny bruising the serpent\'s head, and the rabbini- \ncal opinion that the serpent was Eve\'s first lover and the true father of \nCain. 20 \n\nActually, the serpent was worshipped in Palestine long before \nYahweh\'s cult arose. Early Hebrews adopted the serpent-god all their \ncontemporaries revered, and the Jewish priestly clan of Levites were \n"sons of the Great Serpent," i.e., of Leviathan, "the wriggly one." 21 \nHe was worshipped in combination with his Goddess, the moon. 22 The \nBible shows that Yahweh was a hostile rival of the serpent Leviathan, \nfor the two gods battled each other (Psalms 74:14; 89:10, Isaiah 5 1:9). \nThey would engage in another final battle at doomsday (Isaiah 27: 1 ; \nRevelation 12). \n\nAnother Jewish name for the Great Serpent was Nehushtan, \ndescribed as the god of Moses. Hebrew nahash, "serpent," descended \nfrom an ancient Vedic serpent-king, Nahusha, once "the supreme ruler \nof heaven," until he was cast down to the underworld by a rival. 23 \nNehushtan was the same god whose image Moses made: a "fiery \nserpent" according to Numbers 21:8. The Israelites worshipped him \nuntil the reign of Hezekiah, when the new priesthood "cut down the \ngroves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made" \n(2 Kings 18:4). \n\nYet serpent worship continued in Israel. Seraph, the Hebrew word \nfor the divine fiery serpent, used to mean an earth-fertilizing light- \nning-snake, and later became an angel. 24 The seraphim were originally \nserpent-spirits, like those of the caduceus created by Hermes the \nGreat Serpent and copied by Mosaic tradition. Jewish medallions of the \n1st and 2nd centuries B.C. represented Jehovah as a serpent god, like \nthe "snake-tailed winds" of the Greeks. 25 Jews of Asia Minor said their \nJehovah was the same as Zeus Sabazius the serpent god of Phrygia. 26 \nSome Jewish Gnostics early in the Christian era maintained that the \npost-exilic Jehovah was no god, but a devil, the usurper of the original \nKingdom of the Wise Serpent. 27 \n\nMuch Gnostic literature praised the serpent of Eden for bring- \ning the "light" of knowledge to humanity, against the will of a tyrannical \nGod who wanted to keep humans ignorant. 28 This view of the Eden \nmyth dated back to Sumero-Babylonian sources that said man was made \nby the Earth Mother out of mud and placed in the garden "to dress it \nand to keep it" (Genesis 2:1 5) for the gods, because the gods were too \nlazy to do their own farming and wanted slaves to plant, harvest, and \ngive them offerings. 29 The gods agreed that their slaves should never \nlearn the godlike secret of immortality, lest they get above themselves \nand be ruined for work. Therefore, as the Epic of Gilgamesh reports, \nthe gods gave death to humanity, and "Life they kept in their own \nhands." 50 \n\n\n\n905 \n\n\n\nSerpent \n\n\n\nHypostasis of the \nArchons ("Reality of \nthe Rulers") A \nGnostic Gospel written \nabout the 3rd centu- \nry A.D., incorporating \none of the alternate \nversions of the Adam \nand Eve myth. \n\n\n\nIn one of the interwoven Genesis stories, God was not one but \nmany, the elohim or "gods-and-goddesses." 31 The God of Eden \nremarked to his divine colleagues, "Behold, the man is become as one \nof us, to know good and evil"; therefore he must be ejected from the \ngarden at once, lest he "take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for \never" (Genesis 3:22). The serpent\'s teachings would have led man to \nconquer death and become godlike, against the will of the elohim. \n\nThe Hypostasis of the Archons showed that the serpent was a \ntotemic form of the Goddess, apparently taking pity on her doomed \ncreature and seeking to instruct him in the attainment of eternal life: \n"The Female Spiritual Principle came in the Snake, the Instructor, \nand it taught them, saying, \'y u sna H not die; for it was out of jealousy \nthat he said this to you. Rather, your eyes shall open, and you shall \nbecome like gods, recognizing evil and good.\' " Then "the arrogant \nRuler" (God) cursed the serpent and the woman. 52 Some Gnostic \nsects honored both Eve and the serpent for their efforts on behalf of \nhumanity. 33 \n\nThe present form of the biblical story is obviously a much-revised \nversion of the original tales of the Great Mother and her serpent. \nBabylonian icons showed the Goddess attended by her snake, offering \nman the food of immortality. The Pyramid Texts said it was the \nserpent who offered the food of eternal life. 34 As Ophion, or Ophi, he \nwas the ancestor of the African serpent god Obi, whose name is still \npreserved in the voodoo-magic system, oheah?^ The Bible uses a \nHebrew version of the name, obh, for the familiar spirit of the Witch \nof Endor, and the Vulgate renders this word "python." 36 In Dahomey, \nthe primal Mother-Creatress Mawu was supported by a Great \nSerpent. 37 \n\nGnostic accounts of the Eden myth used the Aramaic pun \nidentifying Eve, the Teacher, and the Serpent: Hawah, Mother of \nAll Living; hawa, to instruct; and hewya, Serpent. 38 Eve\'s name in \nArabic still combines the idea of "life" (hayyat) with the name of the \nserpent (Hayyat). 39 Hippolytus viewed the serpent as a feminine Logos, \n"the wise Word of Eve. This is the mystery of Eden: this is the river \nthat flows out of Eden. This is also the mark that was set on Cain, whose \nsacrifice the God of this world did not accept whereas he accepted \nthe bloody sacrifice of Abel: for the lord of this world delights in blood. \nThis Serpent is he who appeared in the latter days in human form at \nthe time of Herod." * \n\nArabian tradition identified the food of immortality with the female \nuterine blood, colored "royal purple"; and the Mother\'s uterine \ngarden with the moon temple at Marib in Sheba. Legend said the \nserpents of Sheba were purple with the divine essence, and lived in \ntrees; the people were serpentlike, with forked tongues, great wisdom, \nand longevity. 41 From Sheba might have come the mysterious life- \ngiving substance called shiba in the Epic of Gilgamesh, dispensed by the \nwife of Uta-Napishtim (Noah), who had become the only immortal \n\n\n\n906 \n\n\n\nman; his wife therefore was a Goddess. When this holy matriarch gave Serpent \n\nshiba to Gilgamesh, he shed his old, diseased skin like a snake, and \n\nemerged from it reborn. 42 ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nPersians also maintained the symbolic connections between men- \nstrual blood and the serpent\'s secret of longevity. Mithraists claimed \nimmortality was conferred by the blood of the sacrificial bull, but a \nserpent was there to collect the blood as it flowed from the bull\'s \nbody; and this blood was imitation-menstrual blood in that it was \n"delivered by the moon." 43 \n\nImmortality was the special province of the skin-shedding Serpent \nand the blood-bestowing Goddess from earliest times. Some of the \nvery oldest traditions of the Great Serpent identified him with the \nEarth\'s intestines. Archaic serpent gods like Egyptian Apep and \nSumerian Khumbaba were said to "resemble intestines." 44 In this \nconnection, the biblical phrase for birth or rebirth was "separation \nfrom the bowels." Serpents understood how to restore life to the dead, \naccording to the myths of Crete, where the sorcerer Polyidos learned \nthe serpents\' secret and won great honor at the Minoan court by \nbringing the dead prince Glaucus back to life. 45 \n\nMany Gnostic traditions identified the Serpent with Jesus. In the \nPistis Sophia, Jesus was the serpent who spoke to Eve "from the tree \nof knowledge and the tree of life, which were in the paradise of Adam." \nJewish Naassians (Serpent-worshippers) said the serpent was the \nMessiah. Magic Papyri called him "World Ruler, the Great Serpent, \nleader of gods ... the god of gods." 46 Some Christians held that the \nserpent was the father of Jesus, having "overshadowed" the bed of the \nvirgin Mary and begotten the human form of the Savior. \n\nThese traditions were still extant, though hidden, in Renaissance \ntimes. Barrel Bruyn\'s Gnostic-symbolic painting of the Annunciation \nshowed an unmistakably Hermetic serpent-caduceus as the rod extend- \ned toward Mary by the impregnating angel Gabriel. The Dove \npoised in a halo in its tip, making a sign like a cross between a fairy-wand \nand the emblem of Venus. 47 This made a combined symbol of the \nmale-and-female mystery of the Serpent and Dove, which was inserted \ninto the mouth of Jesus according to Matthew 10:16. Many theolo- \ngians claimed the crucified serpent Nehushtan was a prophecy of Jesus: \n"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must \nthe Son of Man be lifted up" (John 3:1 5). In the 16th century, German \nsmiths made golden thalers with a crucified Christ on one side and a \ncrucified serpent on the other, hinting that they were two faces of the \nsame redeemer. 48 \n\nEvery mythology had some form of the World Serpent. Like the \nHermetic or Gnostic serpent encircling the World Egg, he was a \nbasic Indo-European religious symbol. Norse myth called him the \nMidgard-Worm, who encircled the whole round of Middle-Earth \n(Midgard), his tail in his mouth. 49 Russians called him Koshchei the \nDeathless, encircler of the underworld. 50 This seems to have been a \n\n\n\n907 \n\n\n\nSerpent \n\n\n\nvariation of the Japanese dragon of sea-tides, Koshi. 51 Egyptians called \nhim Sata (Satan), or the Tuat, on whose back the sun god rode \nthrough the underworld each night. Greeks called him Okeanos, the \nsea-serpent of the outermost ocean. \n\nOften the Heavenly Father assumed this serpent form, like Zeus \nMeilichios, worshipped as a gigantic serpent in the 4th century B.C. 52 \nIn the shape of a serpent he became the consort of chthonian Perseph- \none." He also begot heroes on mortal women. Alexander the Great \nwas allegedly fathered by God who in the form of a serpent impreg- \nnated his mother, Queen Olympias. 54 \n\nThe Pyramid Texts spoke of the serpent as both subterranean and \ncelestial. In his heavenly aspect, he was a dispenser of immortality. 55 \nAs the divine phallus in perpetual erection he was the Tree of Life, or \naxis mundi, a Pole passing through the center of heaven and earth \nthat is, Father Heaven coupled to the Goddess\'s "hub." His eye was \nseen as the pole star. In 3000 B.C., the pole star was Alpha Draconis, \nthe Serpent\'s Eye. 56 \n\nThe Mahabharata said the pole star to which the yoke of the world \nwas fixed was "the supreme snake, Vasuki." The same snake was the \nphallic god who stirred the uterine Abyss at creation, according to the \nVedas. 57 Like the God of Genesis, the Vedic deity Indra claimed to \nhave cast down the Great Serpent from heaven into the world- \nencircling abyss of the outer ocean. 58 Like the Bible story, this myth \nre-interpreted the original meaning of the serpent as a descending, \nfertilizing phallus. \n\nThe sexual image of the phallic serpent\'s head as the Jewel in the \nLotus ramified into many versions of the myth of menarche: the \nbelief that menstruation was initiated by copulation with a supernatural \nsnake (see Menstrual Blood). According to this imagery, the divine \nmale serpent acquired a "blood-red jewel" in his head. Hindus said all \nthe great snakes carried blood-red rubies of immortality in their \nheads. 59 \n\nGermans remembered this Aryan lore, and said a serpent with a \nmagic stone in its head would be found at the root of a hazel tree \nwitchwood near mistletoe. The serpent\'s stone was sacred to the \nmoon, and was identified with the Philosopher\'s Stone, which could \nbring eternal life. 60 Remnants of the serpent\'s phallic symbolism \nappeared in medieval magic charms, such as the conviction that "female \ndiseases" could be cured by applying to the sufferer a staff with which \na snake had been beaten. 61 \n\nIn 13th-century France, a snake on a pole like the Ophites\' image \nof Christ was carried in triumphal procession during Easter Week to \nthe baptismal font of the church. 62 Sometimes the fetish was an \nenormous stuffed serpent, like a Chinese carnival dragon. Church- \nmen tried to assimilate the custom by saying the serpent was the devil \n"driven from his kingdom by the Passion of Christ"; but this was but \n\n\n\n908 \n\n\n\na lame explanation for a rite that was already old when Christianity was \nnew. 63 \n\nEarly Ophite Christians adopted serpent worship and claimed \nMoses as the founder of their sect, alleging that Moses taught the \nJews to worship the serpent in the wilderness. 64 Besides, the serpent had \ncertainly given knowledge to Adam and Eve, and therefore was a \nsavior of humanity, an earlier incarnation of Christ who also suffered at \nGod\'s hands for the enlightenment he brought. The Ophites\' holy \nserpents were made to twine around the bread of the Eucharist, and \nwere adored hanging on crosses. Ophite "colleges" still existed in \nBithynia in the 5th century a.d., when bishops began leading mobs to \nwreck the Ophite churches. 65 \n\nMedieval Hermetists worshipped the serpent as Ouroboros, king of \nmagic, a syncretic mixture of the Ophites\' Christ-Ophion, the \nGreeks\' Hermes, the Phoenicians\' Taaut, the Egyptians\' Tuat, and \nother ancient snake-tailed gods including the underground oracle \nPython. 66 Ouroboros was linked with the Chinese p;-dragon, symbol of \nthe universe, carved on jade discs as a dragon or serpent eating its \nown tail. 67 This may have been the prototype of the serpent Python and \nthe Pythagoreans\' worship ofp/as the mystic numerical principle of \nthe circle. Two serpents eating each other\'s tails combined the yang- \nand-yin mandala with the caduceus, expressing the bisexual nature of \nHermes and all cyclic alternations: birth/death, summer/winter, light/ \ndark, etc. The Ouroboros was still pictured under the earth in certain \nEuropean areas, and some people claimed to be able to feel his slow \nmovements through their feet when they stood in the ancient shrines. \n\nl.Briffault 2, 643-48. 2.

Dr. Joseph Fletcher of the Episcopal Theological School wrote, \n"The Christian churches must shoulder much of the blame for the \nconfusion, ignorance, and guilt which surrounds sex in Western \nculture [T]he Christian church, from its earliest primitive begin- \nnings, had been swayed by many Puritanical people, both Catholic \nand Protestant, who have viewed sex as inherently evil." \' \n\nOthers have been less forgiving, and stated bluntly that Christian \nchurches must shoulder not just "much of the blame, but all of it. \nR.E.L. Masters declared, "Almost the entire blame for the hideous \nnightmare that was the witch mania, and the greatest part of the \nblame for poisoning the sexual life of the West, rests squarely on the \nRoman Catholic Church." 2 The rest of the blame presumably \ndevolves upon Protestantism, for there was no institution in western \nculture other than Christianity that made any effort to teach human \nbeings to hate or fear sex. \n\nChristian abhorrence of sex began with the fathers of the church, \nwho insisted that the kingdom of God couldn\'t be established until \nthe human race was allowed to die out through universal celibacy. 5 \nMarcion announced that all propagation must be abandoned at once. \nSt. Jerome ordered: "Regard everything as poison which bears within it \nthe seed of sensual pleasure." 4 St. Athanasius declared the great \nrevelation and blessing brought by Jesus was knowledge of the saving \n\n\n\n910 \n\n\n\ngrace of chastity. 5 Tertullian said chastity was "a means whereby a \nman will traffic in a mighty substance of sanctity," whereas the sex act \nrendered even marriage "obscene." 6 \n\nNumenius of Apamea proclaimed that only total cessation of all \nsexual activity could bring about the union of the soul with God. 7 St. \nAugustine pronounced the doctrine that "concupiscence" is the root of \noriginal sin and the means of transmitting Adam\'s guilt to all \ngenerations. Thus he sealed the church\'s commitment to asceticism, at \nleast in theory, for the next 1600 years. 8 Augustine said sexual \nintercourse is never sinless, even within marriage. 9 Augustine didn\'t \ninvent this doctrine. He got it from Gnostic Manicheans, to whose \nsect he belonged before his conversion to orthodoxy. Gnostics taught \nthat souls are entrapped in flesh by "the mystery of love and lust, \nthrough which all the worlds are inflamed." This teaching probably \ncame ultimately from ascetic Jain Buddhist yogis, who enjoined the \nsame precept as the First Book of John: "Love not the world, neither \nthings that are in the world ... for all that is in the world, the lust of \nthe flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the \nFather." 10 \n\nThese views became more entrenched as time went on. Medieval \ntheologians said sex "caused the damnation of humanity, which was \non its account put out of Paradise, and for its sake Christ was killed." 1 1 \nOfficials of the Inquisition taught in their handbooks that women\'s \n"carnal lust" was the cause of witchcraft and Satanism, since God \n"allows the devil more power over the venereal act, by which the \noriginal sin is handed down, than over all other human actions . . . \nbecause of its natural nastiness." 12 \n\nThe church promulgated legends about saints so devoted to \nchastity that they preferred extreme physical torment to sexual \npleasure. St. Paul the Hermit was tied down by the wicked emperor \nDecius and subjected to the lascivious caresses of a harlot. As soon as \nhe felt his penis rise, "having no weapon with which to defend himself, \n[he] bit off his tongue and spat it into the face of the lewd woman." \nThe sainted Pope Leo was so pure that when "a woman kissed his \nhand, and aroused in him a violent temptation of the flesh," he cut \nhis hand off. By singular good fortune it was restored by the Holy Virgin \nso he could continue to perform religious ceremonies. 13 \n\nThe early church attacked most bitterly the many pagan faiths \nthat made sex a central holy sacrament, enacting union of the Great \nGoddess and her phallic consorts. Tertullian denounced "the whore- \ndoms of Eleusis," and Eusebius condemned "the unnameable rites of \nthe mysteries, adulteries and yet baser lusts." Yet Plato and his \ncontemporaries had worshipped Eros, god of sexual love, as "the most \nvenerable of the deities, the most worthy of honor, the most powerful \nto grant virtue and blessedness unto mankind both in life and after \ndeath." 14 \n\nFrom the most primitive period, European pagans incorporated \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nNumenius of Apa- \nmea Neopythagorean \nand Platonic philoso- \npher, born in Syria \nduring the 2nd cen- \ntury a.d.; influential in \nthe school of \nPlotinus. \n\n\n\n911 \n\n\n\nSex sex into their religion. The word Lust in old Germanic languages \n\nmeant "religious joy." 15 At their holy feasts, Norsemen sang songs the \n^^^^^^^^^^_ Christians called "lewd and shameful," and danced hip-swinging \n\ndances the Christians called "female gyrations." 16 The people refused \nto give these up, believing them essential to general fertility. When \nseasons went awry and crops failed under the first Christianized kings, \nthe peasants were sure the cause was neglect of the old deities\' rites. 17 \nSexuality was reverenced in cultures where the female principle \nwas accorded freedom and honor, as in Egypt, where women chose \nand wooed their lovers at will. 18 Egyptians described carnal knowledge \nas "knowing a woman perfectly," and regarded it as a joy. Sages \ncounseled men never to be rude to a mistress or wife, nor to try to order \nher about; it would be unseemly in one with whom she shared \n"joy." 19 This was like the Tantric identification of sexual bliss with the \nbliss of the Goddess and God as they continually engendered life in \nthe universe. 20 Hindus said intercourse with any woman is like union \nwith the Goddess herself. Far from being sinful, "to have carnal \nintercourse with the Goddess Parvati is a virtue which destroys all sin." 21 \n\nBut in the Christian view, woman brought death into the world \nand sex perpetuated it. 22 It was claimed that Adam was made to be \nimmortal, but he lost both his innocence and his immortality when Eve \ntaught him about sex. All women were copies of Eve, said Tertullian; \n"the unsealer of that Tree," her very existence bringing destruction to \n"God\'s image, man." 25 Women were dangerous even when dead. \nAn early church edict ordered that a male corpse must not be buried \nnext to a female corpse until the latter was safely decomposed. 24 \n\nSt. John Chrysostom said a man "cannot endure" looking at a \nwoman. 25 A biographer of St. Augustine assumed automatically that \n"because of his great holiness, he was unwilling to look upon a woman\'s \nface." 26 St. Augustine\'s doctrine of original sin was destined to \ncrucify not only Christ but the whole of the western world with its anti- \npleasure, pro-pain philosophy. 27 Even today it is hardly possible for \nanyone brought up in one of the western nations to comprehend the \nancient world\'s opinion of sex as an experience of divine pleasure or a \npreview of heaven, without deliberate, laborious intellectual progress \ntoward such an opinion. \n\nNot only was Europe crucified by Christian antisexuality but also \nmuch of Oceania, Africa, and the Far East. Wherever Christian \nmissionaries went which was everywhere people were told their \nown generally healthy sexual attitudes were wrong and sinful. One \nmissionary described Bantu harvest festivals as Bacchic feasts: "It is \nimpossible to witness them without being ashamed. Men and wom- \nen, who in ordinary circumstances are modest in behavior and speech, \nthen abandon themselves to licentiousness." Another missionary \nwrote: "I have seen the most indelicate performances in the shape of \ndances or theatrical pieces in front of the Badago temples, and on \nbearing witness to their wickedness have been told that the god \ndelighted in them." 28 \n\n\n\n912 \n\n\n\nA missionary in Malaya observed that the natives engaged in all of \nwhat he called the carnal sins except one: rape. 29 He didn\'t follow up \nthe thought to the prevalence of rape in his own society; but today\'s \npsychologists are beginning to understand the leading role played by \nsexual repression in developing the kind of woman-hatred that leads to \nrape. Western thinkers have only recently caught on to the fact that \ncultural suppression of the need for bodily pleasure will inevitably result \nin perverted expression through cruelty. 50 \n\nCruelty to both women and children was the early Christian \nsubstitute for the affection usually shown them in less ascetic societ- \nies. The Apostolic Constitutions called for severe physical punishment \nof children. Fathers (not mothers) were told: "Do not hesitate to \nreprove them, chastening them with severity. . . . Teach your children \nthe word of the Lord, straiten them even with stripes and render \nthem submissive, teaching them from infancy the Holy Scriptures." 31 \n\nRecent experiments have shown that inhibition of sexual responses \n(in animals) is associated with aggressive cruelty, whereas sexual \npermissiveness goes with peaceful co-existence. While some investiga- \ntors theorized that aggression and lust rise together from a common \nsource, experiments don\'t support this belief. Instead, it seems one \nalternative inhibits the other. 32 Christianity made all Europe a vast \nexperiment in sexual inhibition, with predictable results. In one of \nhistory\'s most cruel ages, Thomas Browne spoke of a nearly total \nrejection of sex: "I would be content that we might procreate like trees, \nwithout conjunction, or that there were any other way to perpetuate \nthe World without this trivial and vulgar way of union." 33 \n\nIn 1721 Beaumont ordered the pious to reject any and all \nsensual pleasures, even the most subtle or involuntary ones: \n\nIf ye perceive a sudden sweet taste in your mouths or feel any warmth in \nyour breasts, like tire, or any form of pleasure in any part of your body, \nor . . . if ye become aware by occasion of pleasure or satisfaction derived \nfrom such perception, that your hearts are drawn away from the \ncontemplation of Jesus Christ and from spiritual exercises . . . then this \nsensation is very much to be suspected of coming from the Enemy; and \ntherefore were it ever so wonderful and striking, still renounce it and do \nnot consent to accept it. ** \n\nInhibition of sensual impulses was the keynote of western \nmorality up to and including the I9th century, when Dr. Alcott \nauthoritatively stated that even marital sex should never be indulged \nmore than once a month. Any greater frequency was "prostitution of \nthe matrimonial life." 35 For many centuries the church insisted that \nmarital sex should be as barren of sensual pleasure as possible, and that \norgasms in women were unseemly or even devilish. The "missionary \nposition" was the only permitted sexual position, because it afforded the \nleast pleasure, especially to the wife. \n\nIn consequence of such socialization, "good" women were fre- \nquently sex-haters. Bertrand Russell said of his first wife that "she had \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nApostolic Consti- \ntutions Short title of \nthe Ordinances of \nthe Holy Apostles \nThrough Clement, \nforged documents pur- \nporting to be \necclesiastical laws laid \ndown by the apostles \nand their immediate \nsuccessors. In reality, \nthe Constitutions were \nwritten by an anony- \nmous Syrian author \ntoward the end of the \n4th century. \n\nSir Thomas Browne \n\n(1605-1682) English \nphysician, author of \nthe famous Religio \nMedici and other \nworks. \n\n\n\nDr. William A. Al- \ncott American \nphysician who un- \ndertook the instruction \nof married couples in \nhis two books, The \nYoung Wife (1837) \nand The Young Hus- \nband (1839). \n\n\n\n913 \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nThomas Branagan \n\nAmerican author of \nThe Excellency of \nFemale Character Vin- \ndicated, 1808. \n\n\n\nbeen brought up, as American women always were in those days, to \nthink that sex was beastly, that all women hated it, and that men\'s \nbrutal lusts were the chief obstacle to happiness in marriage." 36 \n\nA Christian scripture falsely attributed to St. Dionysius, Of the \nNames of God, said the name of Love was not suitable for God, \n"because one could only honor God, not love Him." 37 Love was left to \nthe sinful, bearing out Nietzsche\'s observation that "Christianity gave \nEros poison to drink; he did not die of it but degenerated into a vice." 38 \nOnly recently has it even been suggested that love, or Eros, is \nessential to the moral development of a man, in a sense that was never \nhinted at by the moralists of the west. A man may rise to "a new \nmoral plane" by falling in love, a process that cannot be pursued \nthrough any rationally established program. Western society doesn\'t \nunderstand how to instill a comfortably "instinctive" morality into any \nindividual, even with the opportunity to work on the problem from \nearliest childhood let alone to improve the moral outlook of an adult. \nBut a man\'s emotional commitment to a beloved, if sincere, may \nradically alter and improve his whole view of the world, of himself, of \nright and wrong, and of the individual\'s relations with and responsibil- \nities toward others. 39 \n\nPatriarchal religion was devoted to destruction of the sensual \nfemale nature that elicited and responded to such emotional commit- \nments. Women\'s sexual desire or pleasure was generally considered \ndetrimental to the marital relationship. 40 A standard Christian work \non sex dedicated to Cardinal d\'Este, Sinibaldi\'s 1 7th-century Geneanth- \nropeia, said no woman could conceive if she enjoyed sex. 41 Before \nthe turn of the last century, it was expected that "good" women would \nknow nothing of sexual pleasure. If they showed an inclination to \nlearn, they might be cruelly teased. Thomas Branagan\'s advice to young \nmen was to test the virtue of a fiancee by trying to seduce her, to \nmake sure she would react with "becoming abhorrence." If she seemed \ntoo compliant, she must be jilted. 42 \n\nThe name of John Bowdler became a byword for his pious labors \nin removing all risque words from the Bible, Shakespeare, etc. He \neven objected to any mention of women\'s traditional care of the sick or \nof infants, on moral grounds: "Few women have any idea [Bowdler\'s \nitalics] how much men are disgusted by the slightest approach to these \nin any female. ... By attending the nursery or sick bed, women are \ntoo apt to acquire a habit of conversing on such subjects in language \nwhich men of delicacy are shocked at." 43 Male "delicacy" even \ndictated that the books of male and female authors must be kept on \nseparate bookshelves unless the authors "happen to be married." 44 \n\nThe Victorian authority on sex was Dr. William Acton, who \ncouldn\'t heap too much praise on "all those mysterious sensations \nwhich make up what we call VIRILITY," a quality that "seems \nnecessary to give a man that consciousness of his dignity, or his \ncharacter as head and ruler and of his importance, which is absolutely \n\n\n\n914 \n\n\n\nessential to the well-being of his family, and through it, of society itself. Sex \n\nt is a power, a privilege, of which the man is, and should be, proud." \n\n3ut women were permitted no such pride in their sexual nature. "As a ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\ngeneral rule," said Acton, "a modest woman seldom desires any \n\nexual gratification for herself. She submits to her husband, but only to \n\njlease him; and, but for the desire of maternity, would far rather be \n\nelieved of his attentions." Acton admitted however that there were a \n\njew sad exceptions to his rule, who might be found either in the \n\nlivorce courts or in lunatic asylums, suffering from "the form of insanity \n\nrailed nymphomania." 45 \n\nThose women labeled nymphomaniacs and imprisoned in Victori- \nin asylums were frequently women who had somehow stumbled \nlpon discovery of their own orgasmic capacity and found to their \nlismay that men neither knew nor cared anything about it. Even \n"reud\'s view of female sexuality was all wrong. For over fifty years, \nloctors slavishly followed Freud\'s interpretation and wondered why \nhere were so many "frigid" women, whose sexual readiness was \n:onstantly aroused to no purpose until they rejected sex out of sheer \nrustration. "It is remarkable that only recently has Freud\'s classic theory \n>n the sexuality of women the notion of the double orgasm been \nictually tested and found just plain wrong." 46 \n\nThe 20th century was not much more enlightened than the 19th. \nStall\'s marriage manual, the ultimate authority at the turn of the \nentury, blamed women themselves for the sexual ignorance society \nmposed on them. If a wife failed to understand her husband\'s sexual \nleeds, she was to blame "for her lack of knowledge and consider- \nition." 47 But men\'s lack of knowledge and consideration was part of \nhe culture. \n\nThe oft-heard complaint directed by women at the clumsiness, crassness, \nand incompetence of men in their sexual approaches and in sexual \nintercourse itself, men \'s lack of skill in foreplay and their failure to \nunderstand its meaning, almost certainly substantially reflects the lack \nof tactile experience that many males have suffered in childhood. The \nroughness with which many men will handle women and children \nconstitutes yet another evidence of their having been failed in early tactile \nexperience, for it is difficult to conceive of anyone who had been \ntenderly loved and caressed in infancy not learning to approach a woman \nor a child with especial tenderness. The very word "tenderness" \nimplies softness, delicacy of touch, caring for. The gorilla, that gentle \ncreature, is the most frequently slandered when women wish to \ndescribe the sexual approaches of the average male. Sex seems to be \nregarded as a tension releaser rather than as a profoundly meaningful \nact of communication in a deeply involved human relationship.\' 18 \n\nOne modern woman a rape victim thus expressed her own view \nof sex: \n\nSex, for men, is totally oriented toward the man $ orgasm and isn \'t \nsuccessful unless it involves intercourse and orgasm, which is ridiculous, \n\n\n\n915 \n\n\n\ne~ because sex to me is a much more sensual, much more emotional \n\nexperience. It doesn \'t involve just one particular spot on the body getting \nexcited and aroused, and then it\'s over, and it \'s either a success or \n\n^^^^^^^^^ failure.\'\' 9 \n\nMen culturally trained not to pay attention to women seldom \nunderstood what women meant by "love," even when they tried to \nexplain. The celebrated Kinsey reports on American sexual behavior \ndidn\'t mention "love" in their index. 50 Certainly there was no such idea \nin America as the Tantric karuna, which combined all forms of love \nin communion with the female, though modern women sometimes try \nto grope toward this concept, unaware that it was elucidated long ago: \n\nGestation . . . is a complex inner process in which sexuality is fed by \neverything else a woman has at her disposal, much in the same way that \nshe might feed a fetus. When there is no fetus, an inclusive kind of sexual \nintimacy fills up a comparable inner space. But when sex is separated \nfrom that context, the disparity between a penetration that is no more than \nan "action " and a penetration that reaches into complex inner space \ncan become quite overwhelming. . . . \n\nTo most men the problem . . . does not seem very real. To them the \nclearest aim of sex is orgasm, that moment of intense physical intimacy \nand satisfaction which so often serves as a substitute for other kinds of \nintimacy. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why men seem to be so \nconcerned with satisfying women sexually and interpret that satisfaction in \nterms of what they think would satisfy them if they were women. It \nmay also be one of the reasons why men seem to think that many women \ncan never be completely satisfied sexually. The terrain where a woman \nremains forever unsatisfied or even, as they say, "insatiable, " is probably \nthe area where her sexuality borders most closely on that more complex \npsycho-sexual area of her being. 5I \n\nIn Oriental countries where an image of the Goddess was \nretained, broader ideas of sexuality were retained also: \n\nWestern attitudes . . . look on sexual intercourse as a matter of tension, \nappetite and relief. . . according to the simplistic biological conception \nwhich is still current. . . . It is well known that the man who, in the Kinsey \nReport on the Human Male, recorded a frequency above thirty times a \nday for many years became a kind of folk-hero in America. Sexual love, in \nsuch a context, becomes at best a matter of frequently happily shared \norgasms. \n\nTo the traditional Indian mind this attitude is grotesque and pathet- \nic. Even the ordinary man recognized that such banality was absurd. ... \nEighteenth-century Indian harlots mocked European men for their \nmiserable sexual performance, calling them "dunghill cocks" for whom \nthe act was over in a few seconds. Despite recent advances in sexological \nknowledge, the West\'s chosen external explanations of sex, attached as \nthey are to a provisional and impoverished rationalization of the infinite \ncomplex of human experience, still tend to regard sex as the pursuit of \norgasm Traditional India did not." \n\nA mystical or poetic view of sex, like the Indian one, seemed to \n\n\n\n916 \n\n\n\njar the puritan consciousness even more than a "dirty" or degraded Sex \n\nview. Dr. Marie Stopes\'s Married Love was imported from England \n\nin 1918 but banned for obscenity in the U.S., chiefly on account of ^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nsuch delirious passages as the following: \n\nThe half-swooning sense of flux which overtakes the spirit in their eternal \nmoment at the apex of rapture sweeps into its flaming tides the whole \nessence of the man and woman, and as it were, the heat of the contact \nvaporizes their consciousness so that it Alls the whole of cosmic space. \nFor the moment they are identified with the divine thoughts, the waves of \neternal force, which to the Mystic often appear in terms of golden \nlight." \n\nSome progress has been made since the sexual obtuseness of \nwestern men made them a laughingstock in India. But recent investiga- \ntors found "a view of sex that is as distorted as the Victorian, for it is \nstill shrouded with the unrealistic expectations and outmoded standards \nof gender behavior of the past. Fantasy rather than reality is its \nkeynote; hostility, anxiety, and guilt are aggravated rather than alleviat- \ned." 54 Significantly, a male author characterizes male sexuality as \nloveless and death-centered, capable of destroying the foundations of \nsociety: \n\nContemporary eroticism attempts to free woman sexually but according to \na masculine conception of sexuality. . . . The present rehabilitation of \nthe erotic in its purely sexual, loveless aspect is completely at variance with \nthe truly feminine conception . . . an ultimate striving toward disloca- \ntion, destruction, and death Thanatos as against Eros, the love-filled \nerotic, unifying and conservationist. . . . Ultimately, this overemphasis \nof the masculine component in Western society threatens to destroy its \nfoundations. fs \n\nTo counterbalance the destructiveness of male-dominated soci- \nety, nothing could be effective except recognition of the feminine \nprinciple, according to George Sand: "It will be in the female heart \npar excellence, as it always has been, that love and devotion, patience \nand pity, will find their true home. On woman falls the duty, in a \nworld of brute passions, of preserving the virtue of charity. . . . When \nwoman ceases to play that role, life will be the loser." 56 Modern \nthinkers also regret the loss of cultural emphasis on the feminine \nmorality that can integrate sex with affection, tenderness, and sensi- \ntivity toward others\' emotional needs. It has been often said that \nmale-dominated societies tend to burden the sexual impulses of both \nwomen and men with basically unrelated guilts, fears, angers, and their \nresulting aggressions. Some forms of "entertainment" for example \ntake advantage of the new frankness to introduce disturbingly sadistic \nelements into mass socialization for sexual adulthood. "Rather than \nlament the fact that sexual appetite is now being encouraged, we might \nmore profitably spend our time trying to ensure that the emotions \nthat are integrated with it are the ones we approve of." 57 \n\n\n\n917 \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nAs recently as 1966, an anthropological study of the Irish \nislanders of Inis Beag revealed a mini-culture of 19th-century Christian- \npatriarchal patterns in sexual life. Female orgasm was unknown. \nWomen were trained to endure rather than enjoy sex. Men habitually \nejaculated within seconds. Modesty was the overwhelming preoccu- \npation of both sexes; husbands and wives didn\'t see each other naked. \nSexual foreplay consisted of rough fondling outside the sleeping \ngarments. No coital position other than Venus observa was used. \n\nPremarital sex was virtually unknown, since young couples were \nnever alone together. Not even "walking out," the old-fashioned \nversion of dating, was allowed. Young people received no instruction in \nsexual matters. The islanders said after marriage "nature would take \nits course" without the embarrassment of discussion. \n\nThough the men were often at sea in small boats, they never \nlearned to swim, being unwilling to undress in public for this purpose. \n"Bathing" in the sea meant wading, fully clothed. The sexes were \nrigidly separated for this activity. Men were known to die of disease or \ninjury rather than to go to a hospital on the mainland, where they \nthought their bodies would be bared to the eyes of female nurses. \n\nEven the dogs of Inis Beag were whipped for licking their genitals \nor other "obscene" behavior. Imported copies of American maga- \nzines such as Life or Time were denounced from the pulpit as \npornography. Fear of female "mysteries" was overt: women were not \napproached sexually for many months after childbirth, or during men- \nstruation, when men thought them especially dangerous. Predictably, \nsevere repression exacted a severe toll in quarrelsomeness, alcoholism, \nviolence, and frequent mental disturbances. 58 \n\nParadoxically, the more sexuality is banned and ignored, the more \nfear it seems to engender in men. A patriarchal-ascetic ethic seems to \narrange sexual attitudes according to the way men would like them \narranged, but it doesn\'t work well even for men. A psychiatrist says, \n"In the privacy of our consulting room we do from time to time see \nstrong men fret, and hear them talk of women with dread and horror \nand awe, as if women, far from being timid creatures to be patronized, \nwere as powerful as the sea and inescapable as fate. . . . Man, con- \nfronted by woman, does seem to feel, variously, frightened, revolted, \ndominated, bewildered, and even, at times, superfluous." 59 One male \nauthor in a revealing passage on men\'s sexual feelings refers to a woman \nas "it," but also admits "general helplessness in the face of her," and a \nsense of her "awesomeness and power" seemingly overblown terms \nfor an ordinary human female: \n\nWe cannot relate to the total object as it [sic] is, and thus we need \nstandardized definitions of sexual attractiveness. These we get in the \nform of "cues" that serve to cut the object down to manageable size: we \nlook at the breast or the black underwear, which allow us not really to \nhave to take account of the total person we are relating to. . . . [W]e strip \n\n\n\n918 \n\n\n\nthe partner of awesomeness and power and so overcome our general Sex \n\nhelplessness in the face of her. 60 \n\nThe symbols of "sexiness" are created and instilled by the HmHi^Hi \n\nsociety, however odd it may seem to realize that human physiological \nresponses can actually be keyed to abstract images. "It is now quite \nclear that how a person behaves sexually is largely determined not by \ninborn factors but by learning." 61 The prevailing conventional wis- \ndom and its influence on the growing child determine whether most \npeople will enjoy sex or hate it, perceiving their own bodies as heaven \nor hell. Western anti-sexuality has created many individuals tending \ntoward the "hate" or "hell" end of the spectrum, epitomized by a \npsychiatric patient who said, "Somehow I always think that sexual \ni intercourse is a great disgrace for humans." A female patient called \nher body an "abhorrent envelope," and said, "I wish I could tear this \nskin off. If I didn\'t have this stupid body, I would be as pure outside as \nI feel inside." 62 \n\nWomen have an especially difficult time with the body-image in a \nsociety that attaches little value to their complex body-oriented roles \nof wife, mother, nurturer, or comforter; and may even cease to play \nthese roles when they have fully accepted the value system of the \ndominant sex. Women don\'t reject traditional "feminine" roles out of \nperversity, nor because of that Freudian absurdity, penis envy. Like \nmen, most women prefer to do what their society values and rewards. If \nthe wife-and-mother role is undervalued or even deprecated, as it \nhas been throughout the past two millenia in the western world \nwomen can hardly be blamed for seeking valid achievement in other \nfields. 63 In our society the universal standard of valuation is money, and \nthe so-called "career" of wife-and-mother earns none at all. \n\nUnderevaluation of the mother affects sons as well as daughters, \nsince the mother\'s reaction to social expectations of her inevitably \ncreates a deep impression on her children. "Psychiatric observation \nsuggests that human sexual behavior is subtly shaped by the nature of \nthe social attachments formed during a person\'s development"; and the \nmother is the primary social attachment. 64 Chodorow says the mod- \nern civilized male "is in the unhappy position of being able to attain \nmasculine identity almost solely through efforts to distinguish himself \nfrom the person closest to him [the mother], with whom he might most \nnaturally identify. His efforts commonly take the form of a rather \nprimitive rejection of all that is \'feminine\' in women and in himself." 65 \n\nSexual development is further hampered by conventional religions \nwhich still attach fear and guilt to almost every stage of the process. \nIgnoring recent proofs that masturbation is necessary for development \nof normal orgasmic capacity in both sexes, Pope Paul VI\'s 1976 \ndeclaration on sexual ethics pronounced masturbation "a grave moral \ndisorder." Moreover, within the framework of marriage, only the \n"finality" of procreation could "ensure the moral goodness" of sex in \n\n\n\n919 \n\n\n\nSex \n\n\n\nother words, sex must make babies, not pleasure. 66 As for premarital \nsex, Norman Vincent Peale declared it a dreadful sin even for persons \ndeeply in love; they cannot be forgiven without prolonged spiritual \n"treatment." 67 \n\nIt is now said that sexual appetites have "little or no relation to \n\nbiological or physiological needs [Ejrotic urges stem more from \n\nsocio-cultural factors than from those of the strictly physiological na- \nture." 68 Therefore the broad extent of ugly or cruel sexual behavior \npatterns in modern society should stimulate serious thought about what \nthe society is teaching. In 1972, the Chief of the Sex Section of the \nWashington D.C. Police Department reported: "The newspapers print \nonly what they want to. I tell them about little girls of seven or eight \nwho come up with venereal diseases inflicted on them by male mem- \nbers of their own families. An appalling number of 1 1- and \n12-year-olds are giving birth after being raped by their own fathers. But \nthey won\'t print things like this. They\'re only heart-breaking and \nhorrible not sensational." 69 \n\nA report of the Commission on Obscenity and Pornography \nconcluded: "Failure to talk openly and directly about sex . . . overem- \nphasizes sex, gives it a magical nonnatural quality Such failure \n\nmakes teaching children and adolescents to become fully and ade- \nquately functioning sexual adults a more difficult task The very \n\nfoundation of our society rests upon healthy sexual attitudes grounded \nin appropriate and accurate sexual information." 70 In other words, the \nfoundations of society rest on dissemination of precisely the kind of \ninformation that Christian morality insisted on withholding from one \nand all men, women, and children. \n\nChurches today have largely renounced all their responsibility to \nestablish guidelines for sexual development or sexual behavior, leaving \ntheir congregations in an area of confusion. Theologians stress "the \npersonal responsibility of the Christian to find God\'s will for himself." 71 \nIn which case, he hardly needs a church. \n\nI. S. Harris, 255. 2. R.E.L. Masters, xxvi. 3.

St. John Chry- \nsostom said men suffer "a thousand evils" from having to look at \nwomen; "the beauty of women is the greatest snare." St. Odo of Cluny \nrefused to be ensnared; he said, "How should we desire to embrace \nwhat is no more than a sack of dung!" According to Walter Map, \n"Even the very good woman, who is rarer than the phoenix, cannot \nbe loved without the loathesome bitterness of fear and worry and \nconstant unhappiness." A 19th-century Anglican churchman said \nwomen are "intrinsically inferior in excellence, imbecile by sex and \nnature, weak in body, inconstant in mind, and imperfect and infirm \nin character." 5 In the 1890s, the president of a leading theological \nseminary declared, "My Bible commands the subjection of women \nforever." 6 \n\nSo it did. Through the centuries, the Bible supported sexist \nsentiments which were echoed by all churchmen. St. Paul said: "The \nhead of every man is Christ; and the head of every woman is the man" \n(1 Corinthians 1 1:3). St. Peter said in the Gospel of Thomas: \n"Women are not worthy of life." 7 Clement of Alexandria quoted the \nwords of Christ from the Gospel According to the Egyptians: "I have \ncome to destroy the works of the female." 8 He added: "Every woman \nought to be filled with shame at the thought that she is a woman." 9 \n\nUp to the modern era, clergymen continued to appeal to biblical \nauthority to maintain the political subjection of women. "The clergy \nwere often in the forefront of the fight against suffrage, dredging up \nquotations from the Bible to prove that the natural order of things was \nfemale obedience to man." Simone de Beauvoir says: "For the Jews, \nMohammedans and Christians among others, man is master by divine \nright, the fear of God will therefore repress any impulse towards \nrevolt in the downtrodden female." As late as 1971 an Episcopalian \nbishop confirmed these views: "The sexuality of Christ is no accident \nnor is his masculinity incidental. This is the divine choice." Feminists \nbelieve that even if the churches should destroy themselves in the \neffort, they will cling to their notion of male supremacy to the very end, \nfor this was their primary foundation in the beginning. 10 Theology\'s \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nSt. John Chrysostom, \n\n"Golden-mouthed \nJohn," 4th-century \nChristian orator who \nserved as Patriarch of \nConstantinople until he \nincurred the wrath of \nthe empress Eudoxia, \nwho arranged to \nhave him deposed and \nexiled. \n\nWalter Map Canon \nof St. Paul\'s, Lincoln, \nand Hereford; arch- \ndeacon of Oxford; \necclesiastical justice \nattached to the court of \nHenry II in the late \n1 2th century. Map was \n(probably falsely) \ncredited with authorship \nof some of the older \nArthurian legends. \n\n\n\n921 \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nentire conceptual system was invented by men to serve the interests of \nmen and, not incidentally, to restrict and suppress the interests of \nwomen." \n\nChurch fathers long ago laid down the principle of woman\'s guilt \nfor the existence of death and sin. Augustine blamed the perpetuation \nof original sin on the "concupiscence" that united male bodies with \nfemale ones under any circumstances, including marriage. 12 Chris- \ntianity was the first religion to announce that it was sinful just to be alive, \non account of having been sexually conceived and born of a wom- \nan. 13 St. John Chrysostom commanded every Christian father to instill \n\ninto his son "a resolute spirit against womankind Let him have \n\nno converse with any woman save only his mother. Let him see no \nwoman." 14 \n\nSometimes the writings of Christian men revealed an almost \nhysterical fear of woman. Her very glance could "infect, entice, \nbewitch." Her eyes "poison and intoxicate the mind: yea, her company \ninduceth impudency, corrupteth virginity, confoundeth and consu- \nmeth the bodies, the goods, and the very souls of men. And finally her \nbody destroyeth and rotteth the very flesh and bones of man\'s body." \nVairus said women become witches because "they have such an \nunbridled force of fury and concupiscence naturally. . . . And they \nare so troubled with evil humors, that out go their venomous exhala- \ntions, engendered through their illfavored diet, and increased by \nmeans of their pernicious excrements, which they expel." 15 \n\nJohn Aylmer labeled all women "tale-bearers, eavesdroppers, ru- \nmor raisers, evil tongued, worse minded, and in every wise doltified \nwith the dregs of the Devil\'s dung hill." 16 Similar opinions have been \noffered by modern woman-abusers, such as the rapist: "I thought . . . \nwomen were trashy, low-down and scummy because that\'s what I had \nbeen taught." 17 \n\nAndrew the Chaplain said woman is "by nature a miser, envious, a \nslanderer . . . greedy, a slave to her belly, inconstant, fickle . . . disobe- \ndient and impatient of restraint, spotted with the sin of pride and \ndesirous of vainglory, a liar, a drunkard, a babbler, no keeper of \nsecrets, too much given to wantonness, prone to every evil, and never \nloving any man in her heart." 18 \n\nJohn Scotus Erigena taught that human beings were once without \nsin and without sexuality; but after they disobeyed God, they were \ndivided into two sexes. The sinless part was embodied in man, the sinful \npart in woman. 19 Other theologians said woman was "the confusion \nof man, an insatiable beast, a continuous anxiety, an incessant warfare, a \ndaily ruin." The church ostensibly made war on the devil, but in \nactual practice made war on women. "Woman was the Church\'s rival, \nthe temptress, the distraction, the obstacle to holiness, the Devil\'s \ndecoy." 20 Official church literature said: \n\nAll wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman [T]he \n\nnatural reason is that she is more carnal than a man, as is clear from her \n\n\n\n922 \n\n\n\nmany carnal abominations. And it should be noted that there was a defect \nin the formation of the first woman, since she was formed from a bent \nrib, that is, a rib of the breast, which is bent as it were in a contrary \ndirection to a man. And since through this defect she is an imperfect \nanimal, she always deceives. 2 \' \n\nCuriously enough, modern genetic research indicates that the \ntruth may be something like the reverse of this view. The XY chromo- \nsome that produces a male is physiologically an "incomplete" female \nchromosome. Some individuals are born with an XYY chromosome \nabnormality, making them genetic super-males. They are said to be \ntall, below average in intelligence, and strongly disposed to criminal \nbehavior. 22 \n\nThis would have surprised men like Orestes Brownson, who \ninsisted that woman\'s "ambition and natural love of power" must be \nsubject to masculine control, otherwise "she is out of her element, and a \nsocial anomaly, sometimes a hideous monster, which men seldom \nare, excepting through a woman\'s influence." 23 Such men never \nbothered to notice that their denunciations of women were self- \ncontradictory; as in this case, for instance, if woman\'s love of power was \n"natural," then in exercising it she would be in her element, not out \nof it. \n\nMartin Luther claimed the physical differences between men and \nwomen demonstrated God\'s plan for sexism. "Men have broad and \nlarge chests and small and narrow hips and more understanding than \nwomen who have but small and narrow chests and broad hips, to the \nend that they should remain at home, sit still, keep house and bear and \nbring up children." 24 But if their bearing and bringing up children \nwore them out, it was no matter, Luther said: "If women get tired and \ndie of bearing, there is no harm in that; let them die as long as they \nbear; they were made for that." 25 \n\nSchopenhauer, who detested women, found nothing likeable \nabout their physical appearance: "It is only the man whose intellect is \nclouded by his sexual impulses that could give the name of the fair sex \nto that undersized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short- \nlegged race. . . . [T]he sympathies that exist between them and men are \nskin-deep only, and do not touch the mind or the feelings or the \ncharacter." 26 Hartley tends to agree that thanks to Christian tradition, \n"An extreme outward sex-attraction has come to veil but thinly a \ndeep inward sex-antipathy, until it seems almost impossible that women \nand men can ever really understand one another." 27 \n\nThose few Renaissance men who would speak on behalf of \n( women were outside the church, and usually suspected of heresy, like \nAgrippa von Nettesheim, who wrote that women "are treated by the \nmen as conquered by the conquerors, not by any divine necessity, for \nany reason, but according to custom, education, fortune, and the \ntyrant\'s opportunity." \n\nThe tyranny of men prevailing over divine right and the laws of nature, \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nOrestes Augustus \nBrownson (1803-1876) \nU. S. arbiter of opin- \nion, writer on \nspiritualism, religion, \nsocial reform, states\' \nrights, etc.; publisher \nof Brownson \'s Quarter- \nly, 1844-75. \n\n\n\n923 \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nJosephine Henry \n\n19th-century Kentucky \nsuffragist and \npamphleteer, active in \nthe women\'s rights \nmovement. \n\n\n\nslays by law the liberty of woman, abolishes it by use and custom, and \nextinguishes it by education. For the woman, as soon as she is born, is \nfrom her earliest years detained at home in idleness, and as if destitute \nof capacity for higher occupations, is permitted to conceive of nothing \nbeyond needle and thread. Then when she has attained years of \npuberty she is delivered over to the jealous empire of a man, or shut up \nforever in a shop of vestals. The law also forbids her to fill public \noffices. No prudence entitles her to plead in open court. 28 \n\nThere was sex discrimination even in the penalties imposed for \nwitchcraft. Female witches were more severely punished than male \nwitches. A law of 1683 said that for the crime of causing death by \nwitchcraft, a man may be hanged, but a woman must be burned at the \nstake. Men could with impunity kill their wives (e.g., by beating) in \nthe 1650s, but women were burned for killing their husbands, a crime \ndefined as "petty treason." 29 \n\nA self-perpetuating belief in woman\'s inferior intellect was fostered \nby the almost universal custom of keeping women out of schools, all \nbut a few aristocratic ladies who could receive an expensive private \neducation. Queen Elizabeth I of England was unsexed by several \nhistorians who thought she was too clever to be female. They claimed \nshe died in infancy, and a boy was secretly raised in her place. The \nsmall minority of educated women were seldom accepted as such. On \none occasion a learned lady was presented as a curiosity to King \nJames I, and he was told she was fluent in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. \nHe only inquired, "But can she spin?" 30 \n\nThe church controlled most schools, and the church would have \nno truck with women unless it was unavoidable. St. Columkille made \na rule that no woman could even be buried in the vicinity of a Christian \nchurch, alleging that this was the custom from Christianity\'s begin- \nnings. County Tyrone in Ireland still has a Reh\'g-na-man, "cemetery of \nwomen," located a half-mile from the church where only men were \nburied in the churchyard. 31 Some churchmen opined that women \ndidn\'t even have any souls to save. Ockham claimed women did have \nsouls, and on that account should be allowed to vote in church councils. \nThe pope instantly condemned this as heresy. 32 \n\nJosephine K. Henry castigated the churches for their consistently \nantifemale attitudes over the centuries: \n\nHas the Church ever issued an edict that women must be equal with man \nbefore the canon or the civil law, that her thoughts should be incorpo- \nrated in creed or code, that she should own her own body and property in \nmarriage, or have a legal claim to her children born in wedlock, which \nChristianity claims is a "sacrament" and one of the "holy mysteries"!\' . . . \nNo institution in modern civilization is so tyrannical and so unjust to \nwoman as is the Christian Church. It demands everything from her and \ngives her nothing in return. The history of the Church does not \n\ncontain a single suggestion for the equality of woman Through \n\ntyranny and falsehood alone is Christianity able to hold woman in \nsubjection. n \n\n\n\n924 \n\n\n\nIndeed, women were better served by pre-Christian laws nearly Sexism \n\neverywhere. Under the ancient Byzantine code, inheritance laws made \n\nno distinction between heirs on the basis of their sex; and although ^^^^^^^^^i \n\nadulterous men were executed, adulterous women were not. 54 After \ncenturies of Christian revision, the laws freely allowed men to \ncommit adultery, though their wives could be imprisoned or beaten to \ndeath for it. Until 1857, no English woman could obtain a divorce on \nany grounds without a special Act of Parliament, which meant only \nupper-class women with plenty of political leverage could even hope \nfor a divorce. 35 \n\nIn 1835, a Mrs. Caroline Norton left her husband after he \nrepeatedly subjected her to beatings, mental abuse, and infidelity. He \nkept his mistress in the same house with her. A court ruled that the wife \nneed not return to the house, but the husband was given their three \nchildren because the wife had "condoned his actions" by staying with \nhim through all his cruelties. In 1839, the Infants\' Custody Act \nintroduced a slight modification. At his own discretion, a judge in equity \ncould allow separated mothers to keep children under seven years of \nage, or to have visiting rights to older children, provided the mother was \nnot guilty of adultery. 36 Fathers suffered no such restriction, of \ncourse. \n\nWomen who refused to submit to the "discipline" of marriage, but \ninstead played the dangerous game of promising without delivering, \nwere known as jilts. Such women aroused the most violent outbursts of \nsexist sentiment, according to an old pamphlet: \n\nTheir tricks and devices are numberless, and not to be paralleled by any \nthing but their Ingratitude and Inhumanity; there indeed they exceed \nthemselves; nothing in Nature being so perfectly brutish and cruel as one \nof these kind [sic] of Creatures ... a Vermin so ravenous and mali- \ncious, and withal so subtle and designing, so formally chaste and \nhypocritically virtuous, and yet so scandalously common and impu- \ndently lewd, so proud, and yet so mercenary, and above all, so insolently ill \nnatured, that in the short character of a Jilt, are comprehended all the \nVices, Follies and Impertinences of the whole Sex. . . . In short, I cannot \nbut fancy them a Colony of Hell-Cats, planted here by the Devil, as a \nmischief to Mankind. 37 \n\nNoting that women often refused to play fair in the game for \nwhich men made all the rules, even Freud failed to transcend the sexist \nattitudes of his time. He wrote: "One cannot resist the thought that \nthe level of normal morality is different for women. Their superego \nnever becomes so unshakeable, so impersonal, so independent of its \naffective origins, as we demand it of a man. Critics since time immemo- \nrial have reproached women of certain character traits: that they \nexhibit less of a sense of justice than men do; that they are less prepared \nto submit to the great necessities of life." Since Freud regarded male \ndomination as one of the great necessities of life, he should hardly have \nbeen surprised to find women resisting it. Simone de Beauvoir said \n\n\n\n925 \n\n\n\nSexism \n\n\n\nChristine Pierce \n\nContemporary Ameri- \ncan feminist, \nprofessor of law and \nphilosophy at Har- \nvard and New York \nState University. \n\n\n\nevery woman knows that "masculine morality, as it concerns her, is a \nvast hoax. Man pompously thunders forth his code of virtue and \nhonor; but in secret he invites her to disobey it, and he even counts on \nher disobedience; without it, all that splendid facade behind which he \ntakes cover would collapse." 38 \n\nSince women weren\'t told the rules of the game, many of them \nbecame losers while they were still too young to figure it out for \nthemselves. Commenting on Oscar Wilde\'s homosexuality trial, W.T. \nStead remarked, "If Oscar Wilde, instead of indulging in dirty tricks \nof indecent familiarity with boys and men, had ruined the lives of half a \ndozen innocent simpletons of girls, or had broken up the home of his \nfriend by corrupting his friend\'s wife, no one could have laid a finger on \nhim. The male is sacrosanct: the female is fair game." 59 \n\nThough women were scorned for being "simpletons," they were \neven more violently scorned when they tried to develop their minds. \nFlorence Nightingale\'s popularity inspired many women to seek educa- \ntions in medicine, but male students ganged up on them. In 1870 a \ngroup of student doctors formed lines to prevent five women from \nentering classes in Surgeons\' Hall in London. Medical examiners \ntried to embarrass female students with indecent questions. When \nwomen received high marks in examinations, they were passed over, \nand scholarships were awarded to the men immediately below their \nlevel. \n\nIt was the same in other professions. In 1879, Birmingham \nschoolmasters barred women from employment as teachers of small \nboys, on the ground that it would encourage "immorality." Lawyers \ndenied women admission to the Inns of Court. Determined feminist \nefforts brought about admission of some women to classes at Queen\'s \nCollege in 1 848; but the Bishop of London excluded women from \nWheatstone\'s classes on electricity, because they had "congregated too \nabundantly" in Sir Charles Lyell\'s geology classes, keeping more \ndeserving students (i.e., men) from finding places in the classroom. In \nthe field of religion, the Church of England found it "unthinkable" \nthat women should ever be admitted to the ministry. 40 \n\nThe basic fallacy of sexism in employment or education was \npointed out by Christine Pierce: "We need not fear that women will \ndo what they cannot do." 41 If women were really unable to learn \nmedicine, law, theology, science, or any other field of endeavor, it \nwould hardly have been necessary for men to exert such efforts to keep \nthem from learning. The theory of feminine intellectual inferiority \nbegan to recede from view when women managed to receive education. \nBut many men still clung to the belief that women must be less able \nto think than men. \n\nIn 1913 T.E. Reed wrote a book called Sex, Its Origin and \nDetermination, to prove "scientifically" that women were biological- \nly inferior to men. The author said coitus during an incoming tide \nalways conceived boys, while coitus during an outgoing tide con- \n\n\n\n926 \n\n\n\nceived girls proving that the female was weaker, born of "waning" \nenergy. Despite the fact that incoming and outgoing tides differed on \nevery one of the world\'s coastlines, and infants conceived inland \ncouldn\'t be identified with any tide, the theory proved popular. 42 \n\nIn many ways, sexist thinkers have tried to pretend male domi- \nnance is "natural" or is a divinely ordained biological mandate. Yet as \nother mammalian species demonstrate, such an arrangement could \nserve no biological purpose. \n\nAny animal species in which males were biologically programmed \nto attack and injure the females would be at a disadvantage in terms \nof species survival, since mammalian young can\'t grow to maturity \nwithout healthy, competent mothers. 43 Thus it is found that, in most \nspecies, males are biologically inhibited from attacking females, even \nunder strong provocation. And the one virtually unbreakable male \nanimal taboo is any kind of interference between a female and the \nyoung she protects. \n\nKaren Homey suggested that men\'s antagonism may have devel- \noped as a result of sexual envy: "The male is sexually dependent on \nthe female to a higher degree than the woman is on him, because in \nwomen part of the sexual energy is linked to generative processes. \nCould it be that men, therefore, have a vital interest in keeping women \ndependent on them? M44 Judith Antonelli says, "Patriarchy is based \non the \'phallacy\' that the male is creator. Man\'s original awe and envy \nof woman becomes, under patriarchy, resentment and hostility. The \nonly way man can possess female power is through woman, and so he \ncolonizes her, suppressing her sexuality so that it serves him rather \nthan being the source of her power. . . . Patriarchy is indeed a male \n\n\n\nShadow \n\n\n\nneurosis. \n\n\n\n1. Evans, N.H.N., 180. 2. de Riencourt, 227. 3.Rees,227. 4. Shumaker,95. \n\n5.Bullough,98, 187,203. 6. Stanton, 194. 7.

Pagan Europe generally described the ghosts of ancestors as \nblack, like shadows, and desirous of blood, the elixir of rebirth. \n\nThe shadow was a vulnerable soul because it was external and had \nto be carefully preserved from accident. Many superstitious people \n\n\n\nKaren Horney, nee \n\nDanielsen (1885-1952) \nU.S. psychoanalyst \nand teacher, Freudian- \ntrained but breaking \naway from Freudian \nthought in many re- \nspects; author of The \nNeurotic Personality \nof Our Time (1937), \nOur Inner Conflicts \n(1945), Neurosis and \nHuman Growth \n(1950), etc. \n\n\n\n927 \n\n\n\nShaharit \n\n\n\nPausanias Creek \ntraveler and geographer \nof the 2nd century \na.d. Living in a time of \ndeclining culture, he \nwas inspired by a desire \nto describe the an- \ncient sacred sites for \nposterity. \n\n\n\neven today think it dangerous to let their shadows fall across an open \ngrave, rocky cleft, or swift stream. 1 \n\nThe Bible shows Joshua and Caleb placing a death-curse on their \nenemies by saying "Their shadow is departed from them" (Numbers \n14:9). This was a typical "doom-saying," supposedly a prophecy to be \nfulfilled by its very utterance. \n\nOne could also give one\'s soul to a god by dedicating one\'s shadow \nto him. Pausanias said human bodies lost their shadows in the sanc- \ntuary of Zeus Lycaeus (Wolfish Zeus). 2 From such beliefs descended \nthe shadowless "werewolf" or vampire of medieval superstition. \nSoullessness was indicated by lack of a shadow or a reflection, both of \nwhich were anciently identified with souls. \n\nLike those who pretended to give their shadows to the ancient \ngods, those who gave their souls to the devil could be distinguished by \nlack of a shadow, according to medieval superstition. The most famous \nshadowless man in Jewish folklore was Peter Schlemihl, whose name \nbecame a byword for a fool because the devil tricked him into parting \nwith his shadow. 3 He was apparently based on the biblical patriarch \nShelumiel, whose name meant "friend of God," possibly because he \ngave God his shadow-soul. In Bohemia, Peter Schlemihl was known \nas Prschemischl, a hero mated to the legendary Queen Libussa. This \nmay have been a garbled recollection of the sacred marriage of Pater \nLiber and the Goddess Libera. 4 \n\nAnother version of Pater-Peter and his shadow-soul appeared in \nActs 5:15-16. People troubled by sickness or demonic possession \nwere brought into a street where the shadow of St. Peter passing by \n"might overshadow some of them"; and with this kind of soul-contact \n"they were healed every one." \n\nIn the pagan context, a shadowless man was not a demon, a \nwerewolf, or a "Schlemihl" but one whose soul had gone into eternal \nbliss. Plutarch said at the end of the world, the blessed ones would be \nhappy forever "in a state neither needing food nor casting a \nshadow." 5 \n\nOn earth, however, a shadowless state was to be feared. Jews lived \nin terror of the "noonday devil" (Keteb), a stealer of shadows. It \nmade the shadow-soul small and weak at noonday, leaving the owner \nvulnerable to demons of disease. 6 This shadow-stealing devil also \nentered into Christian superstition as the demonium meridianum \n(noonday devil). \n\nl.Frazer,G.B.,575. 2. d\'Alvidla, 64. 3.

See Lucifer. \n\n\n\n928 \n\n\n\nShakta Shakta \n\nA male worshipper of the Tantric image of the Great Goddess, \n\nShakti; a man versed in the techniques of Tantric yoga and identified ^i \n\nwith the Goddess herself through sexual union with her earthly \n\nrepresentative. A shakta was also known as a sadhaka or sadhu, possible \n\norigin of the "Sadducees" mentioned in the Bible. See Tantrism. \n\n\n\nShakti \n\nTantric title of the Great Goddess ( Kali Ma), realized both as a \nsexual partner and as the innermost, animating soul of man or god, like \nthe Greek Psyche, Roman Anima, Gnostic Sophia, Cabalistic She- \nkina, all based on the Shakti. Jung said she was the figure known as My \nLady Soul: "Every mother and every beloved is forced to become the \ncarrier and embodiment of this omnipresent and ageless image, which \ncorresponds to the deepest reality in a man." \' \n\nShakti is translated "Cosmic Energy." She implies "power, ability, \ncapacity, faculty, strength, prowess; regal power; the power of com- \nposition, poetic power, genius; the power or signification of a word or \nterm; the power inherent in cause to produce its necessary effect. . . . \n[S]hakti\'\\s the female organ; shakti is the active power of a deity and is \nregarded, mythologically, as his goddess-consort and queen." 2 Every \ngod needed his Shakti, or he was helpless to act. The Tantras say "the \nfemale principle antedates and includes the male principle, and . . . \nthis female principle is the supreme Divinity." ? \n\nTantric doctrine said mortal women are "life itself," and Goddess- \nlike, because they embody the principle of Shakti. The sages "hold \nwomen in great esteem and call them Shaktis and to ill-treat a Shakti, \nthat is, a woman, is a crime." A Tantric synonym for "woman" was \nShaktiman, "Mind of Shakti" or "Possessor of Shakti." 4 \n\nA Shakti was also a spirit-wife, or female guardian angel, who \ncould be incarnate in the earthly wife or mistress, or a wholly \nsupernatural figure. "An important division of the \'mythology of wom- \nan\' is devoted to showing that it is always a feminine being who helps \nthe hero to conquer immortality or to emerge victorious from his \ninitiatory ordeals. . . . Every Teleut shaman has a celestial wife who \nlives in the seventh heaven, where he meets her and makes love to her \nduring his ecstatic journeys." 5 \n\nFinal union with the Shakti occurred at the moment of death, \naccording to Tantric mystics. She was both the individual and the \ncosmic Goddess, absorbing the soul and body of the dying sage into \nherself, an experience of unsurpassable bliss on his part. "The \npossession of her, the cosmic Shakti, the living embodiment of the \nprinciple of beauty and youth eternal, is the ultimate quest, the very \nhighest prize." 6 \n\nThe Kulacudamani Nigama said not even God could become the \n\n\n\n929 \n\n\n\nShalirrur \nShamrock \n\n\n\nLalita Sahasrana- \n\nmamOneof the \nTantric texts in \npraise of the Goddess \nKali-Shakti. \n\n\n\nAvesta Early scrip- \ntures of Zoroastrianism, \nwritten in Avestan, \nan ancient Iranian lan- \nguage; still used by \nthe Parsees as a Bible \nand prayer book. \n\n\n\nsupreme Lord unless Shakti entered into him. All things arose from \ntheir union, but she said, "There is none but Myself Who is the Mother \nto create." The Lalita Sahasranamam said "The series of universes \nappear and disappear with the opening and shutting of Her eyes." As \nthe god required her power before he could do anything at all, so her \nworshipper on earth required the power of his own Istadevata, Shakti or \nlady-love. 7 \n\nThe same system was followed by Middle-Eastern mystics like the \nSufis, who deemed the mystic lady-love or fravashi essential to any \nman\'s enlightenment. Early Christian Gnostics also worshipped Shakti \nunder such names as Sophia, Pneuma, Eide, or Anima. Gnostic \nwritings show that post-mortem union with one\'s own soul was per- \nceived in sexual symbolism, as in the Mandaean Liturgies for the \nDead: the soul or "image" (Eide) embraces and caresses the dead man \nlike a beloved woman. This Tantric idea came into the west by way \nof the Avesta doctrine that, after the death of a believer, his own \nconscience would welcome him "in the form of a fair maiden." 8 \n\n1.

The garden was both her body and the after-world, \nlike the Tibetan Shal-Mari, a "land of souls." The same mystic \ngarden probably was the body of the Middle-Eastern Great Goddess, \nSheol-Mari; for "Sheol" which later became a synonym for \n"hell" was originally a magic garden within the belly of Mother Ear \nAs the Enclosed Garden (hortus conclusus) it represented the God- \ndess Mari as a Virgin. As the pardes (paradise) she was the Virgin Brie \nof Hebrew god-kings. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShamrock \n\nThe Celtic trefoil, which originated in the east. Pre-Islamic Arabs \ncalled the trefoil shamrakh, the three-lobed lily or lotus flower of the \nMoon-goddess\'s trinity: a design of "three yonis" which appeared on \nartifacts of the ancient Indus Valley civilization, as well as on stone, \npottery, and woodwork in Mesopotamia, Crete, and Egypt between \n2300 and BOO b.c. 1 \n\nChristians pretended that St. Patrick explained the doctrine of the \nChristian trinity to the Irish by exhibiting the shamrock. However, \nthe Irish were worshipping this emblem of their Triple Goddess long \nbefore Christianity appeared in their land. It stood for her triple \n"door," and her God sometimes bore the title of Trefuilngid Tre- \n\n\n\n930 \n\n\n\neochair, "Triple Bearer of the Triple Key," a trident representing the \ntriple phallus. He was known as a God of the Shamrock, partially \nassimilated to Christianity by a legend that he appeared to the Irish on \nthe day of Christ\'s crucifixion, bearing sacred stone tablets and a branch \nwith three fruits. 2 \n\n1.

Shayba was the "Old \nWoman" whose spirit dwelt in the sacred stone of the Kaaba in Mecca. \nSheba was the land-name and Goddess-name of Arabian queens in \nthe ancient seat of government, Marib, in southern Arabia (now \nYemen). Shebat was the Mesopotamian Moon-goddess (a variation \nof Hebat or Eve), and the month named after her. In Assyria the \nancient head of a family was called shebu, formerly a matriarch, later \na tribal elder of either sex. See Arabia. \n\n\n\nvar. Sheba, Shebat \n\n\n\nSheila-na-gig \n\nCarved representation of a naked woman squatting with her knees \napart, displaying her vulva, shown as a vesica piscis or double-pointed \noval. Sometimes the figure presented the vesica with both hands or \ndrew it open with one. Sheila-na-gig figures appeared all over old Irish \nchurches built before the 16th century. 1 Many were still in place \nduring the 19th century, but Victorian prudery defaced or destroyed \nlarge numbers of them. Some have been found buried near the \nchurches they once embellished. 2 \n\nSheila-na-gig figures closely resembled the yonic statues of Kali \nwhich still appear at the doorways of Hindu temples, where visitors \nlick a finger and touch the yoni "for luck." Some of the older figures \nhave deep holes worn in their yonis from much touching. 3 \n\nThe protruding ribcage on many examples of the sheila-na-gig \nimitates the figures of Kali as the death-goddess, Kalika, evidently \nremembered in Ireland as the Caillech or "Old Woman," who was also \nthe Creatress and gave birth to all races of men. 4 Celts generally \nprotected doorways with some female-genital fetish, which is why they \nsettled on the horseshoe, classic Omega-sign of the Kalika. In India it \nstood for the feminine cosmos within which Shiva ever performed his \ncreative sexual dance, although he was assimilated to the Kalika and \ngiven her title of Destroyer. 5 \n\nDerivation of the term sheila-na-gig is obscure. It meant some- \nthing like "vulva-woman." Gig or giggie meant female genitals and \nmay have been related to the Irish "jig," from French gigue, in \n\n\n\n931 \n\n\n\nShekina pre-Christian times an orgiastic dance. In ancient Erech a gig seems to \n\nShfol have been a holy yoni; the sacred harlots of the temple were known \n\n^^^^^^^^^^^ as nu-gig. 6 \n\nI F Huxley, 63. 2. G.R. Scott, 239-43. 3.

Cabalists said it \nwas God\'s loss of his Shekina that brought about all evils. The \nHebrew Sh\'kina meant "dwelling-place," a hint that God had no \n"home" without her. Like her Tantric counterpart the Shakti, the \nSh\'kina was the source of all "soul" in the universe. Gnostic Christians \nof the 4th century spoke of the Sh\'kina as a "spirit of glory" in whom \nBeings of Light lived, as children in their mother\'s body or house. Mani \nreferred to the Aeons as sh\'kinas, or female spirits of the sacred year. 1 \n\nCabalists taught that it was essential to bring male and female \ncosmic principles together again, which might be done by sexual \nmagic, signifying union of the sun (man) and moon (woman). This was \ngraphically expressed by the hexagram. Philosophy of the Cabala \nsaid the supernal mother Shekina is manifested in the earthly mother, \nwith whom her husband should lie on the Sabbath, because "all the \nsix days of the week derive their blessing" from this coupling. Rabbi \nEliahu di Vidas said, "Who has not experienced the force of \npassionate love for a woman will never attain to the love of God." 2 \n\nJewish mystics said the "outer garment" of the Shekina is Torah, \n"Holy Law." A man became a Bridegroom of Torah by study, \nsymbolized in erotic imagery. He must court her like a beautiful \nmaiden. "She begins from behind a curtain to speak words in keeping \nwith his understanding, until very slowly insight comes to him." The \nShekina as "Indwelling One" might be compared to the Latin I-dea, \nor Goddess Within. "She opens the door of her hidden chamber ever so \nlittle, and for a moment reveals her face to her lover, but hides it \n\nagain forthwith He alone sees it and he is drawn to her with his \n\nheart and soul and his whole being." 3 \n\nAs a man required his Shekina for enlightenment, so God required \nhis Shekina for wisdom and creativity. This crucial tenet of cabalistic \ndoctrine is seldom emphasized or even mentioned today. \n\n1. Jonas, 218, 98. 2. Lederer, 187. 3.

Sacred kings who died on trees went \nto this other world. The Markandeya Purana mentioned an under- \nground realm where men\'s souls were impaled on trees. 2 \n\nShal-Mari probably became Sheol-Mari in the Middle East, where \nMari was Ishtar, and there was a long tradition of hanging human \nsacrifices on trees. \n\n1.

At Eleusis, the central Mystery \nwas "an ear of corn reaped in silence." J \n\nOld Testament writers supposed that the shibboleth was Astarte\'s \ndying-and-reborn god Baal. Shibboleth was used as a password \nbecause some tribes couldn\'t pronounce it (Judges 12:6). Patriarchal \nopposition to the symbol later made it synonymous with a false deity, \na meaning that remained up to the present time. \n\nl.d\'Alviella, 2. \n\n\n\nShin-Mu \n\n"Mother of Perfect Intelligence," China\'s Holy Virgin, who miracu- \nlously conceived her firstborn son, a Savior and spirit of the grain. Her \ninfant "came like a lamb, with no bursting or rending, with no hurt or \nharm," and was tenderly adored by sheep and oxen. 1 \n\nAfter producing this child, Shin-Mu resumed her archaic Great \nMother character and gave birth to 33,333 creatures. Patriarchal \nmyths deprived her of a vagina, and so insisted all these creatures were \nborn from her arms or breast. A Christian traveler in China explained \nShin-Mu\'s miraculous motherhood: she had "no place on her body \nwhence to bring them forth as other women of the world, whom for \nsin God hath subjected to filthiness of corruption, to show how filthy \nsin is." 2 \n\nAfter she was virginized and even deprived of a vagina, Shin-Mu\'s \nonly remaining connection with sexuality was similar to the virgin \nMary\'s: she continued to be the divine patroness of whores. 3 \n\nPersians diabolized her and called her Shimnu, the "Great Devil," \nso called in a Manichean Confession-Prayer found at Turfan and in \nthe Cave of a Thousand Buddhas, at Tun-huang. 4 \n\n1.

Both "navel" and "naval" once referred to the \nburial shrine likened to a ship and the Mother\'s womb at the same \ntime. The Norse death ship vessel of the famous "Viking funeral" \nwas called ludr, meaning boat, coffin, and cradle. 3 It took the dead \nback to their Mother-sea; the Norsemen\'s expression for "death" was \n"to return to the mother\'s womb." 4 The pagan Welsh similarly sent \ntheir dead back to the marine womb and called their funeral dirges \nmarwysgafen, "Giving-back-to-the-Sea-Mother." 5 The vessel of \ndeath and rebirth was always feminine, which may be why a ship is still \n"she." \n\nEgypt\'s Lord of Death, Osiris-Seker, was carried away in a boat \nunder the auspices of a priest entitled "great chief of the hammer," \nthe same title held by Thor. The god came to life again in the "morning \nboat," tended by a spirit named Matet, evidently the same as Mater \nMatuta, the Dawn-Mother. 6 Matet was an emanation of Isis the \nMother, to whom the solar boat was dedicated. \n\nRomans worshipped Isis as a ship-goddess, the boat being a symbol \nof her womb, each of her temples having a "bark of Isis" carved in \nstone at the entrance. The Roman temple where Isis\'s holy boat was \nkept became a Christian church under the name of Santa Maria della \nNavicella: Our Lady of the Boat. 7 Isis-figures in boats, kept in pagan \ntemples throughout Europe, gave rise to the curious fairy tale \ncollected by Grimm under the title of "The Witch in the Stone Boat." \n\nMany "witches" or Goddess-figures appeared in boats even during| \nthe nominally Christian era. A 1 2th-century chronicler spoke of \nsinging, dancing processions that followed sacred ships mounted on \nwheels, containing as he put it "I know not what evil genius." 8 One \nsuspects the chronicler knew perfectly well that the wheeled ship \ncontained a pagan Goddess. Up to the late Middle Ages, the \nGoddess\'s wheeled ship was drawn through the streets of Flemish town* \nby the weavers\' guilds, accompanied by half-naked male and female \ndancers whose behavior, churchmen said, was "scandalously bacchana- \nlian." 9 The Midsummer festival at Douai in 1770 featured a huge \nWheel of Fortune, emblem of the Fate-goddess, and a dry-land ship \nfilled with people who made "strange gestures," recalling the images \nof ancestral spirits in the ship of Arianrhod which was also a star- \nwheel. 10 See Wheel. \n\nShips were associated with orgiastic rites from the earliest manifes- \ntations of the ship as a womb symbol and an earthly imitation of the \n\n\n\n934 \n\n\n\ncrescent moon. Oriental sages called the moon "the Ark or vessel of \nboat-like shape, symbol of fertility or the Container of the Germ of all \nlife." 11 \n\n1. Neumann, G.M., 254-55. 2. Oxenstierna, 34. 3.

Like the Great Goddess whose \nson, lover, and victim he was, Shiva had many names. Sometimes he \nalone was a trinity, or a three-headed god, bearer of the trident or triple \nphallus which enabled him to mate with the Triple Mother. 1 \n\nShiva was "in a state of actualization because he is in bodily \ncontact with his own universal energy, the Shakti, the Goddess, the \nfeminine active principle, the efficient and material cause of the uni- \nverse, the Maya that evolves the differentiated elements and beings. \nSakala Shiva bears on his head the crescent of the moon." 2 \n\nShiva was called Lord of Yoga, i.e., of the "yoke" that bound him \nto the Goddess. He was also Lord of Death, called Shava, the \nCorpse, prostrate under the feet of Kali as she devoured his entrails a \nHindu parallel of the dead Osiris shown as the Still-Heart, a mummy, \ndead and yet alive. 3 \n\nAmong Shiva\'s many other titles were Great Lord, Lord of the \nDance, Lord of Cattle (Pasupati), Beneficent One (Sankara), Lord \nWho Is Half Woman (Ardhanarisvara), God with the Moon in His \nHair (Candrasekhara), He Who Belongs to the Triple Goddess, He \nWho Gives and Takes Away, Consort of the Goddess Uma, Con- \ndemned One, Destroyer, Howler. 4 \n\nTantric yogis insisted that their supreme Shiva was the only god, \nand all other gods were only inferior imitations of him. He was \ncertainly older than the Vedic heaven-gods. A deity like Shiva was \nshown under the feet of a Kali-like squatting Goddess on Sumerian \ncylinder seals of 2300 B.C. 5 Cultures of Sumeria and the Indus valley \nwere in contact at very early periods. Shiva\'s worshippers may have \nbeen literally correct in viewing other gods as recent upstarts. Some of \ntheir scriptures claimed that Brahma and Vishnu were so puny that \nthey couldn\'t even realize the limits of Shiva\'s cosmic lingam (phallus). 6 \n\nAs a sexual god, Shiva epitomized the Tantric ideal of maithuna, \ninsuring the orgasmic pleasure of his partner while controlling his \nown, to partake of her sexual energy. He advocated the female-superior \nposition also favored by such Middle-Eastern Goddesses as Hecate, \nLilith, and Asherah the position usually forbidden by patriarchs. 7 The \nBrahmana Purana said the female-superior position was a "reversal" \n\n\n\nPuranas are \nancient Sanskrit \nscriptures in verse, \ntreating of cosmologies, \nsacred histories, and the \nnature of the divine. \n\n\n\n935 \n\n\n\nSkkfurttu Gautama \n\n\n\npracticed by Shiva and lusted after by the "daughters of the sages" of \nold; but proper Brahmans must regard it as a perversion. 8 \n\nVedic myths portray hostility between Brahma and Shiva, even \nthough the two were eventually regarded as components of the same \ntrinity. Shiva\'s priests claimed that Brahmadeva (Brahma-god) was \nnothing more than a servant of Shiva under his archaic name of \nRudra Mokshakala, "Liberated Black Rudra." Brahmans retaliated by \nbelittling Shiva as "an evil yogi," whose cult was only "worship of the \nlingam"; if Brahma was Shiva\'s servant, at least the servant didn\'t take \nup the same "self-indulgence" or "hideous activities" as the master. \nLike western underground gods, Shiva was easily diabolized because he \nwas already the Great Black One (Mahakala), confused with Yama \nand Ganesha, the Lord of Hosts, who begot his reincarnations on \nMaya-Kali. 9 \n\nAs Lord of the Dance, Shiva represented one of Hinduism\'s most \nsubtle concepts. He copied Kali\'s Dance of Life, supposedly directing \nand controlling by its rhythm the constant movement in time and space \nof all material things. Shiva performed this dance in a place called \nChidambaram, the "Center of the Universe"; but the location of this \nplace is within the human heart. 10 The sages\' implications were that \n(1) the heartbeat is the basic rhythm to which all human music is \nrelated, because it is heard even by the unborn infant in the paradise- \nstate of intrauterine life, and it is never forgotten; and (2) each human \nbeing secretly regards his own heart as the center of the universe \nindeed, therefore the god is located within the core of man\'s own self. \n\nShiva was seldom depicted alone, for his power depended on his \nunion with Kali, his feminine energy, without whom he could not \nact. The puzzling vision of Shiva as Shava the Corpse, under the \nGoddess\'s feet, illustrated the "doctrine that Shiva without his Shakti \ncan do and is, so far as the manifested is concerned, nothing." Yet \njoined to the Goddess, he became the Bindu or spark of creation. \nEvery human orgasm was believed to share in this creative experience \nas "an infinitesimally small fragment and faint reflection of the \ncreative act in which Shiva and Shakti join to produce the Bindu which \nis the seed of the universe." n A Tantric yogi in sexual union with his \nyogini or Shakti could attain the experience of yoga, "linking" himself \nwith godhood, and in his ecstasy exclaim Shivaham "I Am \nShiva." 12 \n\n1.

In the Loka- \nsenna, Odin was reproached for practicing seidr because it was a \nfemale craft, property of the Goddess. 5 The Lapps worshipped the seidi \n(spirit-power) of their deities. 6 The Celts called their matriarchal \nfairy-lore sidh, pronounced "she."

The queen died in giving birth to \nSiegfried, who was set afloat on the river in a vessel of glass and taken \nashore by a doe, who nursed him until he was found by the smith \nMimir, who raised him. According to another story, Siegfried was \nnursed by a she-wolf, and his early name was Wolfdietrich. 1 \n\nSiegfried\'s later adventures are the subject matter of the Nibelung- \nenlied and other epic romances: how he slew the dragon Fafnir and \nmarried Brunnhilde ("Burning Hel"), and was slain in a typical Liebes- \ntod (Love-Death) after which he was reunited with his mystic bride. \nHe was a Germanic Heracles, with many elements of the sun-hero. \n\n1.

Out of her was born the first Word; this was the \nLogos of creation. Like Mother Night, she stood at the beginning of \nall things and represented the state of chaos or nonexistence before the \nuniverse took form. See Sophia, Saint. \n\n\n\nClementine Homi- \nlies Greek writings \nfalsely attributed to a \nfirst-century bishop of \nRome; actually com- \nposed by an anonymous \nChristian apologist \ntoward the end of the \n4th century. \n\n\n\nSimon Magus \n\n"Simon the Mage" was one of the principal rivals of the Christians\' \ncult-hero in the first century a.d. The Clementine Homilies said Simon \nwas one of the Essenes, and a disciple of John the Baptist, and the \nfounder of Gnostic Christianity. Simon was said to have appeared in \nSamaria as God the Father, in Palestine as the Son, and in the rest of \nthe nations as the Holy Spirit. He was even canonized, in the guise of a \n"St. Simon" allegedly chosen "bishop of Jerusalem" in 62 a.d., after \nleading a group of Essenic eremites in the village of Pella, beyond \nJordan. Followers of Simon were still numerous in the 4th century \n\nA.D.\' \n\nFrom the orthodox viewpoint, the trouble with Simon was that his \nsect welcomed women and held that the world-creating power was as \nmuch female as male. Simon\'s heaven was sevenfold, after the classic \npattern, and ruled by three pairs of male-and-female Powers, Roots, \nor Aeons, all born of a great female source with the power of concep- \ntion, the origin of all things. Simon said God the Father came out of \nher, and was not called Father until she had named him Father. 2 \n\nSimon traveled with a sacred harlot named Helen, whom he called \nhis First Thought (Ennoia). She was a reincarnation of Helen of \nTroy, Inanna, Athene, and other Goddesses. Simon claimed that, with \nher, in his former god-incarnation he had created the world. Simon- \nians worshipped her as Sophia, the Gnostic Virgin of Light, and insisted \nthat she had mothered Jesus. As a Holy Whore (Prunikos), she \nrepresented the fallen Ennoia for whose sake God descended and \nclothed himself in flesh, in the person of Simon. "World salvation \nwas bound up with her redemption by him." 3 \n\nSimonians said those who placed their faith in Simon and Helen \nwould be saved by this grace, without need of works. The relationship \nbetween Simon and Helen was like that of the Gnostic Christ and his \nsacred harlot Mary Magdalene, who was similarly called Pistis- \nSophia-Prunikos (Faith- Wisdom- Whore). She embodied Sophia, who \nwas Jesus\'s spouse in heaven. 4 Gnostic Gospels said Jesus gave the \nmystic secret of the keys to the kingdom of heaven not to Peter, but to \nMary; and Peter reacted with jealousy and hostility toward Mary and \nall women. 5 \n\nPeter was also hostile toward Simon Magus. According to the Acts \n\n\n\n938 \n\n\n\nof the Apostles, Peter rebuked Simon for trying to buy the apostles\' Simon Magus \n\nsecret of "laying on of hands" to cure diseases and cast out devils (Acts \n\n8:18). From this biblical tale came the term simony buying and ^^i^ \n\nselling priestly benefices and powers a sin to which the medieval heirs \n\nof "Peter" were especially prone. The author or authors of Acts had \n\nno good to say of Simon, who was called a false prophet, one who \n\n"bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some \n\ngreat one: to whom they all gave heed . . . saying, This man is the great \n\npower of God" (Acts 8:9-10). \n\nLike Peter, Simon was supposed to have visited Rome and \nimpressed the crowned heads with his miracles. Christians invented a \nstory about Simon to explain the inscription on a statue of the old \nSabine god Semo Sancus. The inscription was Semoni deo sancto, \nwhich some semiliterate "authority" rendered The Holy God Simon, \nclaiming that the statue was raised by Nero in honor of Simon \nMagus, after Simon allowed himself to be beheaded by Nero\'s execu- \ntioner. Then, by magic art, he substituted a ram for himself, and on \nthe third day rose from the dead before Nero, after the manner of all \nsavior-gods. 6 \n\nThe Acts of Peter and Paul asserted that Simon flew over the \nCampus Martius in a chariot drawn by winged demons. In the midst \nof his triumph, his enemy Peter recited a magic formula that caused him \nto fall and break his neck. 7 During the 8th century, Pope Paul I built \na church "on the exact spot" where Simon Magus fell to his death the \nexact spot having been discovered through a private revelation from \nthe Holy Ghost. In 850, Pope Leo IV reconstructed this church and \nnamed it Santa Maria Nova the New Holy Mary. \n\nAfter his death, Simon was succeeded by another Gnostic hero, \nMenander, "Moon-man." 8 This seems to have been a reincarnated \nSimon, assimilated to the moon. The rivalry between Peter and Simon- \nMenander suggests the battles between those Christians who \nworshipped the Essenic sun god whose priests were Pater, Petra, or \nPeter and those who worshipped the lunar hero. The controversy \nsuggests a schismatic breaking away from a parent cult: it must be \nremembered that Peter\'s name was Simon before Jesus changed it to \nPeter (Matthew 10:2), and that Peter too was a "Mage." \n\nThe Magi discovered the advent of Jesus by astrological magic, \naccording to the Christian story; this was put forth as one of the \nproofs of Jesus\'s divinity. Therefore, Christians were reluctant to dis- \ncredit any of the Magi. In Simon\'s case however, the early fathers \nwere implacably opposed to the main feature of his doctrine: "the \nearthly incarnation of the heavenly mother. . . . Leaders of the ortho- \ndox Church fought from the very beginning of Christianity against such \nglorification of women." 9 Writings attributed to Simon made exten- \nsive use of feminine symbols: paradise was the womb, Eden the \nplacenta. "The river that flows forth from Eden symbolizes the navel, \n\n\n\n939 \n\n\n\nSin \n\nSirens \n\n\n\nwhich nourishes the fetus [T]he Exodus, consequently, signifies the \n\npassage out of the womb, and . . . \'the crossing of the Red Sea refers \nto the blood.\' " 10 Such feminine imagery linked Simon with priests of \nthe Old Religion. In Ireland he was known as Simon the Druid. 11 \n\nThe Latin cognomen Faustus, "Favored One," was bestowed on \nSimon early in the Christian era. "The fact that he was accompanied \nby a Helena whom he claimed to be the reborn Helen of Troy shows \nclearly that we have here one of the sources of the Faust legend of \nthe early Renaissance. Surely few admirers of Marlowe\'s and Goethe\'s \nplays have an inkling that their hero is the descendant of a gnostic \nsectary, and that the beautiful Helen called up by his art was once the \nfallen Thought of God through whose raising mankind was to be \nsaved." 12 \n\n1.

He \nruled the Land of Sinim (Isaiah 49:12), which meant "land of the \nlunar mountain" and was an older form of Zion. His Chaldean name \nwas Kingu. He was the god who received the Tablets of Law from \nthe primal Mother of Creation, Tiamat. As Moses\'s god, he still had \nthe same mountain-throne and the same tablets. A biblical scholar has \npointed out that "the Jehovah of the Hebrews" was merely another \ntransformation of "the primitive lunar deity of Arabia." \' \n\nThe god Moses met on Mount Sinai claimed to be the god of \nAbraham, though he said Abraham knew him by a different name \n(Exodus 6:3). In fact, Abraham may have been the same deity. Very \nancient documents used the name Abraham or Ab-ram as a synonym \nfor Ab-Sin, Moon-father. 2 In the 1 2th century B.C., the Babylonian \nheaven was ruled by a trinity consisting of Shamash, Sin, and Ishtar, \nrepresented by the sun, moon, and stars. 3 \n\n1.

Scatha, Scotia \n\nThe Celto-Teutonic Goddess in her "Destroyer" aspect. Like the \nGreek Persephone, "Destroyer," she was Queen of the Shades, Mother \nDeath. Her name was the root of Gothic skadus, Old English sceadu, \n"shadow, shade." She was the Shadow into which all the gods went at \ndoomsday, called Gotterdammerung, or Going-Into-the-Shadow-of- \nthe-Gods. 1 As Scotia, she was the Dark Goddess like Black Kali, the \nCaillech after whom Scotland was named. 2 \n\nLike Kali, Skadi had to be propitiated each year with an outpouring \nof male blood in primitive sacrificial rites. Her annual victim was \nassimilated to the god Loki, who became a "savior" by fertilizing Skadi \nwith his blood. Loki\'s genitals were attached by a rope to a goat, and a \ntug-of-war ensued, until Loki\'s flesh gave way and he fell into Skadi\'s \nlap, thus bathing her loins in his blood. The gods watched anxiously \nto see if Skadi smiled; and when she did, it means spring could return \nonce more to the land. 3 \n\nSimilar blood-rites were practiced all over the ancient world, when \nmen sought godhood by giving their blood to the Goddess, before \nanimal sacrifices replaced human ones, and even afterward. It was not \nuncommon for priestesses representing the Goddess to bathe in \nsacrificial blood, like the women who sacrificed Apis the bull-god in \nEgypt, hoisting their skirts as they dismembered him so his spurting \nblood would quicken their wombs. 4 Like many death-goddess figures, \nSkadi collected the penises of her castrated heroes, and in this \ncharacter she was named Mornir, "troll-woman." 5 \n\nRemnants of the bloody sacrifice of Loki and the goat could still be \nfound in Norway and Sweden in the late 1 7th century. Churchmen \nvainly denounced the masquerades, sexual promiscuity, and "goat \ngames" associated with Easter and other religious festivals. 6 \n\nSkadi was a dark twin of Freya, therefore virtually identical with \nthe underground Goddess Hel. She was once all the Earth, birth- \ngiver and devourer of her children. The entire land mass of Scandinavia \nwas named after her. Originally it was Scadin-auja, the land of Skadi. 7 \n\nA variation of her name, Skuld, was given to the third of the three \nFates, or Norns, in the role of destroying Crone. Naturally she \nbecame the patroness of witches, whose activities came to be called \n"skulduggery." \n\nTo the Celts, she was Scatha or Scath. Her underground realm of \nthe dead was "the Land of Scath." Like Persephone\'s underworld \n\n\n\n941 \n\n\n\nSkakJ within seven loops of the Styx, the Land of Scath was a city of seven \n\nSlavery walls. 8 It was variously located under the earth, or in heaven, or far \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ away over the sea on a western island, the land of "Sky." Cu Chulainn \nand other Celtic heroes learned magic skill in martial arts from a visit \nto Queen Scatha\'s island of Skye. She kept the hero for "a year and a \nday," the usual mythic image of the old 1 3-month lunar year with its \nintercalary day. When she had taught a man all she knew, she sent him \nback to earth a fey man, set apart and sacer, fated to do great deeds \nand die a sacrificial death. 9 The legend suggests that the real island of \nSkye was a cult center of the Goddess, and warriors went there to be \ninitiated into their heroic profession. \n\nSkadi is still invoked by place names in Sweden, such as Skadave \n(Skadi\'s temple) and Skadalungr (Skadi\'s grove). 10 \n\n1.

A great skald was believed to have words of \npower; what he sang or prophesied would come true. He was able to \naddress the death goddess herself, via funerary ballads, and appeal to her \nto treat the deceased well. Norse sagas and eddaic poetry were the \nwork of skalds who belonged to a priestly class, like druids. See \nRomance. \n\n\n\nSlavery \n\nThe de Paors wrote naively of the life of a slave in early Christian \nIreland: "Even if he was a slave he had the advantage of living in a \nsociety which had accepted the teachings of Christianity." \' This \nwasn\'t much of an advantage, considering that in pagan society he \nwould not have been a slave at all. The United States in the 19th \ncentury had also accepted the teachings of Christianity, but this was of \nlittle benefit to the slaves on southern plantations. \n\nIn effect, the feudalism upheld by the Christian churches was a \nslave state. Serfs were at the mercy of their overlords, who held the \npower of life and death over them. Serfs could be bought and sold with \nthe land. Though they were taxed to support the church and the \nnobility, they were without legal rights. The "teachings" of Christianity \npaid no attention to the plight of the serfs, nor did the churches make \nany effort to alleviate their sufferings. \n\nChurch fathers were even more concerned to keep women in a \nstate of subjection throughout all social strata, so that each male even \nat the slave level had at least one slave of his own: a wife. St. Augustine \n\n\n\n942 \n\n\n\nlid wives should be slaves to their husbands, and husbands had the Sleipnir \n\nright to beat and abuse them. To a wife who had been beaten he would Smashana-Kali \n\nsay, "It is the duty of servants to obey their masters. . . . [Y]ou have ^^^^^^^^^^ \n\nmade a contract of servitude." 2 St. Thomas Aquinas said a male slave \nwas superior to a wife, because a male slave was not in subjection \n"according to the law of nature," but a wife was "subject to the man on \naccount of the weakness of her nature, both of mind and body." 3 In \nother words, Aquinas believed that might makes right; weakness must be \ndominated by strength. Of course this was not always the rule in all- \nmale relationships, only in male-female ones. \n\nThe combination of slavery and sexism in Christian societies made \nthe lot of female slaves particularly onerous. They were completely \nhelpless in the hands of their masters, and could be raped, tortured, or \nmurdered with impunity. Even in "enlightened" 19th-century \nAmerica, female slaves were in a singularly unenviable position. \n\nDr. James Marion Sims, known as the American "father of \ngynecology," was famed as the inventor of a surgical technique for \ncuring vesicovaginal fistula. He also performed hundreds of clitoridecto- \nmies and ovariotomies to cure "sex-related diseases" in women. \nWhat is usually not told about his career is the way he developed his \ntechniques. Before the Civil War, he kept women slaves in a disused \njailhouse and made them his guinea pigs, performing hundreds of \nexperimental and exploratory operations on them until they died off \none by one and were replaced by fresh victims. 4 Sims\'s career and \nwritings bear out what some psychologists have suspected, that early \ngynecological surgeons were fundamentally women-haters with a sadis- \ntic bent. \n\nIn patriarchal societies, said Marx, "Woman\'s true qualities are \nwarped to her disadvantage, and all the moral and delicate elements \nin her nature become the means for enslaving her and making her \nsuffer." 5 \n\n1. de Paor, 100. 2.

Skalds called the gallows "high- \nchested rope-Sleipnir," carrying men to the land of death. The same \nword meant "gallows tree" and "horse" (drasil). 1 See Horse; Odin. \n\nl.Turville-Petre,48. \n\n\n\nSmashana-Kali \n\nKali Ma as the Goddess of cremation grounds and other places of \ndeath. The yantra (symbol) of Smashana-Kali was doubly yonic: an \n\n\n\n943 \n\n\n\nSmith \n\n\n\neight-petaled lotus with multiple repetitions of the inverted triangle \nthat meant "female genitals." 1 The meaning of the yantra of Smashana- \nKali was rebirth following death. Her priestesses, called dakinis, \narranged funerals and tended the dying. In the after-world they became \npsychopomps. \n\n1 . Muhnnirvunatantm, 360. \n\n\n\nSmith \n\nA recurrent story about Amazons was that they deliberately crippled \ncertain men, members of a special caste of metalworkers and smiths \nwhose deformity became their caste mark. The Amazonian smith- \ngod Hephaestus was lame. Some said he was lamed when Zeus cast him \ndown from heaven to the underworld for trying to defend his mother \nHera. Others said he was lamed by Hera herself. Hephaestus shared a \ntemple with Athene, renowned as an instructress of smiths. She \ntaught smithcraft to Daedalus, the builder of the Cretan Labyrinth. 1 \n\nMany myths point to a continuing relationship between smithcraft \nand the worship of the Goddess. Egyptian priests of Isis were mesniu, \n"smiths." 2 Aphrodite ruled the copper mines and metalworking schools \nof her sacred isle, Cyprus ("Copper"). Medieval alchemists contin- \nued to call copper the Metal of Venus. The lame smith Hephaestus also \nclaimed Aphrodite as his bride. The primal sea-goddesses loved him, \ndespite his deformity. "Golden women" helped him in his workshop on \nthe isle of Lemnos, traditional home of militant Amazons. 3 \n\nSmiths often claimed magic powers stemming from secret connec- \ntion with the feminine forces of nature. Roman faber meant both \n"smith" and "magician." Russian folk tales portrayed smiths as assistants \nof witches. Exorcisms attributed to St. Patrick claimed to avert the \nspells of "women, smiths, and druids." 4 The Yakuts said "Smiths and \nshamans are from the same nest," believing smiths could heal, \nprophesy, and work miracles. Secret societies linking metallurgy and \nmagic appear in the traditions of China and Japan, as in those of \nmedieval alchemists, craft fraternities, and German Mannerbunde. 5 \n\nThe German name Schmidt (Smith) once referred to a priestly \ncaste of metalworking shamans, who were also bards. Their apotheo- \nsized founder was Wayland the Smith in Scandinavia, Volund a \nconsort of the Triple Goddess. He encountered her in totemic form, \nas three doves flying above a sacred spring. 6 \n\nEnglish tradition said Wayland the Smith lived within the Berk- \nshire hill marked by the 370-foot image of the White Horse of \nUffington. If horses were brought to him at night and left, with money, \nat one of the standing stones, he would shoe them before the coming \nof the dawn. 7 \n\nMongols said the seven stars of Ursa Major which the Hindus \ncalled Seven Rishis were the skulls of seven smiths who had been \n\n\n\n944 \n\n\n\nraised to the sky by the Goddess. The constellation was a special patron Snake \n\nof smiths. 8 Christian folklore said the man in the moon was Cain, Sneeze \n\nwhose name meant "smith"; the Cainites or Kenites were the special ^^^-^^^^^^ \n\ncaste of metalworkers in ancient Palestine, until they were driven out \nof the country (1 Samuel 13:19). See Cain. \n\nThe Irish said the celestial smith was Luno (Moon-man), a lame \ncraftsman like Hephaestus. He made Fingal\'s magic sword. 9 Merlin \ntoo was a smith; he forged Arthur\'s magic armor. 10 Christian syncretism \neven represented the God who impregnated the virgin Mary as "the \nSmith from above" who threw his hammer into her breast probably a \nnew version of Thor, as an apotheosized Wayland. 11 \n\nWhen the old gods were made devils, smithcraft was associated \nwith devil\'s work. Numerous cathedral bells were said to have been \nforged by the devil. 12 The devil was also the Master Smith who forged \nthe original ironwork doors of Notre Dame de Paris, which were \nreplaced by new doors in I860. 13 \n\nGypsies were often described as smiths, and many adopted the \nsurname of Smith. 14 The prejudice against ironworkers included \ngypsies. This prejudice was particularly notable in Abyssinia where \nironworkers were restricted to a special caste, excluded from the rites \nof the church, and believed to possess the evil eye. 15 \n\nAlong with the smiths, other medieval European craft guilds were \nconsidered subversive by Christian orthodoxy. The guild of free \nmasons, for example, maintained their own ceremonies, secrets, and \nsemi-religious doctrine. "The Church, not without the semblance of \nreason, will regard the Masonic brotherhood as her most treacherous \nand dangerous enemy, which aims to dismantle her work and \nreconstruct it in another spirit." 16 The smiths\' guilds were even more \nsuspect at one time, to the point where the church even felt it \nnecessary to dissolve some of them. \n\n1.

The \nold expression was "Jupiter preserve you" or "Jupiter help me." \' Its \nbasis was the ancient Indo-European concept of the air-soul or breath- \nsoul (Atman), which might be expelled from the body by a violent \n\n\n\n945 \n\n\n\nSolomon and Sheba rush of air unless prevented by a verbal charm. Covering the mouth \n\nduring a yawn arose from the same fear of losing the soul. Medieval \n\n^^^^^^^^^^ churchmen accepted the superstition, and taught that both sneezing and \nyawning should be immediately protected by the sign of the cross, \nbecause "Ofttimes a man sneezed, and expired at the moment of \nsneezing. ... In like manner it often befell that a man yawned, and \nfell dead." 2 \n\nThe primitive idea of the air-soul was closely associated with \nsneezing by the Polynesians. The first man on earth was kneaded of \nred clay moistened with the deity\'s blood that is, the same combina- \ntion of menstrual blood and earth that ancient Semites called \nadamah and was animated by the deity\'s breath. Then the clay effigy \ncame to life and sneezed. The name of this first man was Tiki-ahua, \nor The Creator\'s Sneeze. Ahua, or "likeness," was a sound-word for \n"sneeze." 3 Thus the man made "in God\'s image" was the same as a \nman made "by God\'s sneeze." \n\nThe Christian custom of saying "God bless you" to a sneezer was \nmeant to serve as shorthand for extreme unction, in the event that \nthe soul happened to leave the body. Hindus still take similar precau- \ntions when someone yawns. They snap their fingers to frighten the \nsoul away from the open mouth and back down the throat where it \nbelongs. \n\n1. de Lys, 305. 2. de Voragine, 278. 3. Frazer, EOT., 5. \n\n\n\nSolomon and Sheba \n\nSolomon meant Sun God of On, the Jewish version of Ra of \nHeliopolis. 1 Solomon was the one Jewish king with pretensions to ruling \na Golden Age of glory. The wonders of his reign were attributed to \nhis wisdom, supposedly the gift of Yahweh, though the Bible inconsist- \nentfy declares that Solomon didn\'t worship Yahweh. Solomon\'s \nfamous temple was built not by himself but by King Hiram of Tyre, to \nwhom Solomon was forced to pay tribute (1 Kings 5:1 1). The deities \nworshipped in that temple were the Tyrian sun god Melek or Heracles- \nMelkart (biblical Molech); Shamash the sun god (biblical Chemosh); \nand the Goddess Astarte, or Ashtoreth, whom Yahweh\'s priests called \nan abomination (1 Kings 1 1:5-7). \n\nIn reality, there was no Golden Age of Solomon. No contempo- \nrary nation took any notice of Israel\'s alleged glory. The "great cities" \nSolomon was supposed to have built were small mud-hut villages. The \n"city" of Megiddo covered less than 13 acres. "The standard of living \nwas far from luxurious when compared to that prevailing in other parts \nof the ancient Near Eastern world." 2 \n\nSolomon\'s reign was set in the middle of the 10th century B.C., but \\ \nthe Hebrew manuscript used as a basis for the biblical account was \nwritten in the 10th century a.d., 2000 years later though a few early- \n\n\n\n946 \n\n\n\nmedieval copies of a Greek text might have gone as far back as the \nI 3rd century B.C. There were no records whatever traceable to Solo- \nmon\'s own time, not even the king lists that were customary in the \nI nations that amounted to anything. Like David, Solomon was arbitrarily \nassigned a reign of forty years because that was the traditional span of \n, a generation. 3 \n\nSolomon\'s reign and deeds must be interpreted as a collection of \nlegends from Egypt, Phoenicia, and especially from southern Arabia, \nthe land of Sheba, where a true Golden Age was flourishing under a \nsuccession of matriarchal queens. Sheba was the primary source of \nfrankincense and other valuable spices, in great demand not only for \nfood preservation but also for religious and funerary use. \n\nEutychius said the whole Sinai peninsula had been governed by \nwealthy Sheban queens for as long as anyone could remember. In the \nalleged time of Abraham, Queen Shabib (Sheba) had "built Nisib and \nEdessa and surrounded them with walls. She founded also the \nsanctuary of Harran, and made an idol of gold, called Sin." 4 This was \nthe Moon-god of Mount Sinai, the god of Moses. Semitic tribes of \nArabia worshipped the moon and her earthly embodiment, the queen, \nsince at least the 16th century B.C. 5 Sheba was the lunar queen\'s \ncapital, also known to the Egyptians as Punt or Ophir, famous as a land \nof fabulous wealth. 6 \n\nThere were king consorts in Sheba\'s capital city of Marib (Mar- \niaba), but they were forbidden to leave the queen\'s palace on pain of \ndeath by stoning. 7 The city, hub of the spice trade, had a great moon \ntemple at Almaqah, laid out in the feminine-symbolic oval character- \nistic of matriarchal religious centers. Priestesses of this temple appear in \nthe Old Testament as "Sabeans" (Shebans). They were described as \nholy harlots from the "wilderness," the biblical name for any place \noutside of Israel, having crowns on their heads and jeweled bracelets \non their arms (Ezekiel 23:42). Sheban priests were called mukarrib, \n"kindred of the moon," from which descended the Hebrew kerubh \n(cherub, angel) and the Arabic muqanibin, "close kindred," a title of \nmedieval Sufi mystics. 8 \n\nThe Bible presents a highly improbable picture of a rich Queen \nof Sheba coming with a caravan of spices, gold, and precious stones to \nvisit a king of poor, backward Israel. She loaded Solomon with gifts \nbecause she was so impressed by what he already owned and by his \nclever answers to her questions (1 Kings 10:5). Needless to say, this \nwas only mythic name-dropping. Solomon was placed on his throne and \ncrowned by a Sheban moon-priestess called Bath-Sheba (Daughter of \nSheba), said to be his mother (Song of Solomon 3:1 1). The king \nwhether his name was Solomon or not clearly lived in a more \ndependent relationship to the Sheban matriarchate than the account of \nthe queen\'s visit might suggest. \n\nAccording to the Koran, Solomon stole his throne from Balkis, \nQueen of Sheba. 9 The name Balkis, Bilqis, or Balqama is thought to \n\n\n\nSolomon and Sheba \n\n\n\nEutychius Greek \nhistorian, author of a se- \nries of Annals. \n\n\n\n947 \n\n\n\nSolomon and Sheba be related to Greek pallakis, "sacred harlot." The Marib temple was \nMahram Bilqis, Moon-Mother Bilqis, the formal name of the God- \n^^^^^^^^^^ dess-queen. Set in the doorway of the temple was a large bronze \n\nbaptismal basin filled with water, the prototype of the "brazen sea" in \nSolomon\'s temple, copied from Sheban antecedents. 10 This mighty \nwomb-symbol was decorated with the female yonic emblems of \nknops and lilies, also "cherubim," derived from the Sheban \nmukarribim. n \n\nSolomon\'s temple featured a pair of phallic pillars named Boaz \n(eagerness, strength) and Jachin (God makes him firm), surmounted \nby female symbols of lilies and pomegranates (1 Kings 7:19-20). By thi \nancient symbolism, the two pillars at the temple door represented the \nking and his tanist, both craving entrance into the Enclosed Garden or \ntemple-body of the Goddess. The hieros gamos between Solomon \nand his mysterious black queen a marriage arranged by Bath-Sheba \nwas a mating of the king to his land, signalized by pornographic \nhymns like the wedding-poems of ancient Sumeria. 12 \n\nThe fragment of love-liturgy now called Solomon\'s Song has beei \nan embarrassment to theologians, even though they strenuously \ninsisted it was an allegory of Christ\'s love for his church, Lady Ecclesia. \nIt was hard to explain why such a love should exude such a steamy air \nof obviously erotic sensualism. Yet the 18th-century scholar Herder was \npersecuted and hounded from one pastorate to another for daring to \nsuggest that Solomon\'s love poem should be accepted at face value, as a \npiece of Oriental erotica. 13 \n\nWhen the metaphors of this poem are unraveled, they prove to b< \nmore, not less, frankly sexual. The hortus conclusus or "enclosed \ngarden" is the internal genitalia of the virgin bride, where her spouse \n"enters paradise" from Hebrew pardes, "garden." 14 Solomon says, \n"A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain \nsealed." He proposes to unseal her, unlock her door, and "drink of \nspiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate" (Song of Solomon 8:2). \nThis metaphor is explained by the contemporary image of the \npomegranate, rimmon, as a female-genital symbol. Spiced wine meant \nthe secretion of the Goddess representing the blood of life: i.e., \nmenstrual blood, of which only kings and gods could taste. 15 \n\nSolomon\'s bride said invitingly, "Let my beloved come into his \ngarden, and eat his pleasant fruits." Solomon answered, "Open to \nme, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled \nwith dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. I have put off my \ngarment; how shall I put it on?" The king\'s dew-filled "head" was the \ncommon symbol of the penis, in royal wedding hymns of Sumer and \nAkkad. A king\'s union with the Goddess Inanna, Queen of the \nUniverse, was so described: "The king goes with lifted head to the \nholy lap, he goes with lifted head to the holy lap of Inanna." Every \nking\'s divine bride was Inanna "the queen, the vulva of heaven and \nearth." 16 \n\n\n\n948 \n\n\n\nA priestess impersonated the Goddess on the royal wedding night. Solomon and Sheba \n\nSolomon\'s mysterious "black, but beautiful" bride, the Shulamite, \n\nseems to have been no more than an ancient Canaanite title of the ^ ^ m wm \n\nGoddess, Zulumat, "Darkness." 17 Like the Goddess she was not \nonly the night and the moon; she was also the land and its crops. Her \nstature was like a palm tree, her breasts like clusters of grapes, her \nmouth like honeycomb, her teeth like flocks of sheep, her belly a heap \nof wheat set with lilies, and so on. In short she was the Enclosed \nGarden-paradise of Oriental kings, like Shalimar in the Far East the \nSemitic Sheol-Mari, or Mary of the enchanted garden underground. \n\nSimilarly the Enclosed Garden became a Christian symbol of the \nsame Mary. The Litany of the Virgin jumbled together many of the \nold fertility symbols, calling Mary the Enclosed Garden, Well of Water, \nGate of Heaven, Chosen Vessel, City of God, Beautiful Moon, \nBeloved of the Sun, Rose, Lily, Olive, and Palm. 18 Within the Virgin\'s \nhortus conclusus dwelt such phallic symbols as the Tower of David, \nTree of Life, enchanted unicorn, and Exalted Cedar of Lebanon, \nalways called "tall." The ancient meaning of "tall" combined the \nconcepts of "prompt, quick, docile, comely, handsome" flattering \ndescriptions of the divine phallus. 19 \n\nMary or Mari was linked with the Sheban moon-temple at Marib, \nhaving the same name and the title of almah or moon-woman, once a \npriestess of the Almaqah. Solomon\'s mother Bath-Sheba, who crowned \nhim, apparently represented the elder queen of Sheba, who was also \nthe Naked Goddess when viewed in her bath by the next king. Her \nspouse David had come to kingship by viewing her in her bath and \nshowing a satisfactory reaction. Prior to Solomon\'s reign, the king\'s \ndefeated tanist was Absalom or "Father Salomon," variants of Salem, \nSalma, Shalem, or Solomon. After lying with the royal concubines to \nprove his virility, Absalom died a sacrificial death on an oak tree, and \na phallic pillar was erected in his honor (2 Samuel 18:18). Bath-Sheba \nmeant literally the daughter of Shaybah, an ancient Arabic name of \nthe Goddess. 20 See Zenobia. \n\nIn one year Solomon received 666 talents of gold (1 Kings 10:14), \nthe mystic number of the Triple Goddess, later re-interpreted by her \nenemies as "the number of the beast" (Revelation 13:18). Clearly, \nSolomon worshipped the Goddess (1 Kings 1 1:5) and paid little or no \nattention to Yahweh. Apocryphal texts said Yahweh never forgave \nSolomon\'s paganism, but after his death condemned him to perpetual \npunishment, like that of Prometheus: to be daily devoured, forever, by \n10,000 ravens. 21 \n\nThe gold that came to Solomon was probably a symbol of his \nwisdom; for kings\' wisdom was generally ascribed to their union with \nthe Goddess who represented "mother-wisdom" (Hebrew hok-mah, \nafter Egyptian hek-maa). Sargon II also claimed to have received \n"gold" form the Arabian queen. 22 Centuries later, Arabian alchemists \ntalked in highly esoteric terms of the acquisition of mystic gold, which \n\n\n\n949 \n\n\n\nSon of Man \n\n\n\nmay have meant something different from the usual interpretation of \nmaterial gold from base metal. In medieval alchemy much was made \nof the occult link between gold and the Wisdom-goddess, variously \nnamed Sophia, Sapientia, Anima Mundi, Athene, or Luna. \n\nSolomon\'s legendary wisdom brought him almost as much rever- \nence from medieval occultists as Thoth-Hermes Trismegistus, god of \nmagic. Several grimoires purported to have been written by his hand; \nThe Key of Solomon was one of the most popular. Magic signs like \nthe pentacle and hexagram were often called Solomon\'s Seal. "Of a \ntruth," the Grand Grimoire said of Solomon, "what other man, save \nthis invincible genius, would have had the hardihood to reveal the \nwithering words which God makes use of to strike terror into the \nrebellious angels and compel them into obedience?" 23 Thus wizards \ninvoked Solomon\'s help in calling up demons for magical purposes. \n\nThe Bible is remarkably uncommunicative concerning Solomon\'s \ndeath, considering the intimate detail that describes his wedding \nnight, his temple furnishings, his household, etc. The Arabs said \nSolomon lost his magic ring while bathing in the Jordan, and forgot \nhis wisdom, so he was killed by a djinniwho ruled in his place. Rabbinic \nwriters said Solomon\'s corpse was stuffed and shown to the people on \nholy days to make them think he still lived. One day the royal mummy \nembarrassingly fell apart, which ended the deception. 24 \n\n1. Stanton, 67. 2. Pritchard, S.S., 35.3. Pritchard, S.S., 10, 21. 4. Briffault 3, 108. \n\n5. Albright, 96. 6.

It was \ncoined to prove Vishnu a god made wholly in the image of man, having \nno need of a mother. 1 Yet Vishnu himself finally adopted the worship \nof Mother Kali, saying in his hymn to her divinity, "The gods them- \nselves are merely constructs out of Her maternal substance." 2 \n\n"Son of Man" was subsequently applied to the Persian Messiah, \nthen to the Essenic Christ, both of whom were "born" at the hands \nof men, "of water and of the spirit." Men so born were supposed to be \nable to defeat death, whereas man born of woman was fated to die. \nThe Persian Son of Man, Yima the Splendid (copied from the Vedic \nYama) became a Lord of Death, "the good shepherd, the most \nglorious of those who were born, the sole mortal possessor of the solar \neye." He alone could "render men and beasts non-mortal." ? \n\nRepeating a bit of Persian eschatology, Jesus promised that on the \nLast Day "the Son of man shall come in the glory of the Father with \n\n\n\n950 \n\n\n\nhis angels" to judge the world (Matthew 16:27). Theologians have \nnever really decided who was the Father of the Son of Man. \n\n1. OTlaherty, 349. 2. Rawson, E.A., 159. 3. Larousse, 310. \n\n\n\nSophia, Saint \n\nCanonical adaptation of the Gnostic Great Mother: Latin Sapientia, \nGreek Sophia, the spirit of Female Wisdom. Symbolized by the Dove \nof Aphrodite (later transformed into a sign of the Holy Ghost), \nSophia once represented God\'s female soul, source of his power, just as \nKali-Shakti served to vitalize the Hindu gods. 1 \n\nThe Trattato Gnostico said Sophia was God\'s mother, "the great \nrevered Virgin in whom the Father was concealed from the begin- \nning before He had created anything." She was identified with \nIsis-Hathor, whose seven emanations gave each Egyptian his seven \nsouls. Irenaeus said Sophia like Hathor was the mother of the seven \nplanetary spirits, whose names were listed in Gnostic papyri as the \nmagic-working secret names of God. 2 \n\nThe Clementine Homilies called Sophia the All-Maternal Being, \nThe Queen, Lady Wisdom. Early Gnostic Christians held that, like \nKrishna and Shiva, or like Dionysus and Zeus, Christ and God together \nmerged with Sophia as an androgyne: "The Son of Man agreed with \nSophia, his consort, and revealed himself in a great light as bisexual. His \nmale nature is called \'the Savior,\' the begetter of all things, but his \nfemale, \'Sophia, Mother of All.\' " ? \n\nA Gnostic creation myth said Sophia was born from the primordial \nfemale power Sige (Silence). Sophia gave birth to a male spirit, \nChrist, and a female spirit, Achamoth. The latter gave life to the \nelements and the terrestrial world, then brought forth a new god \nnamed Ildabaoth, Son of Darkness, along with five planetary spirits later \nregarded as emanations of Jehovah: Iao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi, and \nUraeus. These spirits produced archangels, angels, and finally men. \n\nIldabaoth or Jehovah forbade men to eat the fruit of knowledge, \nbut his mother Achamoth sent her own spirit to earth in the form of \nthe serpent Ophis to teach men to disobey the jealous god. The serpent \nwas also called Christ, who taught Adam to eat the fruit of knowledge \ndespite the god\'s prohibition. 4 \n\nSophia sent Christ to earth again in the shape of her own totemic \ndove, to enter the man Jesus at his baptism in the Jordan. After Jesus \ndied, Christ left his body and returned to heaven. Sophia gave Jesus a \nbody of ether, and placed him in heaven to help collect souls. 5 Some \nsaid Jesus became Sophia\'s spouse and his glory depended on this sacred \nmarriage; for he was only one of the Aeons, a minor spirit, the \ncommon fruit" of the Pleroma. 6 \n\nSome said Sophia was also Jesus\'s mother, for she was the Virgin \nof Light whose spirit entered into the body of Mary to conceive him. \n\n\n\nSophia, Saint \n\n\n\nClementine Homi- \nlies Greek writings \nfalsely attributed to a \nfirst-century bishop of \nRome; actually com- \nposed by an anonymous \nChristian apologist \ntoward the end of the \n4th century. \n\n\n\n951 \n\n\n\nSophia, Saint She also entered the body of Elizabeth to conceive John the Baptist. \n\nSome said Sophia was to God as Metis to Zeus: his "mind." But \n\nSophia wasn\'t acceptable to the all-male church. Of the three mighty \n\nfemale powers in the Gnostic creation myth, all preceded Jehovah, \nand two of them opposed Jehovah as a tyrant, overruled his taboo, and \nsaved humanity from ignorance. It was a version that the Pauline \nchurches found lacking in appeal. \n\nNevertheless, Sophia was passionately adored by Eastern Chris- \ntians. Her greatest shrine was erected in Constantinople during the \n6th century a.d., and was one of the wonders of the world: the Church \nof Holy Sophia (Hagia Sophia). \n\nEmbarrassed by this magnificent monument to the Great Mother, \nRoman Christians claimed it was dedicated to a minor "virgin \nmartyr," St. Sophia, whose phony legend lacked even a date. Despite \nher virginity she was the mother of three daughters, also "virgin \nmartyrs": St. Faith, St. Hope, and St. Charity. The legend may have \narisen in personification of the saying that Wisdom gives birth to \nFaith, Hope, and Charity. Hagiographers took it literally, confusing the \nthree virtues with the three Charites. Catholic scholars now claim the \nchurch of Hagia Sophia was never dedicated to the Great Mother in \nany form, not even that of a female saint. They say its name which \nmeans "Holy Female Wisdom" in plain Greek really meant "Christ, \nthe Word of God." 7 \n\nJewish "Wisdom" literature owed much to the cult of Sophia, who] \nwas to reappear in medieval Jewish cabalism as the Shekina of God. \nYet the 8th and 9th chapters of Proverbs demonstrate the early conflict \nbetween followers of Sophia and those of God. The first of these \npassages urges the benefits of Sophia\'s worship; the second belittles her \nand her priestesses: \n\nDoth not Sophia cry? and understanding put forth her voice? She \nstandeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. \nShe crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in of the \ndoors. Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. O \nye simple, understand Sophia: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding \nheart. Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my \nlips shall be right things . . . for Sophia is better than rubies; and all the \nthings that may be desired are not to be compared to her. I Sophia \ndwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. . . . \nCounsel is mine, and sound wisdom; lam understanding; I have \nstrength. By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. By me princes \nrule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. Hove them that love \nme; and those that seek me early shall find me. . . . I lead in the way of \nrighteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: that I may cause \nthose that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures. . . . \n\nBlessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, \nwaiting at the posts of my doors. For whoso findeth me findeth life. . . . \n\n\n\n952 \n\n\n\nBut he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate Soteira \n\nme love death. Sothis \n\nThis was one side of a public-relations war. The other side was hmmmmmm \n\npresented by the following chapter, wherein God scorned the worship \nof the Goddess: \n\nSophia hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: she \nhath killed her beasts: she hath mingled her wine: she hath also \nfurnished her table. She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the \nhighest places of the city. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; as for \nhim that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, Come, eat of my bread, \nand drink of the wine which I have mingled . . . [but] the fear of the \nLord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is \nunderstanding. For by me [God] thy days shall be multiplied, and the \nyears of thy life shall be increased. . . . A foolish woman is clamorous: she \nis simple, and knoweth nothing. For she sitteth at the door of her \nhouse, on a seat in the high places of the city, to call passengers who go \nright on their ways: whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. . . . But he \nknoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths \nof hell. 8 \n\nThe "high places of the city" meant temples, therefore the \n\'woman" was the Goddess, who met with much resistance from \nFollowers of the God. Yet she was still in evidence during the Middle \n\\ges, as Sophia-Sapientia, Lady Wisdom, ruling deity of the Gnostic \njhilosophers who said the World Soul was born of her smile. 9 \n\n1.

The word came from primitive images of \nhe Savior as a phallic god who died in the act of fertilizing the earth. \n3 ersephone acquired the title as an annual bride of Pluto, or Hades, \nvho took her underground. \n\n\n\nSothis \n\nSreco-Egyptian name of the star Sirius, which "rose in the east" to \ninnounce the advent of the Savior Osiris each year at the onset of the \n^lile flood. "Three Wise Men" announced the rising of Sothis the \nhree stars in Orion\'s belt which point directly toward Sirius. As the \n\'Eye" of the Great Dog (Canis Major), Sirius was sometimes called \n2anopis or Dog- Eye, the same as the holy city of Anubis who, as Dog \n\n\n\n953 \n\n\n\nSoul of Death, kept Osiris\'s soul in the star Sothis until his rebirth. See \nDog. \n\n\n\nSoul \n\nGermanic Seek, "soul," was feminine, used by mystics like Eckhart \nand Goethe in the same sense as Shakti\'m India: i.e., "the feminine \nUltimate Reality." \' Most ancient words for the soul were female: \npsyche, pneuma, anima, alma. God-souls were Goddesses: Kore, So- \nphia, Metis, Sapientia, Juno. The ancients believed every man had a \nfemale soul derived from the Mother Goddess through his earthly \nmother. \n\nEach Egyptian had seven souls, bestowed by the Seven Hathors \nwho guarded the planetary spheres and were fairy godmothers at the \nbirth of every child. The souls were aakhu, ab, ba, ka, khaibut, khat, and \nren: (1) primordial life spirit, resident in the blood; (2) the heart, \nformed from the mother\'s heart\'s blood; (3) the ghost that appeared \nafter death and flew in and out of the tomb, sometimes as a bird; (4) \nthe semblance or image, the other self seen in reflections; (5) the \nshadow; (6) the material living body, supposedly resurrected "in the \nflesh" after death; and (7) the secret name or soul-name. 2 \n\nGreeks connected different aspects of the soul with different \ndeities. Psyche, the spirit, was married to Eros, the body, until they \nwere separated by death: this was the philosophical meaning of the \nromantic myth of Psyche and Eros. Souls belonging to Persephone in \nthe underworld were shadows, or "shades" the umbra corresponding \nto the Egyptian khaibut (see Shadow). Reflection-souls in water \nseem to have been connected with the water-goddess Echo, as shown ! \nby the myth of Narcissus. \n\nPatriarchal writers tended to emphasize the soul called "breath," \npneuma, since this was the kind of soul that could be given by a \nfather. The idea came from Vedic India. Patriarchal Brahmans called \nthe vital principle, self, or soul Atmen, "breath," cognate of the \nGreek atmos, "air." Brahman fathers gave their children breath-souls as \nopposed to the souls of blood, heart, name, flesh, mind, shade, etc., \ncontributed by mothers. Therefore Brahmans regarded the breath-soul \nas the only important one. A Brahman father pretended to bring his \nnewborn infant to life by breathing on it three times, putting a soul into \nits body. 3 Like all Aryan notions, this one reappeared in Europe \ncenturies later, in a superstitious belief about lions. "For three days after \nbirth the cubs of the lioness gave no sign of life, but on the third day \nthe lion came and with his breath restored them to life." 4 \n\nThe biblical God performed the same miracle with breath, restor- \ning life to slain warriors who had become heaps of dry bones. At the \ninvocation of Ezekiel, God sent his breath into them from the winds, \nand they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great \narmy" (Ezekiel 37:10). We are always astonished at the ease with which \n\n\n\n954 \n\n\n\nthe ancient prophets ordered up impossible miracles, such as have Soul \n\nnever appeared within living memory. \n\nJesus\'s assertion that "the kingdom of God is within you" (Luke ^^^^^^^^^^^^ \n\n17:21) filtered down from Ionian philosophers of the 6th and 5th \ncenturies b.c. They identified the air-soul as God, and proposed that the \ndivine spark within man was precisely the air he breathed, the \n"finest" element, forming the personal soul and the Oversoul at the \nsame time. Diogenes of Apollonia set forth this doctrine: \n\nMankind and the other animals live on air, by breathing; and it is to them \nboth soul and mind. \n\nThe soul of all animals is the same, namely air which is warmer than \nthe air outside, in which we live, though much colder than that near \nthe sun. \n\nIn my opinion that which has intelligence is what men call air, and \nby it everything is directed, and it has power over all things; for it is just \nthis substance which I hold to be God. s \n\nThe philosophers reasoned that if God=air=soul, then the air \nwithin a breathing person was an inner God judging his actions an \ninterior conscience. So said the poet Philemon: \n\nlam he from whom none can hide, in any act which he may do, or be \nabout to do, or have done in the past, be he god or man. Air is my \nname, but one might also call me Zeus. I, as a god should be, am \neverywhere here in Athens, in Patrae, in Sicily, in all cities, in every \nhome, in every one of you. There is no place where is not Air. And he \nwho is present everywhere, because he is everywhere of necessity \nknows everything. 6 \n\nChristians largely accepted the air-soul theory, drawing out of it \ntheir ideas of invisible ghosts that could be felt but not seen, like air; and \nthe notion that the soul can depart from the body through the nose or \nmouth, like breath. Yet older ideas of the soul also hung on. \n\nThe Egyptian doctrine of the seven souls, descending from the \nseven planetary spheres, passed into Gnostic Christianity as seven \nqualities of souls drawn from, and influenced by, the planetary spheres. \nComing down from heaven to enter a newborn body, the soul had its \noriginal purity adulterated by sins and passions as it passed through the \nspheres: "As the souls descend, they draw with them the torpor of \nSaturn, the wrathfulness of Mars, the concupiscence of Venus, the \ngreed for gain of Mercury, the lust for power of Jupiter." Seven \ndeadly sins were acquired from the seven spheres, but they could be \nshed again after death as the soul ascended through the same spheres \nin the reverse direction, enroute to heaven. Christians generally restrict- \ned the number of souls to one, but some Gnostics held that every \nman has two souls, one emanating from the First Mind, and one called \nthe God-seeing soul, "put in from the revolution of the heavens." 7 \n\nTheories on the physical seat of the soul in the body have been \nmany and various. The ancients usually placed the soul in the heart \nor the liver. Patriarchal thinkers declared that a man\'s testicles held the \n\n\n\n955 \n\n\n\nSpeaking in Tongues \n\n\n\nSow souls of his future children; St. Thomas Aquinas and other Christian \n\nauthorities concurred in this. Some souls were external; they dwelt in \n\numbilical cords, placentae, nail clippings, or shorn hair; any injury to \n\nthese articles would injure the person. A more recent theory, dating \n\nfrom the early Age of Enlightenment, was that the seat of the soul is \n\nthe pineal gland. \n\n1 BardoThodol,xxx\\. 2. H. Smith, 24. 3. Hays, 223. 4. Male, 15. \n5.

As a death goddess, Freya had the title of \nSyr, "Sow." l Demeter-Persephone or "Demeter the Destroyer" was \nsometimes called Phorcis the Sow, mother of the Phorcids or Fatal \nWomen. One of these was Circe, swine-goddess of Aeaea, who could \nturn men into sacrificial pigs. 2 Her island Aeaea meant literally \n"Wailing," a reference to the ritual laments accompanying sacrifices of \nthe god in pig form. \n\nThe self-sacrifice of Vishnu in the form of a boar was repeated in \nwestern Indo-European myths, where the god was Porcus, Phorcus, \nor Orcus, a Lord of Death. Ore means "pig" in Irish; and the Orkney \nIslands were once sacred to the devouring Sow. 3 \n\nIn Tantric Buddhism the Goddess is still worshipped as the \nDiamond Sow, Marici. She sits on a lotus throne drawn by seven \npigs. On earth she is incarnate in a real woman, the female counterpart \nof the Dalai Lama. 4 See Boar; Vishnu. \n\n1. Turville-Petre, 168. 2.

Spartacus was a would-be Orphic savior, viewing \nhimself as an incarnation of the god. His wife, a priestess of Orpheus- \nDionysus, saw in a dream the Orphic serpent coiled around Spartacus\'s \nhead, indicating that he would do great deeds and would die a hero\'s \ndeath. 1 Her prophecy was fulfilled. Spartacus\'s revolt was soon put \ndown, and he was caught and executed in the manner of a sacred \nking. \n\nl.Dumezil,517. \n\n\n\nSpeaking in Tongues \n\nGlossolalia, "speaking in tongues," was often seen in episodes of \nreligious ecstasy or trance and was anciently considered a proof of divine \ngrace. St. Paul was proud of his ability to "speak in tongues" more \n\n\n\n956 \n\n\n\nthan any of his followers (1 Corinthians 14:18). Early Christians Sphinx \n\nactually believed the speaker in tongues was expressing himself in Spider \n\nanother language or languages not known to his conscious mind, ^^^^^^^^^^^m \n\nthrough temporary possession by the divine spirit. The idea came \noriginally from Buddhists who claimed that when Buddha addressed \ngods, demons, men, and animals, each heard the Enlightened One \nspeak in the language he could understand. 1 \n\nIn reality, glossolalia is only meaningless babbling that may pour \nforth from an entranced person. Not one authenticated case of \nspeaking in tongues has ever been observed, where any real language \nwas spoken and identified by a native speaker of the same language, \ntogether with evidence that the same language was wholly unknown to \nthe possessed one. \n\nl.Waddell, 159. \n\n\n\nSphinx \n\nMother Hathor as a lion-headed sphinx asked men her mystic riddle, \nand killed those who couldn\'t answer, until King Oedipus solved her \nriddle and cast her out of Thebes.
